perhaps the perfect action thriller movie . funny , suspenseful dramatic packed has it all
a well constructed thriller .
my favorite action movie yet !
i love this movie ! bought it on dvd when came out . it's better than the original , and jamie lee lindsey were great
funny
really funny
the first time i saw this was in a huge . packed cinema with surround sound etc..i left feeling exhausted , as if had actually been involved scenario excellent and you can watch it over again
funny movie all around . it's kinda weird to see professor mcgonagall from the harry potter flicks as a nun ! great musical interpetation of my guy by nun's choir rather than making fun religion , i think it shows that can be thing and there is nothing wrong with that!
on e of the best movies that whoopi made !
hysterical . the idea of whoopi goldberg as a nun is funny enough with soundtrack and dialogue in this movie , it's flat excellent
this is the venue whoopi needs to stick too . acting
the greatest action movie ever made .
this is an excellent movie , it still makes me laugh to day . i highly recommend for the whole family most of whoopi's earlier work was so awesome sister act 2 as well wish they would come out with part 3 too  !
i nearly peed my pants ! it is so funny . whoope goldberg a gem
whoopi goldberg can be funny at times , but she's so often in films that don't fit with her style . sister act was the perfect film for a vegas lounge singer hiding from mob convent predictably she turns lives of nuns upside down and they effect have big influence on personalities show's stars--whoopi harvey keitel mary wickes kathy najimy maggie smith--are winning you overlook some obvious cliches
i loved this movie . i've watched it again and laugh every time the sequel ruined series goldberg plays role of sister mary clarence superbly
this movie is another comedy classic . whoopi goldberg becomes a nun in funny the doesn't plod too much and humor present , especially church scenes highly recommended ! nod to flying would have made it even better
very well done from every angle.a tough action film to beat .
i really like this movie . you're right on , more songs less arguing the are brilliant and is funny andrea robinson singing voice for wendy makkena's character sounds an angel hail holy queen  love !
sister act left you wanting more . the movie needs songs , less arguing
whoopi goldberg was really good  . very singing working with bad kids , helping them change their ways
adorable and hilarious .
hilarous and funny kick ace movie love it !
great film , alan rickman is one of my favorite things about this .
one of adam's best . those kids playing frankenstein were great do you want to put on a hooters shirt for old times sake ? whats he talking about mommy
it funny and sweet , all round good movie
i loved this movie ! the action is great , and like how bruce willis gets his butt kicked throughout (unlike other i-can-kick-high-so-bullets-can't-hurt-me movies.) alan rickman plays a villain . even though totally dated now it's still fun brain candy
this movie is hallirous ! the little boy dang cute it has something for everyones taste if you have not seen yet i suggest that go down to blockbuster right now and rent , will luv it!
a good comedy should be hilarious of course , but it also tell story that alters the main character in some way as well touches and engages viewer . big daddy has all adam sandler was flawless brilliant!! ! must-see!!
i love adam sandler , especially in this movie . he looks like would be a great daddy too bad can't play the mommy :)
this is one of my favourite movies . it's really funny and sweet too adam sandler does a great job the little boy in movie cute definitely worth seeing
so u agree...u think you're really pretty ?
amazing movie , shame it didnt have a few of the trailer clips in which i was suprised at . but really funny and makes you think not too fussed on lyndsey lohan bt liked her this ace! !
a genius movie . my favorite of all time with perhaps few disney classics as exceptions tina fey is writer
a blast ! bought the dvd set . great comic book escapism alan rickman was terrific
along with lethal weapon , die hard easily makes my list of the top action films lasy 20 years . it's your typical shoot em' up flick willis playing macho cop john mcclane who must face off terrorists in an office building 3,000 miles out his jurisdiction solid performances by and reginald veljohnson are film's high points but biggest props have to go alan rickman a relatively unknown actor played role hans gruber very convincingly overall is film watch if you're looking for some good mixed little bit comedy
great film and carey proves he can act when wants to prove it but i don't think belongs in the comedy category .
classic action-film . i just saw it for the 4th or 5th time couldn't change channel bad guy was as good , if not better than bruce willis
great movie jenna elfman rules
jenna elfman rules
a fantastic movie ; side splittingly funny at times , romantic poignant . it plays on the rabbi/priest stereotypes with humour but sensitivity happy ending is of course not unexpected film sets out to end note friendship prevails strong directing debut from edward norton one most talented actors around today and he jenna elfman ben stiller are all very believable in their roles great
this movie was great! ! i can't think of anything bad to say about . the cast great , acting just love ben stiller and edward norton jenna elfman is breath-taking!!
extremely funny . great acting , script i work in a video store and everyone loved it
very funny , especially norton wallach and forman !
by far the best of hannibal trilogy movies . anthony hopkins , jodie foster and entire cast work so well together this movie did book justice creepy sadistic thrilling a classic !
innocent people were held hostage in a high rise building , and bruce willis saves the day . storyline was easy to follow action top notch even though movie made way back it has lots of good gun fights similar john woo films had tough guy sort look throughout whole he perfect for role i would agree that this original one is best trilogy
edward norton is so hugable and cute!!! ! i love that guy . what a babe
wow i would actually want to be friends with these characters , and very seldom find that true this kind of movie .
great movie ! very funny and a unique topic . not stupid the way lot of movies are trying to be quality humor
this movie was hilarious . the actors worked well together and fit their parts
wonderful . i loved the extension and development of priest/rabbi jokes great acting from edward norton , ben stiller jenna elfman
this movie was the best of all die hards..an amazin trilogy it has been..hopefully they make fourth one..bruce willis is amazin...all explosions in were truly amazin..the dialogue good even tho most only abuses..this proves one thing..bruce god action movies
jenna elfman , ben stiller and edward norton do justice to one of the oldest jokes around . a priest rabbi walk into a.. this is movie that all will enjoy if you grew up in jewish or catholic religion you'll have better appreciation where come from be laughing your butt off !
this movie was great . the about three people who were best friends when they younger one became a priest , rabbi and girl fell in love with of them at same time other guy her triangle formed between characters
i love this movie !
great competitive movie with a sense of humor that was also emotionally tear jerking at the end , but it ended well . i would go see again
very much a good movie . shows they way that cheerleaders work lots of hotties
packed full of action . being a dancer , it was very exciting to me i like watching cheerleading competitions
the movie had an interesting plot about how they were always winning and ended up losing to rival . has a good ending
i think this movie was great from its success in combining comedy and a real life case . it had all sorts of high school guys getting together challenging teamwork to make dream come true one side , many funny situations the other made you feel what challenge means lets hit with muzik!! !
a genre defining film with lead character that was tough but vulnerable . i still watch this on regular basis as it became the action picture by which most others are compared willis perfectly cast for role and rickman gives fantastic performance
luved it yeah baby ! to see kirsten d in a yummy cl uniform wow that my feinds is film making the only dumb point was make race issue with 'those black chix' who were always sour combative mood , cares steals dance moves?? ? i went jump around and did she deliver other girl major cupcake also mmmmmmmmm but her dufus brother playing air gee-tar lame . -----todd michael wiseman ohio univ college of cinematography
bring it on is a great movie , especially for young people . it's about cheerleaders teenagers etc i think that and worth the money spent i'm willing to buy when comes out
exellent its one of the best action films all time dynomite
bring it on starts with no storyline but the story picks up . dancing is awesome and i enjoyed drama
a classic shoot-em-up , kill-the-bad-guys movie that should rank up there with dirty harry . it ranks #146 out of 250 films all time on imdb.com -- the comedic one liners are skillfully written into predominately violent this was also make-or-break for bruce willis to see if he could break moonlighting tv show mold did flawlessly and became an a-list actor
thosee girls where so hot . the movie was funny also
i think it is a totally awesome movie!alicia great and hav 2 give snaps stacy an donald they were so funnyyo whats up u jeepin behind my back?ha
i don't care how lame , or stupid some people think this movie is it still has a great story line and definately feel good coming of age . wasn't filled with garbage too much sex perfect teen that if had teenagers my own would recommend to them alicia silverstone talented actress who will go far she keeps her talent pointed in the right direction
if you don't like this movie , might be a german mercenary . one of the greatest bang for your buck action movies ever made it's filled with non-stop explosions gunfire and an occasional laugh or two yippie kye yi yeah!!! !
this movie is not just good as a teen comedy , it great ! it's so funny and alicia silverstone perfect the rich beverly hills girl . classic i'll always watch if on tv
i have been obsessed with this movie since it came out when was in 7th grade . took me 20 times watching to figure the hip lingo and even counted cher's outfits:42 !
this was a great flick . it's okay to be ditzy , especially when funny
this is my all time favortie movie . it hilarious and upbeat , even though she seems ditzy we can relate to cher's problems
good comedy for teenagers . really cute movie about sex and
i don't ordinarily think of this as a great movie , but it is one that -- when you click by and see on tv always want to watch . the script really memorable storyline oddly sweet characters are pulled off convincingly
love it ! uh... . i can't play tennis , coach because my plastic surgeon tells me shouldn't have balls flying at face there goes her social life ha
this is great ! i was blown away the first time saw it , it's hilarious sad everything . peter sellers absolutely wonderful as chance and being there just a movie loved atmosphere don't think can find much wrong with you should see if you're fan summary : marvelous
while i can't enjoy this movie everytime see it as much did the first time saw , still holds a place among top films of all . has peter sellers in who kubrick put into three roles dr strangelove and was perhaps only person capable outdoing george c scott's work that film is from lolita pink panther one most talented actors comedic or otherwise ever he plays childlike man accidentally raised to role brilliant philosopher presidential economic advisor public figure through series strange seemingly divinely inspired events manage appear funny charming simultaneously being insanely unlikely full heart beauty also bitingly satirical both its tv-brainsucker-victims ours requires complete attention especially for delicate sequences at end seller's understated delivery which times so poignant be painful best
this was a great movie . gene wilders more serious movies , and contains actimg humor is one of the better wilder
like i said there isnt one movie with johnny depp that dont loved it he was a really funny guy in and yeah great .
john waters is truly one of the best out there in entertainment industry . this musical a movie was so cute , i enjoyed it ricki lake also did great job highly recommend to fans and alike
it's probably one of the only musicals i actually like . it stars johnny depp as a very angry self-confessed juvenile delinquent with his friends milton , wanda and milton's girlfriend hatchet-face then they befriend an uptight prudish girl named allison vernon williams (amy locane) their lifestyles collide lots hysteria chaos unravels
it's been rather difficult of late doing without any bruce willis die hard movies . realizing course how john mcclain is pretty much worn out...ca-poots-kah.. ! but who can blame the dude , after all those disgusting messes grueber dudes put him through ya know what i'm sayin ? guys had climbin up elevator shafts and shootin at then blowin things around john...and terrible stuff like that oh well thanks for memorys you were a shining example courage in nypd...fer sure perhaps now john's exhausted his role as super ny cop...well maybe get on rent cop with some night warehouse east side best ever ; series yep no doubt about it...fer was
real great movie its about a girl who wants to find her true dreams well then theres some problems not just easy squezzy she has boy likes and almost get fired
love this movie !
piper perabo hubba
so adrenalizing yet humorous . it sure is at the top of my list for action films
ok folks , it's not going to win an oscar and be shown at the cannes film festival but it is a great movie . piper perabo who played lead character violet has that aww shucks sexy girl next door look you would either want for your daughter or girlfriend music was i personally like leann rimes plays herself in this does actual singing movies their entertainment value sit down relax entertained me
okay , so it's corny and cliche'd but also a lot of fun . i really like it 'cause got that feel good factor about the soundtrack is too ending pure cheese fantastic!! !
i loved this movie . think it was great that she followed her dreams tells a story one of the best movies ever
very entertaining . the sound track carried movie characters were believable and fun to watch what everyone who has never been new york hopes it is really like john goodman as father was a great addition
at first , i thought it would be a retarded movie until my friends showed to me . coyote ugly wold mainly about strippers or some thing but was wrong an excellent that can even show mom
this was so much fun !
i loved it!! ! want to be a coyoty ugly for life!! the music was awesome and used dancer so couldn't sit still . love how it made women feel like they rule!!
i didnt think coyote ugly was going to be all that great . boy wrong!the plot definetley more than thought , the music and really got into movie !
coyote ugly was a wonderful movie , i think it really gives you inspiration . no matter how many times watch always bring smile to my face
coyote ugly is my favorite movie . the girls were great especially piper perabo i love her so much would do anything to meet she most amazing , beautiful woman have ever seen
great movie . true , there are implausibilities ; who was where when sgt al first radioed for help ? but effort to tie different parts of the together much is foreshadowed on airplane bruce willis a soon be barefoot cop
coyote ugly was a fantastic movie ! i love the story line and cast it made me want to get up become . two thumbs great
i thought that coyote ugly was a great movie!! ! makes you believe if put your mind to it , can make dreams come true . i'm in the business and would love own bar like music also stays with you'll be singing for days until finally buy c.d
coyote ugly was one of the best movies ever ! granted , speaking as a guy i don't really have much bias given girls but at least it had plot and i'm thankful for that . my suggestion to you is if like attractive women romantic comedies...i would definitely see this movie
very predictable storyline and plot , but it was still a good movie . great line dancing in the had enough ending
this movie was a very fun . i think the storyline cute , it kind of made you what/who really want to be in life or what path take
another great movie that i didn't mind paying eight dollars to watch . this was a total chick flick went see it with my sister and enjoyed so much talking about for hours afterwards
it was a better movie than i thought would be . is chick and dude because of the girls sentiment
the greatest ordinary superhero of all time fights terrorists and beats them starting with one gun no shoes .
good , sexy movie . i like the music and cast of characters started out slow but finale
this was a good movie about how some women get paid for doing job as bartender . there is plot her singing career she never gave up
i liked this movie because it has hot girls dancing in . think appeals to many guys there is also a theme the follow your dreams , which pretty cool since will attract something for everyone
emotional , sexy and funny- all elements of a good movie .
a great adrenaline rush , real guy movie with buildings blowing up left and right . die hard two three are not as good the original bruce willis was man in
this movie was great ! it showed how girls can do something all on their own and make a difference without needing help from anyone else . i loved the music storyline , awesome
i thought this movie was really good . it left me in a feel mood very interesting there hasn't been any movies out lately about singer
when i went to go see coyote ugly just thought that it was going be about the bar . but really one girl who worked in and her struggle a songwriter , which made much more interesting all of jokes plot twists kept your attention emotions edge seat
this is a wonderful and excellent movie!!!! !
the storyline was great and i feel it pleased both male female crowds . really liked
i loved this movie because of the fun adventure that young girl goes through . cast is and liked it they made so believeable audience want to go be a bartender(and buy soundtrack)
that is the best movie if you like singing dancing and boot kicking this your movie!!! ! oh by way don't liten to people 2 stars lower great , but take any advice want .
i loved this movie ! it was a good chick flick that would go to even with guys . my boyfriend liked because of the hot chicks dancing on bar and drinking all alcohol
a great action movie . lots of one-liners , cool explosions and good plot bruce willis is the man
movie has girls . guy flick attractive good plot
i loved this movie ! it was just a really fun (not to mention adam garcia!) the music awesome and found myself singing 'can't fight moon light' for weeks . 5 stars
this movie is really good . it shows that girls can have a time while running bar me and my friends related to the characters in
an explosive terrorist movie . the first of it's kind i found this to be extremely well done and bruce willis was outstanding
black women in all-white neighborhoods are funny .
the fighting scenes aren't so fake like in those steven segal movies . only movie that i of his
this is probably the first comedy i have seen in theatres year that was actually worth watching . it great  ! laughed all way thru one queen latifah exactly as she called movie..she and only cocoa goddess definately stood out movie for steve martin , never loved him or anything he showing his age but regardless hilarious can't wait to buy on dvd
i have seen this movie 4 times in theatres all ready- and mr . good dosent know what hes talking about- is one of the funniest films a long time great film
very funny ! enjoyed every minute of it .
offensive , but hilariously funny comedy . steve martin plays a divorced lawyer who's life is pretty dull his revolves around two children and he gets little free time that until charlene played by queen latifah comes into she wants him to help her call out true innocence find the person who committed crime for which charged with hilarius supporting cast of betty white jean smart eugene levy...you can't get any better
great movie , with some hysterical moments . jim carrey is in this i'd recommend you skip the sequel though
this movie established jim carrey as one of the most hilarious and goofy guys all time . got me hooked on i remember kids trying to impersonate his craziness
what are you talking about lukskywlkr ? this was the funniest movie i have ever witnessed ! guess don't a sense of humor anyone agree
this has got to be the funniest movie out there . jim carrey his fabulous ! what heck is it doing all way down at 127?? ?
i think this is a great movie  . have seen so many times know it word for through the whole and can do fast-talking sequence ( what you wouldn't read about how ray finkle lost his mind was committed to mental hospital only escape join police force under assumed identity of missing hiker manipulating way top in diabolical scheme get even with dan marino who he blamed entire thing ) faster than jim carrey yet still laugh at jokes my favourite part when ace turns up finkles house says hi , i'm looking then shotgun pointed head replies clean pair shorts asked over phone by courtney cox where phsychoville finkle's mayor all one carreys best performances sequel crap
die hard was a good movie . the actors were they storyline great , how he had to save building
this movie does get annoying but it makes up with all the lauphs . jim carry is a great actor any charecter yoou give him , he'll make work
perfectly wild physical comedy from the master himself . a fun movie and classic of it's kind
i love this movie even though am not a big fan of jim carey . is sooooo funny ! have seen it lot with my best friend but , we still crack up through most the
my best friend and i love this movie!! ! we've seen movie a lot every time we laugh at it really enjoy but have to admit , like the sequal better(ace ventura when nature calls)
great action packed movie with bruce willis where he tries to save a building from terrorists . i found it be very crafty plot that was well executed
so funny , if i would've been filming it wouldv'e a little iffy but they took chance and worked !
- hilarious  . very funny , it will make you laugh on the worst day they picked right actor for movie (jim carrey)
an excellent wild and extravagant comedy where jim carrey is completely insane , but yet a plot still exists .
released in 2002 and directed by alexander payne , about schmidt is a dark comedy that has very flat intentionally plodding pace . the film almost exclusively centers around warren (jack nicholson) who forced into retirement from his job as an insurance actuary quickly finds wife essentially stranger he turns to sponsoring orphan boy africa named ndugu after unexpectantly dies search of entertainment change purchases rv begins trip colorado try stop daughter (hope davis) marrying waterbed salesman (dermot mulroney) arriving faced with future in-law (kathy bates) viewers looking for more action miss point this humor dialogue driven match aura schmidt's new life though in-laws are supposed be portrayed eccentric over top bates' persona was bit excessive ; however davis no frills wonderful what makes work casting effort nicholson can portray man boiling inside yet never erupts save within anonymity letters which highlights move story along bottom line cerebral black not everyone but must see those like genre
it was great . i liked the explosions tight how dude fell at end more good stuff
three words...kathey bates naked!! !
i had no idea what this film was about when went to see it and pleasantly surprised . very humourous enjoyable watch jack nicholson perfect in the lead role have say that incredibly refreshing an older male actor playing a reflects his age...someone who's married woman own age , retiring dealing with being senior citizen basically narration is brilliant because it's constructed through letters which character writes ndugu child he sponsers world vision those letter provide funniest moments entire film...i practically choking laughter at some of things
kathy bates stole the show . great acting and deserves a definite 5
a great movie...gained new respect for nicolson....it tugged at lot of emotions....dealt with issues people my age face. .
jack nicholson really plugs you in (and what else would expect?) to this heart-warming film . he plays man who needs deal with the inevitable circumstancs of age and retirement which suddenly befall him , find his way a life that has become routine taken for granted it is sad at same time comic see stumble around new shoes but rest comedy depends on whether or not you're from country can roll punches these characters are over-the-top schlocky if all fails kathy bates hot tub debut fun hilarious times ultimately uplifting about schmidt sweet ride
i gave this a 5 because movie was ahead of its time . it the first badass , hostage dituation where bad guys are being chased by good guy all three die hard movies awesome but original has best storyline
is there really anything better than watching jack nicholson and kathy bates in the same movie?? ?
a fantastic movie about recent retiree (nicholson) who is looking back on his life while facing final years . parts of the story are told through letters nicholson writes to child in africa that he sponsoring , which adds nice touch kathy bates steals every scene where she appears her supporting role
great movie , i recommend it for anyone in the mood a good hearted film . jack nicholson was just this much funnier than what thought going to be one of best movies 2002 must see
i feel pretty , o so & witty gay !
they picked the perfect actor adam sandler to be in anger management he looks just like type flip out .
this movie is bruce willis' best . he performs extremely well i was on the edge of my seat whole sincerely recommend it
wounderful i still laugh when think of it .
completely equal if not superior to the origional . another hilarious movie with a whole lot of whacky comedy i loved it when he tried prove that dr mainheimer was fake by trying scrub his birthmark off absolutely and imo better than first
extremly funny sequel .
one of the best sequels all time . however , 33 1/3 really sucked
gossip....gossip...we want gossip... .
definately a classic , brings me back to when i went summer camp except it was never like this movie.. .
my favorite bruce willis movie . you gotta love the scene when he runs through cut glass
b-b-but this is such a great movie ! only thing i didn't like was sigourney weaver---catherine the wrong role for her to play . why so far down ? it crazy , laugh-out-loud perfect me since am kind of person anyone who doesn't must just not funny things or else have problem reviewer called alicat says best good it's time and still
this film will be studied in years to come . the subtlties pay re-watching it
every single one is great !
this is one of my favorite comedies all time . i love movie every robin hood he has been hero since was like 3 years old so cool
- i think callmetootie's lizard's looking a little limp .
a great comedy and does job as spoof . cary elwes is comic actor , dave chapelle the funniest guy alive callmetootie here ? cause i hate her
this is one of the greatest movies all time , next to wayne's world austin powers and a life less ordinary .
this movie was thrilling from beginning to end . very few dull spots , and jodie foster is so believable in her character that it gave me goose bumps while i normally do not care for movies involve serial killers a must-see those seeking good can be kinda scary at times as well recommended children however
i remember when went to see this . people had told me how good it was , but wasn't expecting very much after all starred bruce willis boy wrong is a great action movie which catipulted from television the big screen while parts follow simple formula (superhero fighting evil) has sub-plot surrounding scumbag reporter also liked second one he probably should have stopped there
god , i don't know how many times have seen this movie .
mel brooks is the man ! this and every other movie has done i have loved , hilarious
my favorite movie of all time ! the auditioning scenes and you're bastard people are genius . characters hilarious , dim clueless but you find yourself loving them rooting for anyway
like watching the best comedy before your very eyes . in it's year , and had a great ensemble cast
christopher guest is wonderful in this movie . he was born to be it ! nothing may ever happen on mars but something definitely cooking blaine , missouri a delightful play for people of all ages if you have not seen peice comedic genius then lived
i woke up at 3:00 in the morning on a worknight and decided to watch tv till fell back asleep.i came across this movie,and my goal went from trying fall asleep not waking rest of household with laughter
very , funny .
hysterical parody . this is spinal tap in a small town community theatre
one of the most hilarious movies you can see . a christopher guest documentary masterpiece , it takes place in blaine missouri where corky st claire  flamboyant theatre director/composer/actor writes red white and low-budget show about history i have yet to this is spinal tap another piece work but surely take look at waiting for guffman also..
mel is the man , whoever does not appreciate this light hearted comedy should definatly think about thier values they put on movies . basically get ahold of your sexuality if you are going to take too seriously it was fun
i own the dvd . helen hunt is amazing
this was a hell of movie . funny , clever mel and helen have fantastic chemistry etc
bruce willis/script make this a great action movie .
mel gibson was funny ! who knew ? great message about what men are missing .
very funny
mel gibson is the best
i give this movie a 5 for origionality and charm ! mel gibson helin hunt get two thumbs up
didn't understand it but made me laugh !
frances mcdormand was fabulous in this movie . "i suppose that's your partner the wood chipper."
the jokes never seemed to wear out for me  , even though i went see movie 4 times . it was a brilliant film brings you back second time reccomend this anyone who wants mel gibson's acting in different kind of genre it's great helen hunt and definetly look cute together go !
hillarious!!!! !
what women want...was absolutly hilarious ! and can nick marshall ever show the audiance a good time in sack its must see this will be out on video may 8th , 2001 mel-hugs nan
hilarious , nasty and utterly brilliant . one of the best films decade
an instant classic !
very funny . i enjoy this movie so much that can watch it over and
alright , the norwegian accents are way over top but this is still destined for cult status .
it was a very funny movie every body played there part well and picked the perfect person for .
one of the best road movies ever made
just a good movie . really nothing of merit dramawise , nor acting that could be called great it somehow works keeps you interested from the begining untill end ijr says check out !
have given this movie a five because it gives you what want - funny , engaging film that leaves satisfied paid your money to watch . with some movies are waiting for the laughs materialise but has high quota both visual and in dialogue clever editing/storytelling keep plot moving apace start off liking characters by end rooting them all their travails life be retrieving sex video or getting laid there subplots too such as tom green's attempt feed snake girl's trip boston instead of austin writers used premise if we could do anything wanted get away would ? so see theft blind school's bus an all-black fraternity house masturbation car jumping it's good fun i recommend film....although not parents !
the funniest movie i have seen in my entire life . such incredible comedic feat will take a huge comedy to parralell tom green did spectacular job must see
this was a really good movie . i loved it original and funny keeps you constantly laughing so holds your attention right throughout the
this movie was as good it gets ! though its not the best , close to if ur in early 20's or a teenager will defidently make u laugh
road trip is hilarious ! with many classic lines and situations , this movie a must see . i recommend it whole heartedly
so funny ! see it with college pals and laugh your butt off
this was the funniest movie i've seen in years . i highly impressed thought it would be dumb with tom green , but he only has a minor part great for guys especially
great movie . not only is tom green hysterical , but the was funny as a whole it definitely worth money to see
very funny , great movie ! tom green was . the story good as well
tom green plays a hilariously wierd college student . plenty of nudity and lot funny parts scenes the plot was better than expected movie hilarious
it is a funny depiction of fictional college life . overall , i was amused
classic . hopkins - great ! i like it when looks jodie foster is going to shoot me
adaptation is the only movie of this past christmas season that actually lived up to its promise . do not listen critics who will tell you it's gimmicky or it tries too hard be post postmodern even worse -- much unravels and falls apart at end these were paying attention ! when you're watching become aware seems alive growing making itself as film runs through projector seeing interplay between things happen our hero , he learns experiences how those affect script got made into watching.. thrilling nothing less than all movies should original entertaining dare i say deep don't skip one gangs new york but
one of eddie murphy's greatest films . even arsenio couldn't mess this film up
the movie was great who cannot love macauley ? lets just say he's a pretty cool guy , believe me take it from someone knows him well .
very funny i liked it alot .
probably more of a dark comedy than an action thriller - one my favorites.. .
mackauley caulkin at his best  ! a wonderful , hilarious movie for the whole family to enjoy . it is an even better watch during holidays i absolutely loved
hilarious slapstick romp !
sweet , original comical and it has a lot of heart . i could watch over again
this movie is a classic . however , the older you get more seem to dislike film from child's point of view deserves 5 for cartoon-like comedy joe pesci was excellent in but nothing special after reach age 12
classic...if macaulay culkin could have stayed that age forever , he would be the richest guy alive . callmetootieblows
i don't think it can be noted for a great deal of cinematic brilliance , but is nonetheless favorite among people around my age (13-19) . must have seen 35 times kids just love seeing the idea 10-year-old outsmarting two criminal bandits physical abuse they endure at hands kevin mccallister extremely humorous part also everyone has been angry their family and felt left out one point or another ; teaches that you to look past with your (especially during holiday season)
i loved it . had some great moments hilarious and scary as hell
this is one we try to catch every christmas . kevin gets left alone , and he winds up fending off crooks who are trying clean the place out some of it barely believable credibility stretched limit but put your brain on hold for an hour a half you'll probably enjoy
great christmas movie!!!! !
once in a few years , one movie comes out that is total surprise to you and eventully find everyone else thought felt the same way . home alone best of 1990 culkin just such sweetheart great kid
this was so funny . macauly culkin cute in movie now is a classic i loved because it how he acted when alone- going to the store and doing laundry if were alone would just sit around do nothing , but smart kid what did
good christmas movie about having a kid at home being robbed and he gives the robbers time of their life .
home alone was a great movie to watch by yourself or with some friends young old . it is funny , and good entertainment which you don't see too much nowadays i would tell everyone this
this movie changed the world , history film industry ! showed us something we hadn't seen before one of few things that still give me christmas feeling and it's my favourite comedies as well family films yeh : macaulay culkin is absolutely fantastic :o)
a fun fantasy
as with most reese witherspoon flicks , the key word is cute . this movie was a pleasant surprise actors were all talented that charmed you typical sweet story of country girl goes to big city lost love and having choose between two worlds predictable but joy it want happen predictably...with happy ending
released in 1996 and directed by joel coen , fargo is an eccentric black comedy detective film set primarily minnesota . for the uninitiated plot involves dishonest car salesman jerry lundegaard (william h macy) who must find money quick to bail him out of insurance scam gone bad his plan hire two thugs (steve buscemi peter stormare) kidnap wife so he can get ransom from rich father-in-law course goes resulting several murders which brings local (and pregnant) sheriff marge gunderson (frances mcdormand) on case while hacking through clues schemes deal with weather odd citizens food cravings many ways this like a full-feature episode television's northern exposure steroids given characters climate screenplay ; however what makes movie performances macy mcdormand especially latter's portrayal swarthy kidnapper carl showalter stark contrast slower paced nordic scenery hare gunderson's turtle adds feeling tension inevitability story macy's spins wheels proverbial quicksand only deeper into quagmire created himself bottom line that not everyone typical brothers those cerebral see
great movie , especially the jailhouse scene when they did their little dance .
i loved this movie.. . reeves was not the best but other charactors made movie great ! really liked brian murphy , deaf guy ( david denmark) he so cute!! also from wales it a cute
the coen brothers at their best
funny movie ! character development was well thought out . storyline had good conclusion , although obvious kept me laughing and thrilled the whole time
this movie was full of comedy , action and had a little bit romance . the football scenes were great there many funny parts
i loved it !
adorable!! ! funny , querky sweet . everything for everyone
great acting . haunting story and the comedy made it more so william h macy was ! coen brothers got me i believed for longest time that this a somewhat true but now hear wasn't it's new low to introduce film as then have be just joke
i loved this movie soooooo much! ! it proves that the snotty b@#ch in your class and stoner dude can possibly be prom dates .
a great movie with so many funny scenes its unbelievable,harrelson,murray and quaid were brilliant . just like every1 else i didnt know why it wasnt big hit-it certainly shouldve been
murray and harrelson are unbeleivably funny
the farrelly brothers' funniest movie . it should have been a hit along lines of there's something about mary-- i don't know why wasn't this thing is hysterical , and politically incorrect mel brooks could made in '70s love
if you like silly movies will love this film...it's a keeper !
the characters/actors are what make this movie great . it's a bit dark and violent , so i would not recommended to everyone jerry lundegaard has some financial problems he hires people kidnap his wife they demand ransom from her rich father things take turn for worse when end up killing jerry's pregnant police chief is hot on trail william h macy excellent as francis mcdormand funny refreshing steve buscemi superb psychopath fresh thrilling quite possiblly coen brothers best film
hilarious movie from beginning to end . bill murray is great in every i've seen him
one of the funniest movies i have seen! ! talk about bad luck! loved big earn'!!
this movie is sick but absolutely hilarious one of my favorite comedies especially the part with his landlord . come on,it wasn't that bad 
this movie kicked ass ! funny as all hell
great movie -- i'm usually lukewarm about the coen brothers , but this really touched me . my favorite part was that cop's husband turned out to be designing stamps seemed at once humbe and noble
wow . hugh grant is amazing jeez , i can't get enough of him want to see again and again!!!! ! he's on my top ten list (of male celebs) just so cool such a good actor it's really hard for me not love this movie shows his great talent julia always will be one the best in book
was not based on a true story , contrary to what the movie claims . i don't care surprised that austin powers ranked higher than this one and then more wasn't even ranked...ah they call comedy? ? have theory...if you're from upper midwest you probably can't relate enough really enjoy it my favorite scene interrogation of driveway sweeper ! gotta love parkas
i think people miss the point with this movie . it's not a comedy tragedy and good one
real good movie , not as rushmore but the scene where it blatently shows painting in backround with 4 wheelers masks on has to be one of funniest things i've ever seen .
i think fargo is an excellent movie because it's not what you expect . don't even know thought it was going to be about , but when heard a wood chipper had see the performances were right down accents (and yes people do talk like that in n.d/mn wasn't exaggeration born fargo) this william h macy's best performance (portraying jerry lundergard) love finance company keeps hounding him vin numbers for vehicles truly helarious questioned why called after all only scene took place first five minutes of where deal set majority brainard mn then finally got would rather or  ? makes sense huh
it's hard for me to find any flaws with this movie . gene hackman steals the show as royal tenenbaum - an obnoxious patriarch who is trying bring his hysterically disfunctional family back together again heavyweight cast of , ben stiller gwyneth paltrow owen and luke wilson danny glover anjelica huston turn in nearly perfect performances wes anderson adds same quirky touches that made rushmore such outstanding film will make you laugh out loud may choke up a little well give sense how it was received theater where i saw most people applauded when over tenenbaums one better movies have seen last year or so
a very offbeat comedy that offends just about everybody . taking place in the 60s or 70s (when it was filmed) , it's an advertising agency with token black guy on board of directors when head dies and they have to select new ceo votes for assuming nobody else will therefor won't be giving vote likely offer them competition he takes over his first speech says "i want you know i'm not here rock boat sink f----er!" ads produce thereafter are hilarious !
putney swope is an outrageously funny comedy about race relations in imaginery madison avenue ad agency the late 1960's . without a doubt , it funniest movie ever made and because of way pokes fun at minorities will never be shown on television you'll laugh so hard wet your pants !
one of the funnest , and best shows year .
terrific movie . the best teen since clueless
terrific movie and different from everything else in its genre . i loved every minute
i totally enjoyed this film . thought that it was in fact a really good representation of the kind ennui some us felt after highschool think also speaks about kids today , post modern sense fashion trying to create look your own and build ideas from what has gone before is important looking at why society forming way didn't came across as too biased favor characters they were often made rediculous reminded me confusion we feel form our identities thoughout lives mocked collector you could read social commentary well live such an affluent can collect things most don't have worry day survival amass luxury items keep them on shelves forever expanding even around lot into there meat grab lots talk mark
a truly solid movie - great plot deep , funny and well made . i like the sci-fi thriller drama guy movies however- this was such movie- it goes on top 20 list keeps you intereste regardless whether go with your friends or date !
very good film . i had been anticipating this picture heavily ever since fallen in love with thora birch american beauty was not dissapointed movie which is based off a sorely under appriciated graphic novel of the same title takes place following graduation two teenage girls who have always planned on moving together and being forever friends their pleasure scrutinizing making fun strangers one day they are reading personals come across that man has placed seeking woman he met plane ride find utterly pathetic deside to call him , pretending be set date then go watch as never shows up thora's character becomes curious about (steve buscimi) slowly grows attached her best friend away from top form bitter comedy she mastered girl can't wait see next film.simplistic mature subject highly recommended
very funny , smart . i love the ironic satire and unpredictable situations steve bushemi is awsome(one of my favorite actors) as well rest cast directed a must see !
a diffrent teenage movie good story about after high school and what to do now it had the dark hair girl from american beauty great steve buseim .
excellent . also preety origional not many movies are about people who hang out at a mall it was funny watching silent bob try to use jedi powers the stink pawm i should gag someone with that someday well here and there this movie has its legendary moments
can you say excellent ? this movie was so hilarious . a definate classic in the arena of comedy movies jason lee and shannen doughtery were wonderful kevin smith is just totally awesome
kevin smith does it again with mallrats . this movie is insanely hilarious jason lee and jeremy london both play incredibly funny characters , the dialogue between two although lacking any amount of intelligence comic genius
wicked
wow what can i say ? does one base this answer on directing skills , of the actors special effects well definately is that kevin smith pure genius . his characters are different each character's personality specially suited for person playing roll tell u my favorite movie all time noochie noochies everyone'
this is the best movie in world . why it ranked with she's all that and notting hill not only are characters down to realistic , but they're hilarious ! brodie bruce my hero his sarcastic wit so perfect i laugh harder everytime see jay silent bob real american badasses their scemes just well worked out girls did not's forget t.s. recommend a big donut kudos cast mr jason lee you rock words cannot express love have of watch every day
amazingly original (i don't care if it was based on a true story) . by far the coen's best film acting turns steve buscemi , frances mcdormand and bill macy all sublime superb writing direction coens what other movie packs as much suspense social satire thrills hilarity into such tight package ? i can't think of one
kevin smith is just wonderful . the jersey triology awesome excitement , adventure jedi craves not these things.!! !
this is a fantastic movie but to me it more of drama with some comedy than true sidesplitting comedy.this features great cast relative unknowns at the time who all went on better things.this something cult unknown by masses . check out for evening entertainment
how could anyone not like this movie ? it's a buddy flick with an intelligent plot and cast of the finest up-and-coming actors that time . funny , touching well worth seeing
great ensemble cast and a bevy of rememberable lines . could you have named the colts unform's original colors
a terrific showcase for the awesome talents of johnny depp ! comedy isn't usually one's first thought , but his seamless presentation physical offsets gentle take on rather oddball misfit . watch it and enjoy
adam sandler rox
very funny adam sandler is great i loved that movie good mostly all the parts where .
the first time i saw this movie , thought it sucked . but like a fungus sorta grows on you adam sandler is not my favorite actor in film he just terrific kathy bates playing mama gives her usual great performance and highlight of henry winkler fondly remembered as fonz plays losing football coach whose luck turned around by sandlers waterboy plot basically predictable that okay with there should be sequell
sandler is like the funniest white man alive , at least (carlin move over) . soooo funny especially in this movie ! ?
i thought this movie was hilarious . read a lot of bad reviews and wasn't expecting much rolling on the floor i'm sports freak , so that probably is why liked it better than his other movies it's right up there with happy gilmore in my opinion
fairuza balk and adam sandler rule
as always with adam sandler's movies , this is a very funny movie . it's original and really enjoyable
hmm. . what can i say.. adam sandler...comedy movie with a great story.. amazing!!!! ! this is very good comedy for the whole family and sandler makes even better
very funny movie about a man who takes his job serious in being waterboy .
adam sandler is soooooo funny . one of sandler's best movies this movie kept me laughing the whole time and i never laugh during any other comedy
this movie is terrific ! i love the dark humor and nuances . characters are unique , quirky so memorable frances mcdormand fantastic as pregant sheriff one of most film characterizations in recent years turned me on to coen brothers while i've enjoyed their other films supreme achievement
he's the devil !
you can never go wrong with an adam sandler movie . guaranteed laughs
c'mon , it's adam sandler combined with football...what's not to like ?
water boy was hilarious - adam sandler's best
any movie that stars adam sandler is guaranteed to be absolutely histerical . his humore clever and original
adam sandler is hilarious !
this is a hilarious movie ! vince vaughn and ben stiller are riot in their roles , as well the hysterical supporting cast . when they have those classic hit-in-the-face shots they're actually funny definitely great summer age range : 13+ it's not necessarily inappropriate (though at times somewhat but often) some of humor would be hard for younger preteens to understand final grade
pure fun ! specially the dvd where we can watch favorite betty's soap opera .
this movie was excellent in portraying post-traumatic stress disorder . the performances were great and twist at end entertaining (with chris rock) dvd is with all extras commentary very helpful makes even better when you understand meanings behind everything
the coen brothers did it again . another great movie same sort of twisted humor is involved in this as previous movies , yet much different will keep you locked whole time
this is a funny movie . the nick dundee yet fits real typical stereotype of an australian it was how just as skillful in city his own way he bush only problem that if you think australians are all like and yobos , have another thing coming
fargo was a very original movie . i liked it so much because of its charismatic character (especially the lady sheriff) and weird turn events
i still laugh wen think about that girl crapping herself out the window on police car .
it was hilarious there to many funny parts think of but yeah very and good .
i like how varied the cast is in this film . rowan atkinson hilarious as a narcaleptic , cuba gooding jr funny with his 'lucy' counterparts and of course who can forget john lovitz hitler scene that made me laugh for twenty minutes entire works great together ! movie from beginning to end
i love this movie,it was so funny.it makes you wonder who would win the money,but no one did .
one of the funniest movies i have ever seen . didn't expect anything when first took my kids to see it and laughed so hard was crying (especially during hitler scene) is not an oscar winner by any means , but great for mindless relaxing comedy
very funny and enjoyable .
this movie is a black comedy that even though it was disturbing at some points , steve buscemi does and outstanding job . the accents in hilarious dialogue subtle yet comedic same time plot brilliant definitely amusing
mad funny! ! seth green and cuba gooding jr was priceless in this movie! too gr8
i loved this movie . went and saw it twice.the actors are great in some parts the whole audiance at theater was laughing for 5 minutes straight! ! love it!!
it's definitely not the funniest movie i've ever seen , but boy there are some scenes that just hilarious to unearthly levels . i think what makes this comedy a good one is its excellent cast from young experienced i'd probably have point out jon lovits and remarkable rowan atkinson as highlights in whoopi goldberg was ok her role didn't really funny parts it seems like producers of condition he would play mr.bean obviously typical material you're laughing at on wayne knight also did great job his character's personality very close character newman seinfeld which does best overall an entertaining family with
the funniest movie is recent years .
it was a very funny movie i thought didnt look good when seen the previews but cracking up .
sexy , smashing ausome !
funny .
frank the tank!! ! wow...i can't believe so many people have not liked this movie . of course it is about a bunch worthless middle aged men , but isn't that point comedy...laughing at abnormal situations only dumb are striving to be like guys in doesn't mean hilarious
will ferrell was very funny i liked it alot a movie .
fun to watch . black comedy with great acting it was kind of weird the way they talked movie based on a true story
an instant classic . i was in a fraternity college so can relate to the drinking , partying and taking advantage of girls this movie guys their early 30's are having sort mid-life crisis starting is escape from reality for them old school takes you throw some aspects pledging it hysterical
will ferrell was awesome in this film along with vince vaughn...it hilarious all the way through !
breathtaking and unrivaled till date . dark , creepy unmoving lifetaking well hello clarice ! hideous murderous cannibalistic hungry do you think i am evil ?
fargo is the funniest murder movie ever . i saw it in theaters three times and then bought right when came out that your partner woodchipper there ? frances mcdormand was hilarious
jimmy fallon + queen latifah = 1 funny movie
movie gold
i loved this movie . all the references to past movies and cameos made it really funny interesting for me
the final movie from jay and bob is an appropriate ending to their chuckleheaded adventures .
the coen brothers produced and directed this black comedy . twists in movie keep you on your toes odd story of a kidnapping north dakota is shocking at times , but always humorous entertaining
really only supremely funny for those people who have seen all of smith's movies . the asides and cameos make more sense however , this movie is still full moments even if plot so-so type where you see something new every time it plus ben affleck in he was *bomb* phantoms yo ! ;)
if you thought this movie was pointless and crude , then should withhold judging it untill see the other 4 movies in view askew universe . clerks first introduced us to jay silent bob there also chasing amy mallrats fourthfilm perhaps crudest rudest of all dogma bringing series its conclusion five are great as goes on courser funnier get watch expecting a film will be dissappointed go into like humor silly stuff you've hit motherload with one i really enjoyed
this movie is f**king hilarious . i am the clit commander!! !
this movie was hilarious ! i love jay and silent bob there a great cast of characters cameos will ferrell in it . one my favourite movies
kick ass movie
this movie is just so funny.kevin smith a good director . the only bad part chris rock
one of the funniest movies i've ever seen . period
how can you not like jay and silent bob . the best comedy duo since cheech chong reconize
the cohen brothers have triumphed again ! mcdermand and buscemi are wonderful . i probably would catagorized this with comedies
kevin smith is of course my favorite writer director . this was a great saying goodbye to the askewniverse it will be greatly missed society need someone who not afraid make fun both and himself only downside film for those haven't seen all others won't understand inside jokes
understated , clever and well-scripted . not what you'd call hilarious but very funny none the less
a very entertaining , clue type movie . hint : the butler didn't do it !
a great movie but not comedy .
a superb murder mystery that isn't ruined on second viewing . let me tell you how it ends.. very , well ! :)
ive seen all the scary movies and i thought 3rd one was best this funny as hell but have to admit that movie went downhill because they werent being completely serious with . even though a lot of people dumb those same still might go see 4th cause u never no what there gonna do in next cant wait until come out
oooooommmmmmmmmmmmggggggggg
had a alot of funny parts it was very movie .
yeah,i have this movie,it's a little scary and very funny the best type of movies ever made!^^ .
this movie was the best . extreamly funny! !
can you say funny ?
one of the funniest yet heartfelt films i've seen in a long time . keaton and nicholson are terrific !
this movie is f***in hilarious at first i thought wouldnt like it but bought and loved ill admit that has stupid humor its hard for most people to comrehend why funny love the part where well ferrel gets on stage starts playing one instrument carried away with even goes into ladies room continues play . if u weird strange suggest go see a must
i thought this movie was hilarious . anybody who is a fan of will ferrell's snl days really enjoy film
one of the best movies i ever saw . think it's so much as atmosphere that liked very funny , a lot memorable quotes like every movie should have and lovable characters (brick : would to extend you an invitation to...to pants party..) will ferrell fits ron burgundy perfectly it gave warm delight when surprise guests appeared (owen wilson vince vaughn ben stiller [como estan bietches?!]) 5 stars !
thoroughly enjoyed anchorman . will ferrell is on a hot streak old school and elf were good movies , but ferrell's portrayal of ron burgundy kept me in stitches throughout the flick movie did great job placing you 1970s (unlike awful that '70s show which has no clue what or humor is) it also captures soul san diego though some backdrops city recent vintage kind an anachronism love/hate/love relationship co/rival anchorwoman veronica corningstone (christina applegate looks great) riot real hilarious stuff occurs with burgundy's downright insane on-scene reporter sports guy weatherman fight scene between crew rival station news teams (watch for a-list cameos) was one funniest scenes ever staged dvd ton special features music video afternoon delight spit your food out funny
the best movie i ever saw , you stay classy san diego!!!! !
great movie -- i'm usually lukewarm about the coen brothers , but this really touched me . my favorite part was that cop's husband turned out to be designing stamps seemed at once humbe and noble
**update 8/10/04 : i just saw this movie again 2 nights ago . by the beard of zeus , it changed my life *oc if there was a vendor selling anchorman dvd for $75 pop in theater lobby would have picked up two on way out case lost one is top-five comedy quality an all-time list i'm not kidding it's right with likes naked gun airplane and caddyshack ron bergundy - jazz flutist great hair scotch-lover force to be reckoned
i love this movie almost as much ron burgandy loves scotch ! if you are into the 'zoolander' and 'old school' type of comedy , one is a must see my friends have already began to quote our favorite lines . although ferrell hit home with it was steve carrell who kept me laughing go get your tickets now!
i'm going to punch you in the ovaries . will ferrel is hilarious and this movie great it did feel slow at points , but was worth sit through those parts i don't think have ever laughed as hard a theater during big fight scene brick killed man
best ever but the commercial showed least funny parts so its great
artistic , stylish sexy - captivating view of the human race cohens did again!! !
whoes idea was it to put this film under comedies ? is no comedy . one of the most original and beautiful love stories i have ever seen on performances from every member cast (and mean member!) are stellar beyond expectation for such an eighties starring john cusack ( remember , crazy summer countless other shlock crap comedies) definatley a change pass who used as vehicle establish himself talented actor that he is.ione skye yea those films she in gave believable performance before vanished into obscurity light hearted yet moving romantic about high school graduate finally gets up nerves ask out girl his dreams hppens be over acheiving rich has very attached father we'll course sparks happen they fall conflict arrise resolved by end rest assured more entertaining than like glorybox mentioned say anything contains classic moments cinema history your eyes stero scene thousand times better cameron crowes three after watching once addictive heroin see trainspotting if you don't know what am talking highly recommended anyone with heart taste good romance
this is my favorite romantic comedy of all time-no one movies time . it's defiently cameron crowe's best about a guy named lloyd (john cusack , who absolutely wonderful in everyway.) falls for rich daddy's girl ione skye (who's name the movie seems to escape me at moment which rather embarrasing considering i was just sprouting praises oh well..diane ? that it dammit!) anyway beautiful story first love heartbreak loss innocense trust,-so many different elements and has most scenes ever be put if you've seen you know what i'm talking about-when holds up radio playing 'in your eyes'(my song.) girl--who's-name-i-can't-remember-dammit!- have big poster on ceiling scene with lyrics song..i like look before go sleep(corny shut up.) gives hope john out there somewhere boom box hand ready sweep away too emotion shown when they broke well empathistic (which isn't word,i know.) heartbreaking same very highly recommend see someone care because rateitall refuses soundrack will say good again recommended (look live version depeche mode's 'stripped'.)
great to watch , and it had a really good message
dreyfus at his best
one of my favorite bill murray movies , it's very funny and should be higher on the list .
one of my favorite comedy movies . what about bob features great dialogue , incredible acting from murray and dreyfuss a ending highly recommended !
another cute movie.... . that i absolutely love..... need say more ?
another movie with a very weak script . thank god they cast drew barrymore as the leading lady to save day.....she made this into classic already....a great comedy-romance that i enjoy watching on rainy afternoons...
this is my all-time favorite movie .
ok this was one of the best movies i have ever seen!the actors and actresses were great!the story romantic funny !
i liked this movie ! thought it was really funny guess depends on your type . and age is for the younger ones hehe
i thought this movie was sweet , funny and romantic ! just can't see why anyone wouldn't like it drew is hysterical as a nerd cool can be when she finally gets kissed
this was better then home alone 1 . kevin's pranks against the bad guys are more inventive , plus kevin is a bit older in movie which makes it
very funny .
i love these films....and culkin is so cool and sweet....a good young actor. . home alone
this movie surpassed the origional . i was quite impressed that it not just a remake of first one , as entire setting and atmosphere changed kevin mccallister's constant outsmarting harry marve hilarious even better than in
an excellent story about a pathetic individual . al pacino plays cuban better than any could have one of the best films 80's
i now realize it is a bit juvnenile , but the movie have probably seen most times in my life . can never watch through without cracking up at least 5 idea of 10-year-old kevin mccallister outsmarting everyone he encounters hilarious one favorite moments when manipulates his hotel room to sound like it's talking workers plaza schemes devises trick harry and marv are also extremely amusing overall an indescribably comical
one of the rare sequels that is better than original . a must see movie for any fan christmas or new york
forgive me , but i adore this movie . rented it really for lack of anything else that wanted to see plus thought looked kinda funny turned out be surprisingly adorable alright fine very unbelievable so what ? it's a not documentary and did fantastic job portraying high school life as is which many movies miss the mark on would consider chick flick with porn stars teenage love story yeah pretty much carbon copy risky business in heavy time remakes if there going one might well good
if one film could incapsulate the self-indulgence of eighties onto a single piece celluloid , it would be this . al pacino plays arguably greatest role his prestigious career in performance tony montana an ironic personification american dream is lowly criminal who comes to america from communist cuba with little more than shirt on back and gleam eye fueled by newly liberated sense desire he goes rags riches (dealing yayo naturally) doing so though becomes lax decadent obsessed money action packed tale vividly painted portrait double-edged sword that plentiful scenes are inventive lends infectious intensity them oh yes it's funny too pacino's portrayal exaggeratedly crude side-splitting as spouts language make howard stern wince scarface complete package true epic every minute infused vibrant creativity
you'd think that this movie was all sex if you saw the trailer for it , which is why i went to see but suprised me on a few levels . 1 has decent plot it's typical boy-likes-girl-then-girl-hates-boy-then-they-like-each-other-and-have-sex film had too 2 acting o.k it'd be bad wasn't other than worth renting
this is the best movie paul sisson has ever seen . klitz man !
ok i am weird , accept that . this show got my sides aching it was so hysterical still married husband inspite of his opinion movie not funny but stupid favorite
the mouse in bottle , iguess there will be no charge for this one
one of my favorite films , bob and doug mckenzie rule !
this was a highly intense but violent movie . it shouldnt have been surprise because rated x in the beginning cuz of violence its guy for sure ive watched few times
a terrifically cute throwback to the 60's sex comedies . ewan mcgregor and renee zellweger are utterly charming , both pulling in their usual great performances this film recreates era with such fun joy also worth noting is david hyde pierce's wildly funny supporting performance sets costumes hilarious jokes  terrific actors make genuinely lighthearted flick watching
it's a great film . especially based upon the 1960's! !
hilarious romp that is part homage/part parody of the amusing sex comedies early 1960s . great comedic peformances from all involved , a stylized appearance and jokes highlight this comedy
if only a girl could get by with out sex and cholcate.. .
i loved this movie , found out that me and al have so much in common not only cocaine but rented a tux for prom looked just like beach outfit he was wearing the first scene of .
hysterical ! i've watched it over and .
i have unconditional love for this movie .
what an enchanting movie ! just rented it last nite and am still humming i can't smile without you as well getting to know . if are a fan of kathy bates , will want hear her singing throughout this the end was especially poignant great julie andrews scream she constantly tried calm people down by one big tunes whole cast including rupert everett meredith easton were fantastic is must-see in my book
this movie is one of the best i've ever seen and i could watch it many times . kathy bates stars at an ordinary housewife , whose life centers on her family a fantasy she wants to be singer did you know has beautiful voice ? was shocked ! adores british played by jonathan pryce just as about get tickets see idol in person husband (dan aykroyd) gives news that he divorce film part musical mostly comedy mystery drama takes fox's death teach grace (kathy) how live : lived fear isn't much fun grace's love unusual because without demands accepted daughter-in-law who dwarf named only grandchild pokey never condemns still loves everyone quirky bizarre very funny eventually learns there more than being safe we are prompted end unconditionally our friends plus ourselves courage but makes work songs fabulous can't help keep singing them after over special guest cameo julie andrews another treat ; plays herself sings too other cameos like barry manilow lynn redgrave highly recommend go rent today!
utterly hilarious romp starring eddie murphy . lots of great gags from slapstick to star trek references ! no objectionable content whatsoever (its rated g in canada , pg by the us mpaa) and an upbeat optimistic tone is present highly recommended
great movie . eddie murphy and other daddy's were hilarious !
best anf funniest motha lovin' movie of the year 2000
owen luvs his mama
loved this movie ! also , the main character's name is malcolm and of guy i like(well sorta . amy you know what i'm talking about) which makes it even better
hilarious ! this has to be one of the funniest movies 2000 . martin lawrence can still make a seemingly tired old routine (a man in drag) into winner though laughs and jokes are somewhat crude , they'll leave you red with laughter so long as have sense humour storyline big momma's house isn't at all outlandish further adds appeal martin's comedic performance nia also does pretty good acting job here playing daughter who comes home momma not suspecting that it really is under up
lol ! i thought this movie was soo funny it much more realistic then the nutty professor . just really good
i laughed mu @$$ off !! ! it was hilarious!!
one of my favorite movies made by man . al pacino was as convincing in this movie the godfather i always tell truth even when lie , -al (tony monatana)
no one does it better than speilberg(plus i just felt like raising the rating.)
i could go on and raving about this masterpiece.one of the best movies ever made . will remain a class by itself for years to come
say hello to my little friend ! a coke goes long way , tony . hatter : okay so it was alot of
i chose this item because it was a fun movie that all family members should enjoy . comedy like is what the new age culture about
a classic . the last stand was great they couldn't drop him to numbah : uhmm , little coke ?
it is a very funny movie and keeps you on the edge at all times . characters played by cast are outstanding
this movie was funny throughout the time i sat down . it made me feel good after got out of theatre martin lawerence definitely makes you laugh
big momma's house was the perfect movie to keep you laughing throughout whole film . martin lawerence is an excellent actor
i was expecting to enjoy it , but loved this movie . absolutely hilarious start finish i'm pretty picky about the dvds buy because im broke and cheap is in my collection everyone film great
i was surprised by how funny this movie . it fits in with the whole american pie style comedies , plenty of jokes about sex and drug use two minority characters give a different twist though there is lot good racial humor going on
all a man has in this world is his balls and word , i don't break'em for no one . you got that?i even remember how many times i've quoted from movie since saw it about 10 years ago pacino's performance something else,it not acting,it's simply art it's most amazing form.definitely my top 5
this is without a doubt one of the funniest movies ever.........everything from doogie houser to white castle (obviously).......extremely crude so not for faint heart
this 1980s movie spoofs a whole lot of stuff . weird al was great back then the story revolves around him buying out crummy little television station and trying to hit it big on air things get off very slow start but his creative ideas boost station's success make you laugh it's
i think it was a great love story and loved the storyline .
this movie was so cool i seen it more than ones thats how .
if you go in viewing this movie as what it is , a harmless happy cinderella story then will find that enjoy great deal . i fell love with anne hathaway after seeing anyone who doesn't see more than few smiles has forgotten the joys accompany innocence
a lot of profanity and violence but it's classic . pacino is brillant comes across realistic drug-dealing gangster i want to add the extra's set my collection
loved it , julie andrews still as wonderful an actress/actor she ever was . hope they utilize this talented actress more
me scoozie , .
scotty doesn't know .
one of al pachino's best roles . absolutely wonderful! !
they dont make thes kind of movies fo fa@s like ctvf47 .
i'm sorry if the majority of teens today enjoy raunchy humor(sarcasm) . sure people will stop making these movies when watching them
chappelle . ok ?
even if you don't smoke pot this movie is hysterical . yeah man. funions. hee
a great classic about an immigrant drug dealer who works his way up to the top by being aggressive and not letting anyone get in . but it is this attitude which leads downfall - he will listen even closest friends becomes extremely self-consumed careless , high coke intake doesn't help end invincible tony mantana falls as quickly had risen
a great movie from the late nineties about smoking pot...chapelle is man for here and today !
i love this movie . its funny , helps me cheer up on bad days david chapelle rocks it didnt take itself too seriously and is easy to enjoy
this was hilarious to anybody who has experienced fundamentalist youth culture first hand !
this is the # 4 best movie ever on my list . mandy moore classic as hilary faye ! she understands character and very funny (satirically) i can't stand people like those in , satires it perfectly
not too great of a comedy imo , but it has some messages about religion homosexuality and fitting in . i give 5 stars because am christian was offended got me thinking which is more than can say any other movie i've seen my life
ok i really loved this movie saw it twice in the theatre...i recommend to everyone ! you know dont like people that take jokes personally...hello their called for a reason . and they embraced everything with gay community because have relative thought was so beautiful...go see has wonderful message send..
warning : not for young audiences ; may be offensive to some due content . anyway this movie is about a girl named mary and her senior year in christian high school she loves life , has the perfect friends boyfriend  at least thinks so until he tells i think i'm gay ouch goes through drastic measures try save him suddenly realizes how imperfect really does go into lot of issues which considered but it passes very strong messages tolerance understanding true friendship extremely funny
i know , many jim carrey fans out there are angry about this film because of the dirty stuff but after watching like south park and especially man show i'm used to by now welcome side-splitter with open arms . just brilliant comedy besides really gross parts
i don't know why , but loved this movie . think have ever laughed so hard the part when he is running after train and his nose wheezing most people didn't like it was good
this film is only for jim carrey . who could play role charlie/hank except ? the hard words were just cute...renee zellweger was cute too irene p waters very different image prepared to that in jerry maguire she showed even keep up with her charm enough attract his instinct..
jim carry and renee zellweger are such a power team ! they great together
funniest jim carrey movie yet ! he plays the jekyll/hyde role perfectly scene when first morphs from charlie to hank is one of most hilarious acts physical comedy ever
raw , brutal real . if you think that the chainsaw scene is hollywood again one of my all time favorite flicks
this is one of the most funniest movies i have ever seen!!!! ! dont think that it would be as funny if someone else other than jim carey was playing part charlie/hank . he adds vibe to movie a great hilarious recomend anyone who wants good laugh or has sense humor
one of the best 90s . it definitely deserved all oscars got great film
classic movie. . dont know what to say about it but was very entertaining and the performances were wonderful
jim carrey is one of the funniest men alive . i was laughing constantly thoughout whole movie you know he a good actor because different characters played
this movie was very funny and jim carrey a character . had life because he to take care of his stepkids that did not even belong him split personality
this movie was hella funny and i liked the humor of jim carrey .
funny movie . it was hilarious jim carrey's humor and goofiness make the great
here's your chance to see pacino with his face in a pile of coke . this movie is great
the funniest movie of year . i'm a great jim carrey fan and once again he gave us laughs
although i hate jim carrey , found myself doubled over with laughter throughout the whole movie .
i thought that this was one of the funniest movies i've seen in a while . most my friends didn't like it but , guess because jim carrey kept me laughing whole time watching
i thought this movie was very funny . parts liked : white guy with black sons who were ghetto geniuses , the name of his condition invincible cow jim carrey's physical comedy
my faverout movie of all time , i'll say that first . released to a hail critisism in fact they gave it an x rating virtualy unheard outside the world hardcore pornography lol scarface its boasted record amount swears making use f word almost 200 times but this film is worth more than dated shock value operatic and overblown apeals anyone looking for with minamum arsing around - no love sceans attempt bring shade or depth montana's character he defined by his actions as pure bad guy ultimate anti-hero icon endlessly watchable quotable you'll either you r face vilolence agression hate bloatedness linear simplicity about one scumbags rise fall alot coke carnage !
always loved jim carrey movies . this movie was hilarious when the cop had chicken stuck in his ass , i rolling on floor great
funniest movie i've seen this year . jim carey was hilarious i would see a hundred times
this movie was hilarious . jim carey and renee zelweger are a great pair the had chemistry that made ten times funnier one liners background scenes just add to humor definite must see 
great movie . jim carrey's funniest he deserves an oscar nomination
really funny the whole way through . jim carrey puts on a great performance your stomach will hurt from laughing have good time
for what it was great . a raw , raunchy comedy hardcore fans and also teenage boys carrey turns in another performance rene zelweger gorgeous funny movie with your friends
best movie eva!!!aint it just like that game grand theft auto vice city?? ?
this movie was very funny and well worth your time to see . shows what a versitale actor jim carey is he has many memorable lines
this is so funny . for a big laugh i would go to see great first date !
hilarious ! this movie continued solid with comedy throughout , and never had a bland spot . it was laugh out loud funny the plot non-existent but still great
excellent movie . jim carey returns to his old self this is comparable dumb and dumber instead of over relying on jim's physical comedy aspect , (ace ventura 2 cable guy) an interesting plot was incorporated as well
al pacino is a god ! the cussing was little excessive but i like way they talk normal people . last scene made movie
*hahahahaha*
it was very funny and i liked mike myers is .
in my opinion , the greatest movie ever made . al pacino gives yet another great memorable performance and i think that ending was genius enough said
the best i was literly laughing through whole movie . some of you people gotta lighten up
i loved this movie , it was the best of 3 though . so funny watched with my whole family and we all laughed but 9 year old brother didn't get some
grat move to just have a laugh
i really enjoyed this film - even saw it twice at the cinema . yes , you could regard as lame and just same other two but found hilarious michael caine was fantastic liked scenes where austin powers doctor evil were school with basil people relax ! its a silly movie for to have giggle
this movie was really funny it better then the first and second .
de palma's direction can never grow stale : it's the visual definition in my opinion of panoramic , a real tribute to this vaguest remakes . oliver stone on other hand i think has rather definite tendency date himself don't know if you blame him for cheesy music but story is very much stuck its era drug-built decadence and superficiality political cowardice fortunately pacino's scarface be dated he's guy with his own tweaked sense right wrong ; murderer who won't let anybody sister criminal values loyalty honesty above all like great characters he tragic flaw without giving anything away that same courage puts top empire alienates from kings underworld fatal degree strength film character tony montana so smooth action overwhelming mindblowing mood often dark disturbed easy get distracted kid no options becoming crook world everything it may reusable theme one will ever do as well pacino palma because else could find psychological depth they did title mask such beautiful carnage love even though vicious monster movie
even thinking about this movie makes me chuckle . i just spontaneously start giggling when think those characters yes , the is way too crude and raunchy for my tastes but creativity of eddie murphy's up that not shakespeare so it's subtlety script i'm interested in okay truth is.. fast forward through dumb parts  good are really
when i say this movie in theatres was crying because of eddie murphy's hilarious characters and phrases . loved , a 10 is what deserves
it was good , but not as the 1st nutty professer . go see if you want a laugh though !
eddie murphy is hilarious , the movie was all in very funny and took comedy to next level .
although this was based mostly on potty mouth comedy , it entertaining . i like the way eddie murphy plays his different family members
i found the nutty professor ii to be very funny . think it was better than first one eddie murphy is hilarious and janet jackson gorgeous
the movie scarface with al pacino is an american classic filled action and suspense . this definitely my favorite of all time from cuban refugee to multi-millionaire , best tale rise gutter hi-rise
another outstanding comedy from eddie murphy . i laughed throughout the whole thing usually don't watch a movie with smile , but it is impossible to not while watching this isn't as funny first one still gets 5
i lauged all the way through this movie . characters , story and eddie made a must see for me because of klumps have watched my first nutty professor over can't wait next one
eddie murphy is still great . impersonator makeup makes me laugh just with ad lib all about the dialogue
the best movie of summer . eddie murphy deserves an oscar , he plays 5 characters each completely different from other and brings warmth to a must see
truly one of the best horror movies all time .
great movie for its time . quotes thrown out al is the best i watched it everyday one summer a good gangster , especially after godfathers
great movie ! it kept you laughing throughout the whole .
very funny jack black is hilarious .
this movie is one of the best comedies out today . jack black funniest actors there
funniest new movie i've seen , really nothing funnier out right now . i specifically love the scene where jack black grabs nacho just like me and my bros
that was really funny ! i love richard 4 lyf!!!!
kate hudson is very funny i liked it really thought was .
this movie is an all time classic . pacino ! the was full of action , a great story and characters i have seen good nine times not once has it been boring thumbs up
i'm so excited because i am the one giving first opinion for this movie!...well you can tell liked movie..in fact loved it..it was very funny and more of a chick flick most guys wouldn't understand ! but advise to go see it
great ! jennefer garner shines
this movie was very cute and i loved it . love the 80s music they put in like jesse's girl is a battlefeild
this was such a great movie ! i loved it . sweet and kind of relates to how girls act when they are young will do anything be popular but in , proves that bening isn't the best thing you can have should stick with your true friends showed message if haven't seen is definite go see
the best gangster movie ever . every since has paled in comparison al pacino was excellent he played his part as if a real life mobster i really like realism and drama
my favorite gangsta' movie of all time is scarface . it's a timeless scrutiny the mafia life if you like mob this for
the cave part aws best!! !
soooo funny...i still cant get over that they had to cuddle in cave !
the movie scarface is one of my all time favorite movies . it has a little bit everything within such as romance , friendship suspense and especially violence i really enjoy violent fits that criteria shows how drugs drug dealing are major part american culture
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww !
stupid crude disgusting adolescent humor . i give it 5-stars
scarface . a classic one of the best original gangsta movies all time i can never get tired seeing it over and again
this movie was way too funny.rob rules .
almost everyone has seen this movie . it is a legend was dramatic and suspenseful
funny !
i enjoyed it  , was very funny kept you going all doing the show and had good actors ms . d
i thought this movie was soooo funny ! cant like explain myself why liked it but its a must-see so just watch and see for yourself .
the movie was very real . it an excellent portrayal of gang and drug life nas also makes references to in his songs
this movie is very funny , from the beginning to end . i saw twice and it still was second time humor mostly bathroom basically stuff that grosses you out all actors/actresses were especially deuce's 'customers'
an excellent psychological thriller with fantastic acting .
thi is one of my favorite movies . i like the pacino , and way he acts seems so real really story how went from a nobody to big man it ends
very cute i loved it
a very good remake of series , scooby-doo has talented cast with variable script . some the jokes including references to television are great while fart can be left at door also cameos from other characters and surprise ending make it five-star deleted scenes on dvd however were should have been in !
zoiks... .
scooby-oo rocked . sarah and fredie were great matt lillard was wonderfully funny
now me i have never liked the cartoon show that is out on tv but went to see this movie my best friends birthday and thought it was an awesome . think only little flaw in at end when turned be scrappy doo bad guy he should not been
hey everyone ! well , despite what oodie had to say i think that scooby doo was great and the kids in audience were laughing quite histerically at movie. . along with adults no kid would rather museum over doo.. haven't watched show a long time go movies see it like seeing cartoon characters real life actors partrayed these roles mean matthew lillard.. never too big of fan his but this role he hilarious! remember one part where said something found myself for 20 minutes ahahaha. se movie again just part. haha okay anyways. freddie prince jr whoa baby! even blonde hair is sexy papa hilarious too. as all actors. sarah michelle gellar her lot. she adorable little purple dress wore nehoo! woman who playes thelma i'm taking up much space so gonna if anyone mood funny lil then suggest :)
al pacino is one of my favorite actors . that movie has some the best action for an early 80's picture character tony montana was brilliant
his private life aside(no pun intended) this film was pretty good and funny.i thought saturday morning show funny too .
i thought it was funny .
could be one of the best movies all time . it has everything , good story line and it's an adventure you won't forget
one of the most hilarious movies 80's  ! i have only had chance to see it twice , but someday will take time rent again or maybe even buy . is well worth money thought this movie was done in great taste and pee wee seemed so naive innocent thru out whole big adventure like other reviewers on website there are many scenes lines that could never be forgotten they memorable always hoped would a part 2 particular guess best leave enough alone case were plans for second until fun with willy ? who knows certainly don't think should condemned enjoying masturbation as natural he kept bedroom sure bee said isn't hollywood does these kinds things just didn't get away
scarface is a classic . this has to be the all time best movie in history ending was tight it would have been better if he blasted everyone though
this is an absolute classic .
this movie is , dare i say brilliant . bitingly funny and alot of black humor at that film ludicrous completley off in a universe all it's own tim burton added nothing but genious to you cannot help laugh from beginning end yet another helped shape me into the weirdo am today don't hate because paul reubins it he was busted for churning butter an adult theater one hell guy highly recommended! ! when get there tell em large marge sent ya
this movie was co-written with the late , great phil hartman . if you take it as a slapstick or other moron-oriented type of comedy will disappoint but look at saga (hang on) and let it's funny moments become incidental i promise recognize that is one funniest movies have ever seen geniuses like daresay paul rubens don't feel pressure to entertain their punchlines are more subtly interwoven in scripts rewardingly harvested words characters can be jokes where comedies dumb phrases carry burden entertaining audience find hard believe everybody on earth hasn't already haven't recommend whole-heartedly best i've
this movie may be rated pg , but the humor is definitely not geared toward children . of course neither was pee wee s playhouse for most part one creative quirky and unique films ever made big adventure remains hilarious after 16 years many lines are burned in my memory only from having watched film times also because were so widely imitated at time well into early 90 it strange how some people seemed to forget funny much they enjoyed ruebens caught attempting cause himself go blind that florida theater hugh grant wasn t really doing better than once upon a boost his popularity hmmmmm i have no plans marry either them guess m still free enjoy their work
i loved this movie ever since was a kid . my bike too so could relate to pee-wee
say hello to my little friend . if you don't know where that came from are not this planet whether hated the movie or loved it tony montana(al pacino) made everybody want be scarface has all ; action , drama and american dream a true masterpiece
this is among my favorite movies of all time . it has a ton quotable lines , and maybe the only tim burton movie where there's personality at its center that overshadows odd universe created by director pee wee (there's things about me you wouldn't understand.. couldn't shouldn't understand) his best in francis dottie speck amazing larry they rule (btw biggest laugh i ever got out mystery science theater episode came recently when someone quoted using deep voice paging mr herman from movie-within-the-movie near end.)
this movie is hysterical . best scene : pee-wee patiently waiting through a tedious tour of the alamo , hoping to find his bicycle in non-existent basement
laugh out loud funny . i'll never forget the guacamole treaty of 1917 falk and arkin really clicked i just about totally lost it when billy or bing , don't remeber which explained use life vest in chinese
the in-laws is a classic . peter falk and alan arkin are hilarious together just thinking of word serpentine makes me laugh
tony montana is played by al pacino . a great gangster movie of all time killing people , drug abuse etc
this is the life story of howard stern . it also one very funny movie for those us who like , interesting to see how he worked his way up from obscurity become king all media you do not may give some insight into unique brand humour great music throught an added bonous
very sweet movie predictable but nice and a blend of fairytail comedy mostly .
seems so real . i wish was scarface making money
this movie was great ! a flick for teens
i luved the movie.it was a bit like princesses dairies but more touching and balivable even cried im not type who cries in movie .i loved ending it real touching.i suggest you all see it.it just reminds that whereever go youll still be yourself
this is a wonderful movie! !
this movie is touching and terrific
a 3 hour long pacino saga that never gets old .
funny movie , you gotta love jack black
scarface is a classic that will never die . it the father of drug dealer movies
stab my foot with that pitchfork...ow , didn't hurt...haha
my best film of all time adam sandler is one the actors i have ever seen without him this would been nothing.and dont care if any says dosent deserve hipe it got it's still
scarface is a classic . it will always be great movie , no matter how many times i watch
i loved this movie because the plot makes sence , deniro and crystal are hilarious has very,very funny parts .
what a great cast ! it's to enjoy well-written and well-acted comedy . lisa kudrow shows that she performs as well in full-length movies on friends deniro billy crystal play off of each other beautifully
anthony hopkins did a great job as he always does . this is one of my favorite movies and i would highly recommend you to see it if havent already
say hello to my little friend .
awesome movie!! ! all teens have gotta see it
i loved this book as a child and so was thrilled when found out they were remaking film . it didn't disappoint at all steve martin bonnie hunt are their best , hilarious loving in toned down sort of way the actors surprisingly good distinct that you felt like knew twelve is one family films i've seen while wholesome heart-warming does suffer few slapstick messy jokes but just makes kids happy definitely recommend for whole
hysterical and cute !
gets a little draggy at the end but still great adventure sean connery film . generally anything with sam neill,scott glenn and would be worth watch baldwin appears to sleep-walking
loved this movie ! steve martin is always great and kathleen turner was excellent , too . very funny lines story
the people who dont get this movie are usually napoleon of their home town .
my favorite thing that he says is frickin idot
great adaptation of the novel . packed in thick , end-to-end best line movie : "ryan some things here don't react too well to bullets yeah me i bullets." for those into submarines this one ranks right up there with crimson tide and das boot (if you use subtitles not dubbed version)
i loved this movie,you friggin idiots !
say what you want , but jon heder's 'napoleon dynamite' is very funny . makes this movie so successful isn't much the interaction of seemingly cartoonish characters more fact that perennial underdogs ought to prevail despite circumstances should overwhelm them and it doesn't hurt picture spliced with unforgettable supporting like uncle rico pedro who feed about humor throughout film all these make for a hilarious comedy which will bring loads laughs movie-goers
i loved it so much!! ! am counting down the days until dvd comes out in december!! woo hoo , you all go and buy ok ? give up for napoleon pedro...i wish he was on election ballot woner how many people would have voted him? haha .
the best movie ever besides forrest gump ! i loved it . although it's not for everyone , people who enjoy comedy like monty python and garden state will love go tina llama
with a dearth of family movies out this summer , we took gamble and our kids (ages 8 10) to it . though was pg there nothing really objectionable other than they said the word crap now then movie kind dead-panned revenge nerds meets judy blume set in an idaho high school surprisingly funny (my wife extreme stitiches) napoleon (played brilliantly by jon heder) hilarious fact each character is delightfully absurd their own way i got kick dietrich bader (otto from drew carey show) ; he my favorite as wacko sensei rex who taught lost martial art kwon do find most indie films pretentious overhyped not so dynamite it's excellent film
one of the better independent films . i couldn't stop laughing first time saw it , and for no reason ! second was just as great think only some will appreciate slow smart humor
best movie i ever saw funny as hell you must see it
this was a wonderful movie . i saw it with my 15 yr old daughter and couldn't stop laughing ! the characters are is very refreshing without usual violence gratuitous sex scenes teenagers will love , at least mine did may go see again hear missed something when left during end credits even from opening so creative fun
good characters , story and at least one catchphrase that i catch myself using . (write down)
this film was very funny ! although it descusting in parts wich made that little bit funnier because everyone is like 'ewwwwww' i rented on dvd and im now tempted to buy
love this movie !
animal house for the 90's
great movie . it was amazingly funny , but once again might upset those who dont like sexual humor or arent in the targeted highschool to college age groups
cute !
the wedding planner was one of best movies that i have seen in while . it full good clean humor it's a movie you can watch with anyone.. give two thumbs up !
a real romantic comedy...that's why i liked it so much . it's sweet , adorable and light afterwards didn't regret taking along my 6 year old husband too except for the little white lies that main characters tell one more thing bothered him : fact very easily convinced to see this chick-flick not only once but twice he better second time ! same as did
the best . very hilarious nice light comedy , not vulgar there was always something going on to keep my attention i've seen it 3 times ! hoping go 4 more!!! see or will you miss out!!
ohhhhh my gosh ! this was such a great movie jennifer lopez really good in it . romantic , yet funny if you haven't seen do now! sooooo
i loved this movie ! it was sooooo sweet , just in time for valentine's day saw on sunday and would gladly see again . bought the soundtrack rocks too is so cool
i loved this movie . watched it with some of my friends and we all liked a lot laughed cried kept us on our toes throughout real must-see !
awesome movie..must see
i thought the wedding planner was a delightful movie . it accomplished what set out to do ; made me feel good my friends thoroughly enjoyed our time at this
a sweet romantic comedy that uses wit and humour to create universally appealing film . not sappy chick flick , truly funny
jennifer lopez and matthew mcconaughey light up the screen in this delightful movie . wedding planner is a fun-loving romantic comedy that's great for all audiences has sense of style she brings it to full force plays mary did wonderful job her first comedic performance very charming so funny he such playing steve these two were perfectly cast i've already seen twice still can't get off my mind i definitely will be buying one when it's on dvd or vhs go out see promise you won't regret it! !
the wedding planner was best movie that i have seen in a really long time ! jennifer lopez is fantastic actress this . matthew mcconaughey also great actor romantic comedy and it made me laugh cry if you are thinking not chick flick , you're wrong because watched with my boyfriend who loved think about own relationship helped so having problems your suggest take to see am sure everything will be fine after could over again can't wait until comes out on vhs can buy instead of watching super bowl sunday went something never regret go it!!
when i saw this movie the first time was disappointed . it seemed just too stupid to me up watching second thought really funny accepted for what , humor and now it's one of my favorite movies damn that hansel ! he's so hot right
ben stiller's best movie i think , like it because is so stupid and relly makes fun of the fashion industry which in itself a big joke . there are lot celebrity cameos as well its funny guy has same face for every single modelling shoot then he been working on years also pose! ! entire family works film (wife dad mom) had to have laughed way through time watch
so funny!! ! stiller and owen wilson are incredibly funny . i wouldn't give the movie a chance because heard it was about male modeling , but after stumbled into just couldn't stop watching anyone can die in freak gasoline fight accident
a true cold war classic ! sean connery shines , alec is ok even sam neill had good role . me being in the navy i to be partial this movie as it keeps you on edge of your seat
love this movie hilarious and funny it one of my favorite movies !
a great movie . one i can turn on and enjoy watching anytime
i must admit that am a fan of the original and did think second could not be as good , but they pulled it off very successfully . i've read other comments on this movie find if anyone had watched would absolutely love you hated its sex jokes don't watch one howeverm with crazy antics jim his pals get up to will leave laughing so hard even has cheesy sentiment about (for romantic types) all actors pull their performances wit consistency is film enjoyed by any teenager just take (what person noted - 'mocking' modern teenagers) seriously it's in fun make laugh over again
this was even funnier than the first one , and a blast .
ok , i loved the humor in this one better than first and its totally more insane.. . but think they play finch wayyy too much he can only be funny to a limit also not enough vicky jessica.. dont even had role seann william scott jason biggs alyson hannigan pooled movie off nicely
hilarious.....this is a masterpiece of comedy.....loved the first movie....and loved second
i enjoyed this sequal very much . it was just as good the first bit dubious about sequel but done really well.it helped haveing all original people in film could jump straight into story.very funny jokes and heart warming at end things were tied a must see !
just as good 1 - one of the only sequel besides godfather and alien to have such a strong . hilarious
i enjoyed american pie 2 . the sequel to this teenage comedy , seemed have more heart than first one where everything was about teenagers and their wild adventures don't get me wrong had same expected humour impact but a bit sensitive if you thought got know characters really well in previous movie actually goes deeper into true feelings exhibits emotions at better level conclusive by end of film that provided close all relationships therefore making it very hard for next overall pretty satisfied even surprised with outcome since much lower expectations from
terri and steve rule
an instant classic !
the original amercan pie . laugh out loud hilarity
finally , a movie with thought . it's use of suspense and intrigue made this film one my all time favorites there is also the fact that i didn't have to sit through 2 hours blood sex bad language
haven't seen this movie in years but i do remember laughing my butt off .
this is a fun movie throughout that i can watch over and . too bad the sequels were all so horrible
this movie is a classic . i am fan of all the porky's movies
hillarious !
i really enjoyed this movie . it attracted me because my dad is a submariner he said was very realistic dramatic and there never dull moment
all about three men getting involved with a baby that was left on their steps . they get very attached despite being wild bachelors
excellent,excellent,excellent movie!! ! sean connery in one of his absolute finest performances . this definitely is the best submarine battle movies ever made
loved ittttt!!!! !
this is an absolutely brilliant film adaptation of novel . in my opinion the best action movie ever made
my favorite movie of all time : richard pryor , george carlin bill duke antonio huggy bear fargus (what a cast!) . killer sound track by rose royce the pointer sisters c'mon dog what's not to like about this movie! ?
excellent movie . great original story and well acted something different from your typical hollywood
funny , original - about a girl who decides to try out being gay for while ! asks the question differences between love couple and best friends is this film line platonic sexual moved
i loved this movie , cute and funny . ashley judd & hugh jackman had great chemistry..
it was a good movie because of the great acting sean connery and alec baldwin , with nice plot .
great movie. .
this movie was so cute . i cried at the end once again , hugh jackman's talent shines like brightest star in sky ashley judd is such a good actress go see as soon you can it one of best made yet

i could actually picture cops doing stuff like that on their downtime . the feud between highway and state was good for laughs as far movie itself goes wouldn't call it useless because entertained me everyone have shared with
you better run cause big john rambo is on the loose and pissed of at that hick town damn sheriff . watch out has his own war he didnt draw first blood this an excellent outdoor film makes thirsty for revenge stallone should have won oscar , best movie year as well "he drew blood!!!"
if you like the subtle absurdities of rushmore and royal tenenbaums , bottle rocket is a must see . this before other two best captures andersons style it had me laughing my arse off then again you're not fan wes anderson or wilson brothers may just find boring definitely worth renting though
i love it own on dvd . catherine zeta-jones is amazing and soooo beautiful
loved the characters , actors and thought it was extremely funny . it's kind of way i think real hollywood is made me laugh
this is the best stallone movie ! one of action movies ever , amazing story also you better go rent at blockbuster before its gone .
well...i just went to go see this movie today and i must say is histerical!! ! it a see...the about america's most loved couple breaking ^ the people not liking them as much b/c they are together.then someone has been hired try bring back together , but brings surprises great entertainment so c it! actors actresses in follows : julia roberts billy christal john cusack catherine zeta jones...oh adorable seth green toooooo!!!!catherine jones famous that split ^...and sister of man get chrystal's assistant....it very cute! did yall know was offered part gwen jones' . oh if u have seen or previews parts w/ dogs by christal's crotch...wasn't suppose ta be movie....and my opinion funniest part..heheehe sooo hvae it..i highly recommend it!!  )
funny . oh , i forgot...funny ! thought the cinema would have crumpled down because of big laughs in crowd
this was awesome ! i loved the scene with burning.. . well watch and find out
hysterical ! very funny and witty . the cast was terrific writers knew how to make people laugh
every movie with david spade is a very funny i loved it was great and plus brittany daniels so hot .
there haven't been hardly any funny movies out in the last few years , but this one is hilarious . and i didn't think david spade could be without chris farley...boy was wrong definitely a must-see
east or west sylvester stallone is the best
an all right film , and kidman saves it from being a dud .
underrated terribly . totally hilarious
hysterical!! ! so cute loved it .
the best of rambo series , and most believable . this is stallones movie since rocky
probably one of my favorite movies .
ok , i wouldn't give it five stars except that i'm comparing to a lot of new comedy releases . anyway this movie was hilarious actually think about sweet old lady driving seemingly normal couple such extremes even makes me laugh now haven't had so many out loud moments watching comedic in years it's must see
stallone's finest hour .
again , it's not really a comedy . but great fable about modern politics - specifically the beauty and depravity of human nature amplified through tempest as dark film seems its mixed motives tension between idealism cynicism romance realism principle pragmatism billed slam clintons actually portrayals are very humanizing in that there fact strong core values obscured by hypocrisy corruption i came away liking more emma thompson was usual just dazzling her versatility travolta impressed me despite stereotypical depiction forgot looking at whereas im usually annoyed with him half way because he normally inserts too much his own personality into characters supporting cast superb right down to minor one or two lines
best movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
this movie was hilarious with a nice plot off of the first . it could've had little bit more action , but already in sufficient enough to keep most from complaining sandra bullock priceless !
great movie , i still laugh every time watch it . help plan http://www.montrealvip.com/bachelor.htm wild bachelor parties for a living and this has been insperation have even seen guys bring the moive to durring their bp i'm trying find doneky but its hard in downtown montreal :)
this was hilarious ! dreyfus at his best .
i remember when this first came out and there was nothing but rave reviews . still think it a great movie the best stallone has ever done
thatv was so00o funny ! especially wit chris rock in it he's da bomb! i love richard 4 lyf!!!
this movie was hilarious ! it wasn't the funniest of all time or anything , but is definately worth seeing.great entertainment
i seen this movie last weekend , and it was so funny chris rock is hillarious . when he the old man you will like cause sure did
c`mon , reality bites is a really good movie and if you dont like it just watch for ethan hawke ! its one of my fave movies .
hilarious stifler at his best if he wasent in there the movie wouldnt be funny all i really liked it .
i just seen this movie for the first time last night and.. . woohoo!! ! am very glad they made installment of american pie as funny original when stifler (scott) has to eat that dog sh*t , about pissed in my pants
one of the best movies i have ever seen . anthony hopkins did a fantastic job along with jody foster
one of stallones best films behind the rocky
my favourite film of 2001 . i know this is a very personal rating...but loved it : the plot , script characters acting fell in love instantly
this story has a moral to it , sf veterans should not be messed around with . sly was awesome and the town got totally f'd up that sherif prick trautmans uniform all wrong but oh well i didnt catch fist few times
wife made me watch it with her . i confess , liked paltrow did a nice job acting the part of an average iq person determined to rise from ranks low-class upbringing struggle and how she ended up as pilot maybe because have two daughers beautiful can appreciate film that encourages women girls accomplish high standards behave ethically need this kind role model says it's girl power movie thought was great !
connie and carla was great ! a lot of new movies , trends music etc are all becoming some what the same . this movie sensation something that actually you must go out see you'd be missing aren't bored almost every having actors plot climax ?
haven't seen it yet but sounds awesome ! a little like bring on i loved that movie
i luv this movie . it is really awesome just like bring on !
a bunch of stupid , hot high school cheerleaders running around in their panties and bras? ! you cant lose
that was a great movie ! especially wit freddy prinze jr . in it now he's hot'n'sexy mama i love richard 4 lyf!!!
norm macdonald is hilarious with artie lange
this is among the most underrated comedies of all time . was a lol riot way through when they're not too busy partying off camera , norm macdonald and ardie lange can be comedic geniuses (snl madtv howard stern show) once you get to bar scene laughter never ends
very underappreciated comedy of the '90's . norm macdonalad is superb
a rarity for sly (imho) this is geat movie . it has two realistic characters : down and out viet nam war vet gets bad news small town sheriff that uses shady means to keep his clear of vagrants when the clash , viewer sees capabilies both
the funniest spoof movie i have ever seen...all those retarded teen movies finally got what wasa coming to them !
this was the funniest movie ever made . it more than accomplished what set out to do - incorporate a plot element from every teen , embellish and then spoof even voices in background signs on walls have jokes guy with slow clap guy's sister coming him main character's prize-winning paintings turning be drawings that preschooler would draw too much !
trey and matt have struck gold once again . now don't go into this one expecting shakespeare or clean , wholesome otherwise safe family entertainment (yeah you know who are) never in my life i laughed so hard a theatre nor ever been to movie that got such an overwhelming reaction of chestpain-inducing laughter from everyone attendance the audience was it at difficult hear dialogue times parker stone are right on money their criticisms all sides war terror : everything kneejerk patriotism hollywood's delusions they can change world with acting how rest gets caught crossfire representation sean penn's iraq visit reminiscence is spot just like south park work far more intelligent than meets eye further perfected formula taking relatively serious issue hitting dash clever political commentary then giving generous ladling tacky sauce works every time peons can't see past bathroom humor get meat what these guys trying say should back american idols bachelors apprentices
gigantic artistic effort . wonderful satire of the hollywood 'activists' & has a sing-along soundtrack as good 'south park : bigger , longer uncut.' can't wait for dvd one caveat  if u love cannibalistic deranged torturers who run north korea maybe it is not
this movie is great , it gave sylvester stallone his first break to be a shooting star . also gets into the controversial idea of sacrificing your life for country but all system does shaft you in return
hilarious . not many comedys are anything like this if your in the mood for a good laugh with something different then watch it somehow i wish they would hurry up that sequel
although not up to par of tv's frasier or i love lucy the cinematic genius toy story 2 airplane !  , it is certainly a funny movie that easily enjoyable . sight gags word puns product placement modern references and sound effects round out great plot with hilarious ending sequel really in planning stages let's hope evil betty doesn't team moon-you again..
the one that started it all . leaves you with a sense of unfinished business stallone is crazy and you'll know why if see this
john goodman at his best
that was probably the funniest movie i ever saw .
was pleasnatly surprised how the movie turned out! ! very entertained and thought it david spades best so far
this movie is so great . the scenes between lecter and clarice are intense , you can actually feel it some will be turned off by subject matter but ones who stay with not disappointed i don't want to give too much away
most of these pieces were brilliant and hilarious , although i started to feel wired just watching the characters down coffee !
this movie was hilarious to anybody who's been involved with environmental politics at the grassroots level . probably humor is too inside for many people appreciate , and perhaps a little dark dry i personally couldn't stop laughing from opening scene very last lines : "should bring my own chains?" "we always do." hoffman lilly thomlin made an incredible team as "existential detectives." guess you just had be "there."
incredible ! may have even bumbped fight clug from my top fave spot . i'll to see the back , once i get huckabees dvd highly recommend love music by jon brion as well perfect for movie
i hope they will make a 3 . eddy murphy was terrific , as well the animals even went out and bought movie
i thought this movie was very good , it hilarious . frankie muniz and mandy moore did the voice of two bear cubs eddie murphy a great job had little surprise that you have to think about for minute before registers what happened if go see will know i'm talking
do remember that when the film was originally made , most people would have missed innuendo unlike todays generation . still took some guts to get past mpaa censors a wonderful for bond fanatic enjoy probably connery's finest as 007
i loved this movie
any film where the makers had balls to name a villainess "pussy galore" deserves 5 stars on principle !
love it !
under-rated film that is destined to earn a cult following in the future .
i am in total agreement with all the users that wrote they enjoyed this movie , because did too! but come on now tara reid parker posey and alan cummings should win an oscar ? seems a little bit much ! while previously mentioned trio steal show think talk is silly for kind of . it makes you laugh which what supposed to do as before steals such hillarious lines walls are mushy  if could go back time...i would meet snoopy know we can do...raise money search party organize bake sale my person favorite wouldn't be cool two rooms at once...i here...and over there room living bathroom closet bathroom...and just giggle too bad wasn't big success box office
definitely one of the 3 best bond movies and probably most iconic viz golden girl on laser table . goldfinger himself is also super villains
this is a really great movie!i totally agree with frankiefanatic04 ! of course person my best firend!!this movie had weird plot and was hard to follow , but who can pass up three punk rocking beautiful,fashionable funny girls ? one favorite movies the music makes me want rock night away!!! c ya lata all
hey ! i loves this movie have no idea why really because it's not like want to be a musician when grow up , but do love music maybe the punk girl group instead of all these boy groups . also lepoard print there's just something about that makes me think da bomb  know my mom doesn't agree with who cares she's grown i'm kid so right it that's c ya later
loved it !
my favorite bond film . it just had so many bests - best car , henchman name (miss galore)
a very funny movie to see .
excellent entertainment value . still enjoy watching it , though i have seen many times very stylish with a good cast gert forbes isn't one of the better bond villians but he is odd-job scary pussy galore makes most list actresses today look like cardboard cut-outs in comparism
nasty , vicious mean-spirited and hilarious . very well scripted a great performance by thornton sure to become christmas tradition at my house
very exciting movie with the best bond song ever . shirley bassey really belted out lyrics
i happen to love the stupid stereotypes- even affirmative actionone ! thought it was past time someone did a send-up of those blaxploitation race movies gets on soapbox if people would develop sense humor about our percieved differences- and not be so [expletive deleted] hypersensative- we in lot better shape as . this movie is step right direction steps down off thank you..
it was funny and witty . i enjoyed very much
funny . helen hunt was the best part of it though
hilarious watch it . do
this film was really funny . i took my german exchange student to see it , and she thought even though didn't understand !
this movie is hilarious . i love the outbursts by robin williams bastard son of barney you illegenament telli-tubbey
i thought this movie was great . expected it to suck , like everyone else did but it's so funny in a dark sort of way made me laugh lot look into the cutthroat world children's entertainment makes yoou think what kind bribes barney must have been taking during his supreme reign..
goldfinger (the third film in the james bond franchise released 1964) marks point where series reaches cruising altitude and speed . all of now expected elements are here : suave , lady-killer (sean connery) q's gadgets ; batmobilish automobile tongue-in-cheek puns a killer theme song by shirley bassey one also gets feeling that (gert frobe) is every bit equal 007 though on dark side first which has any real extended interaction with his chief nemesis resulting richer better character development movie introduces exotic sidekick oddjob (which was revisited man golden gun (1974)) returns to using intriguing names for primary girl form honor blackman as pussy galore only complaint this time editing problem near end when blindly trying defuse bomb nuclear scientist rushes down steps do it himself
a love this movie it is so funny and what to say about the song of penis
it reminded me of goofy time with my girlfriends talking about the love we longed for and laughs had . i thought was really cool cameron diaz
this movie was entirely misunderstood by a lot of critics and most the public at large . i found it to be brilliant experiment in acting use innovative camera techniques isn't film for uneducated masses who like hollywood slop delivered them neat little packages makes you ponder listen carefully what is being shown on screen complex multi-layered its approach david hyde pierce exquisite his character definitely heart piece catherine keener mary mccormick are also great steven soderburgh one talented directors business full frontal will some day recognised as masterpiece really
another great comedy that i could watch over and again never get tired of it . denise richards at her best  ! highly recommended
a movie that put johnathan demme on the map . it might've been too grizzly in nature to win best picture (oddly , whole year and month after its release) but with riveting perfomrances by anthony hopkins jodie foster this couldn't have never ignored
best bond movie
i've seen this movie 2 times already . i went once with my good friend , then two best guy friends and they even loved it it's a really well done sequel i'd definetly buy when comes out
great actresses who made an interesting story really fun . i enjoyed it a lot
this was a fun movie - much better than others i have seen lately . goldie did super job !
this was a great surprise to me as well my daughter . i don't really like katie holmes movies , and have her stereotyped in own mind dawson's creek but april very done film think that it will fall through the cracks is more of an 'art type' would recommend everyone give chance
the best of bond movies . shirley bassey sang theme song brilliantly
i am not a particular fan of tom hanks , but have to say he really impressed me in this one.that giggle was brilliant,i thought i'd die laughing.i had no idea that remake matter how good the original version certainly can match it.the coens are great.of course it is traditional hollywood comedy thats whats so great about it.wayans very criticised dont understand why excellent.the scene when remembers his childhood even worthy quentin tarantino.i enjoyed film lot .
hilarious movie . although a little bit of an older crowd in the theater i was , everybody laughing throughout hanks great as usual marlon wayans extremely funny and all other supporting actors were very good gets r rating for frequent use f bomb by but otherwise comedy
shirley eaton is fabulous .
this was about the funniest movie i've ever seen.every scene funny.intricate plot,clever dialogue,excellent acting,great cinematography and well written.this deserves to be much higher on list,my guess is that it's new many people haven't yet seen it.highly recommended !
oh man , we used to watch this movie so often in college during those hazy late nights after being out . i remember seeing the theaters with my folks and sister when was a kid loved it then still do many big name actors got their 'start' plot line is how japanese are trying find hollywood bomb year of 1941 great comedy slim pickens has role (short one but great) 'delicious nutritious carmel coated popper snacks!!!' am not biggest fan ferris wheels day because particular scene 'see grapefruit ? think it's rotten yep i'm going throw going....it's gone' cannot tell you girls buddy mine myself annoyed at parties bars would shake imaginary grapefruits recite that guess review does give too much insight into just shows movies happened be favorite for period time sure what other people about thinking now makes me want go rent tonight
i thought that this movie showed all kinds of genres and was very entertaining . it might be more a chick flick because emotional , but everyone did great job on ! must see
this was independent film gone wild . i'm told that most of the characters really were living in austin
no movie will ever be as great this one
hilariously funny
best movie ever...i could quote the entire move...my absolute favourite , i suggest you all rent it !
the best bond movie ever
ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!haha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha!ha !
a true classic movie of the bond series , all them are great but my opinion is that this one best .
one of the best bonds ever
adventure , religion nazis being vaporized serpants cryptology...this movie inspired me on so many levels .
anthony hopkins was truly amazing in this movie ..his voice really freaky . he deserved the oscar..it scary and it made beautifully from book..much better than its sequel
i haven't seen this movie . but , saw a lot of ads for it and think looks pretty good mandy moore is actress anyway really takes teenage life in whole different way she's afraid love until special man comes into her like the story line
i love this movie ! it teaches people that popularity isn't everything . loved
i loved this movie ! it showed that being popular isn't a must . its cute and lot like the world today
almost as funny the original . great cast : dre , eminem snoop george wallace shaq ludakris a follow up (25 yrs later) to one of comedies my time (car wash)
chessy story but very hillarious ! anyone who has liked the movie dumb and dumberer or that likes classic tv shows would like this comedy .
the ultimate date movie . this little-known laugh riot only lasted in theatres maybe one week before going straight to video and cable love stinks makes fatal attraction look like a ride at disneyland humor is raunchy times--but every zinger so intelligently written that you can't help but get absorbed by chemistry shared between beautiful , oh-so possessive bridgette wilson nice guy pushed too far antics of french stewart (from t.v.'s 3rd rock) course true lovers flick will be ones have first-hand experience bitter break-ups
that was funny !
funnies thing adam sandler has done in a long time . kudos to him
ohhh man i've been pimpin since , pimpin' funny junk !
for all it being stupid and dumb , i really enjoyed this movie ! couldn't stop laughing . is insane yt somehow manages to work ashton great in flick taken as a of art isn't that good simple predictable plot bathroom humour lously acting usually means diaster but with film works one the first dvd's ijr bought when got my dvd player classic
what's my tatoo say ? dude.. . no tell me what it says ! dude mine sweet does
um......brilliant !
i thought this film was totally hilarious ! only watched it cos my brother got for christmas , and expected to be pants but loved every minute of have never laughed so much at one . course has the gorgeous ashton in it..
very funny
i admit , you have to be a little twisted like this movie but that's the shear joy of it for fans that appreciate it...it's twistedness is .
this was so funny ! sure maybe a little sick at times , but i still love it
i love this movie in fact it is my favorite ever!! ! at first all of friends wanted to see and thought looked soooo stupid , but rented loved it's kinda bad though like the whole concept they run into bisexual stripper go a strip club,touch girl's hoo hoos well other,stuff funny
i thought this movie was funny !
my favorite movie of all time , pulp fiction is a masterpiece . i love everything about this film from the memorable characters with real personalities(samuel l jackson as scripture quoting hitman) humorous conversations (now look maybe your method massage differs mine,but you know touching his wife's feet and sticking tongue in holiest holies ain't same f***ing ballpark it league even sport.) excellent directing by quetin tarantino
aaaahahahahaha ! i thought this movie was soooo funny . some parts were like really fake though , but it still would recomend to anyone who has a sence of humor
this was another funny movie by rob . and of course collens hot so thats a plus for the
i loved the animal  . when went to see it , was expecting yet another pointless comedy with no real storyline and a lot of bad jokes surprised discover that while this movie is definately also had some depth serious moments couldn't help but feel sorry for marvin police officer wannabe who cannot seem do anything right he well thought out character unusual five stars !
this movie was hilarious!! !
i love this movie . the cast is phenomenal , dialog very entertaining and storyline too cool one of tarantinos 3 best (true romance resevoir dogs being other 2) yes am a little twisted lol
ya great movie
the movies going to be kick-ass i saw trailer and read about it it'll better than first
tarantino is unique when it comes to his movies . he casts those that are perfect for their roles and you could never imagine anyone else playing the part this gave john travolta a comeback was expected happen showed how much talent ability play other parts
this is the best movie of all time...morris chestnut looked sooo sexy...i wish i was playing in that with him...vivica fox did an excellent job also...she actress time!!!! !
wow . i was blown away by this film it's one of the greatest crime/thriller films ever made : performances from hopkins as hannibal lecter and foster clarice starling make it more haunting experience with his wide eyes soft voice is chilling frightening , way directed absolutely brilliant oscar-winning script ted tally bought movie on vhs because so good highly recommend to everybody (over 16) even if they get scared easy summary a well-crafted but great
entertaining all the way through . never a dull moment and full over every emotion qt knows how to cast right person get best out of them make kick*ss ride movie
this is a great movie . i ust got the dvd and it has lotof extra scenes commentary by director you can really see what was meant to be before editors at
i'll be right back , now i gotta go spank my monkey ! need say more ? never saw it . just remember that line from the preview and thought brendan did a good job delievering was only part made me laugh into hyperventalate see guess
i could not have had a more different experience with this movie than shroomwoman . loved flick seeing the billed as comedy and that steve martin was lead , expecting light roxanne-like might be good for couple of laughs what got bizarre dark little about complacent dentist (martin) who makes bad decisions sees his life spiral out control while there are funny scenes is in no way think donnie darko jerk were some outstanding performances by bit parts - scott caan villain kevin bacon star doing research murder mystery film course laura dern weird creepy strongly recommended if you like kind thing
this is a first rate comedy . never has vamp's power over men of all kinds been more hillariously portrayed than in film i loved it start to finish !
obviously one of the greatest , but definitly it won't appeal to all people . this is cleary a dialogue movie meaning that most consists just whether in car at house or bar don't get wrong impression from there great action right times and are huge amount famous actors/actresses film not my favorite up
i seen this movie when was about 12 years old . funny ! even more funnier today since am older and understand it probably the only like to watch with howie mandel or ted danson amased how young dennis franz looks people who dumb dumberer would some of movies that are considered bad funniest is a you got relax
one of the best movies you've probably never seen . a clever crime caper , full unexpected plot shifts that have to be carefully watched for in order not get lost michael caine's first american movie (quickly snapped up after success ipcress file) playing devilish mastermind harry dean opposite shirley maclaine's ditzy innocent nicole chang with help john abbott's master sculptor emile they concoct scheme rob priceless sculpture from ahmad shahbandar (done regal splendor by underrated herbert lom) wealthy recluse who longs remembrance his late wife (who just so happens dead ringer character) this trickery gains access shahbandar's ritzy apartment complex where must smuggled out using series expected events require split-second timing as you might expect dark comedy nothing comes off right until surprising ending (which i won't give away) if you're exhausted green-screen explosions and puerile sitcom extensions try 1966 heist yarn appreciate time when were talent-heavy story-driven
loved it! ! a laff riot!!!!
very innovative
i would normally give this one 4 stars , but i'm giving 5 because everyone else seems to be bashing it so badly . liked can see though how some fundamentalist types might upset by the dantean-catholic-newage vision of heaven/hell mythos thing that was funniest me at time running gag about saintly henry winkler ! remember as badass fonzie in happy days anyone old enough contreversy character ? times have changed
very funny , i saw it in the movies and adam sandler is a pothead .
this movie is so stupid , but funny . it's such a relief to see that rodney dangerfield still acting and in case adam sandler his usual dumb character time nicky the son of devil who sent find 2 brothers have just broken out hell cameos jon lovitz henry winkler show up cameo roles
i have watched this film countless times and never get tired of it . quentin tarantino's characters dialogue are second to none
this is a great movie and it really funny must c 4 all skateboarders people who dig movies i hope they make grind 2
such intelligent and sophisticated direction is perfectly complimented by quentin tarantino's masterful screenwriting . nobody turns a phrase quite like the knoxville native this far most popular film he's ever directed yet it may not even be best in pulp ficiton he takes what did reservoir dogs with unchronological story telling refines beautifully my more exciting of two , but one concise important scene : jules winfield's pre-killing monologue
gets better every time i see it .
this movie isn't going to win any awards , but i think it was a cute .
quinten tarantino has a way to create story , make it go backwards than flip upside-down and you want rant rave about for the rest of your existance . out few movies he made this is my favorite i will strike down with great vengenance furious anger those who attempt poison destroy brothers know name lord when lay vengance apon thee -pulp fiction
if u look at the case of movie then you probly will think it looks retarded but storyline is different would .
great movie and not boring . bob sagets performance is a+ ! bloopers were at the end of
one of the top five greatest films ever!!!! ! and if you did not getit are an idiot
i thought it was funny , but not as if would have had its origional actors . the overall quality of movie great others
if you loved the first one you'll love this . i thought a sequel would suck but was wrong,it hilarious , haven't laughed that much at movie in long time
great movie ! full of suspense . well acted(anthony hopkins is awsome!) and directed who knew a film about canabalism whould be hit definitly recomended
tarantino's best and my favorite movie . unique , thrilling has some of the written dialoge ever what else hasn't already been said a great
i went to see this thinking it would not be very good but was wrong . is one of the funniest movies have ever seen laughed so hard whole time thought even funnier than first everyone needs movie
i thought it was very good . had a story funny and even made me cry ! not really all that much of chick flick either
this was so entertaining and i think the wayne's everyone else in it who worked on , did an amazing job ! congratulations to those people you must see if haven't already!
i would say something but you've already said it all ; this movie is awesome !
best movie ever .
greatest movie of all time!!!! !
i guess once again i'm in the minority here . tomcats had me stitches it's one of raunchiest comedies i've ever seen
too many older folks , not enough josh hartnett ! :)
one of my favorite quentin tarentino films , next to kill bill and reservior dogs .
worst movie ever . loved it
i am sorry but have watched this movie over 20 times and laugh every time . daddy would you like some sausage ? the backwards man is hysterical!! ! for those of who find offensive.. lighten up!! it just a tom green tries to get audience at any cost
one of the greatest movies all time . i found my self puzzled and thrilled there is a never ending climax to this movie plot , story line great amazing actors acting take film from board turn it into real in your face sort deff worth buying or renting -sliptodd-
i absolutely looooove tom green ! wacking off a horse is the funniest part
it was awesome- playing with a dead antelope- al i can say is- he's pure genious ! lol
tom green is the best
hehhe , loved this movie couldnt stop laughing . 5 stars greatest ever oscar winner wooo
yet again , another film by tarintino seeping with style and finesse . his editing storylines are absolutely seamless - he effortlessly moves the plot from past to present one characters perspective point where its a work of art samuel jackson just radiates cool
simply genious !
this movie was just great . it so funny imagine going on a cruise like that , would be real fun
i loved it .
ishtar is en extremly funny movie . it a real spoof of lawrence arabia-type movies , and really does work in spots pretty goofy the scripts got confusing but it's
one of the best tom green movies and my all time favourites . its hilarious about a guy who promises his niece that she would pay her tuition to harvard , but also fiancee buy house he tries make them both happy by spending savings on think way get $20000 for with friend duff played needless say...hilarity ensues !
the nonfiction much-written-about events of this movie were not at all new to me , yet impact seeing 'end spear' was fresh heart-piercing motivating and if ever word should be used : poignant that's what it . u.s missionaries in ecuador seek out unreached cannibalistic waodani tribe are killed by them beginning family members then go live with which places trust christ redemption is told thru eyes a missionary's son highly recommend for christians--don't know about nonchristians they might find concept absurd ex when as kid asked his dad would shoot attacked said "son we can't they're ready heaven are." (well-done beautiful film but suspend disbelief regards failure makeup show aging characters over decades.)
this movie was really funny . you know how see a commercial for comedy , go the and realize that all parts were in preview ? is not one of those movies whole thing good from beginning to end great characters story
this was an excellent movie . okay , travolta calls up the same corny southern accent he used in primary colors but it's refreshing to watch a film that assumes you're literate and promotes learning as virtue emotions of cinematography is overwhelming later when katrina hit i found myself wondering what happened house great performances by all
little red riding hood is a crapy hole
jodie foster . brilliant , as always
i recently saw this movie with some friends . is edge-of-you-seat yet still an interesting story where you want to know what happens and not corny like action thrillers highly reccomend it
it's really a shame the series couldn't survive lowest common denominator of ratings . anything written by someone with 3 figure iq will probably die an early death on today's television , unless it earns some notoriety like religious one everybody is freaking out about
all the right elements are in mix : pace is fast without being confusing , humor dry and witty action exciting suspenceful . if anything missing its over-blown (and obvious) computer graphics clichs of a doomed futuristic world that have become standard for sci-fi (or any other summer blockbuster matter) rather this an actual story people with complicated pasts uncertain futures ; it just happens to be set outer space movie should touchstone movies but especially wherein focus on how each particular person -- keeping his character reacts environment
incredible movie . works best for fans of the 'firefly' series , but should be thoroughly enjoyable almost any fan sci-fi character development and writing is miles ahead what george lucas has done with star wars since 'the empire strikes back' deserves a shot @ becoming franchise..

awesome performance by theron .
the best movie made in a long time ! harsh reality . first that ever had an effect on my life i now notice and am aware of racism around me...even little comments one hears...i pick up it must see! urge everyone to watch
this movie is about as good they get . very important for people to watch prejiduce alive today it has ever been folks
one hell of a movie .
samuel jackson is the best thing that happend to this movie . doesn't get boring , action and comedy are superb john travolta very good himself
once again i find myself defending a movie to all my friends which loved and they didn't . only problem with the is that title cover imply an action-type , when film was really more of thinker other than thought it superbly written directed it's hard follow differnet sub-plots but that's beauty ; subtlties tie stories together like fact not skewed toward specific race shows very present condition races judging their own preconcieved prejudices even sometimes subconciously at same time seemingly most racist character in (matt dillan) has somewhat defendable position due situation his father-- as do characters life situations brilliant from sides
wow . in the tradition of latin american or guy ritchie cinema...this movie is one those films that brings it all together neatly but up until does you are left waiting breathlessly great performances by , esp cheadle bullock newton and howard a real plus to see be very unlikeable wonderful film watch more than once
amazing , dramatic story about several different people all with ethnicities backgrounds and life styles . excellent performances by everyone this movie gives a powerful message of the current realities racism in america must see way !
this movie is really good . it isn't the same old story we've all seen a million times...its very original just came out on dvd recently and i recommend that you at least rent if have ever read "brave new world" (which everyone should its great book) will appreciate similarities
one of the most underrated movies year . could have been a little smarter in certain parts , but lot fun
a brilliantly told nasty story . every role is well played , the script crisp and clever direction first rate
clever , artistic and real talent combine to make a proper family movie . no super-heroes saving the universe here just down-to-earth creativity humourous boot !
wallace and gromit are , without a doubt the two most charming lovable heart-warming sweet-natured characters to ever grace both television silver screen . "the curse of were-rabbit" is outrageously funny quite simply hilarious being insulting nick park genius ; this movie labor love best one i have seen w&g not just for kids some adults who head over heels in with dynamic duo worldly sophisticated accomplished even cynical people know wallace's big goofy grin gromit's deep soul eyes captured hearts from all age groups walks life i'd give it six stars they were available ! :)
this is by far one of the best movies i've ever seen . being an avid rabbit lover and owner it reminded me my bunnies so much its just overall cute funny i loved saw twice to take in all things may have missed can't belive that clay-mation could be precise entertaining bravo makers amazing movie isn't for kids , alot adult humor also
just like the videos i own . funny and cute
and , thus my streak of picking superb movies to see at the theatre continues . fantastic four incredibles shrek 2 sky captain world tommorow spider-man star wars : revenge sith now wallace & gromit curse were-rabbit ! based on three very amusing (especially "the wrong trousers") shorts from aardman animation this british-originated claymation feature hits all right notes as many others have said steals show--without saying a word his expressions say it plot is quite humorous although menacing not excessivly dark sense humor that movie has great with awesome puns sight gags some moments nearly break fourth wall even mild double entendres good character designs are exteremely appealing overall was throughly enjoyable film
seldom do i get so much pure viewing pleasure from a film in the cinema as did while watching 'the curse of were-rabbit' . for those you unfamiliar with wallace and gromit , they are loveable clay motion creations nick park : slightly gormless unfailingly polite bachelor inventor his long-suffering intellectual canine partner their relationship is like that an old married couple adventures which entangled utterly incongruous domestic natures this running humane pest control service find themselves dealing beast enormous mutant were-rabbit who endangering prize vegetables grown by local villagers to exhibit at annual fair unapologetically silly deviously clever paying homage king kong jaws whole rake early horror flicks revelling hackneyed characters populate such films - superstitious village yokels semi-crazed preacher etc it would have been easy filmmaker drop these references heavy-handed fashion sticking out anomalies flow story was case places shrek but park's touch deft natural add entertainment value adults children alike albeit different reasons there also love interest although don't expect your emotions wrenched other than am giving nothing away twist tale may not see coming just watch
this movie was the best ! everything so interesting i just couldn't look away .
this movie has become the basis of comparison for all movies i've seen since . absolutely king in areas it tries at : style , dark humor original filmmaking dialogue and action a++
this is the absolute best movie ! all girls are great actors , and since books they dont change too much just everything done perfectly . i would definately recommend it to anyone see
this movie paints an incredible picture of a gambling addict . john anthony (mccoughnahay) is stellar ex-college athlete who's career was ended by injury the guy sits around office and more or less miserable when he catches big break due to his knack for sports , goes from basically farmboy nyc hot-shot overnight rises falls quickly but he's not with problem - that's walter (pacino) lives thrill victory defeat explains that addicts are actually addicted winning it's losing they crave moment you know you've got it all on line everything own riding one bet...nothing can match high renee russo excellent in her supporting role as walter's wife who refuses give up him
this was an excellent french film by the woman who starred in amelie . has some regulars very engaging taking place during world war i , about a polio infected searching for her lost lover is missing action as comes to end complex plot that unfolds beautifully jodie foster plays part it which eliminated from contention best foreign category at academy awards
a fantastic movie and the best in series so far , with great combination of action fantasy horror adventure teen romance to make an awesome blockbuster . be warned that this is quite scary little kids might get scared
though it is getting damned with faint praise by the critics , i find (as a potter non-reader) that stories get increasingly more compelling to adult viewer . goblet of fire was an interesting and exciting movie liked seeing while harry can go toe-to-toe fiercest dragons evilest dark lords he can't laid you'd think just wiggle [both] his magic wands at delightfully witchy firm buttocks hermoine granger her hogwarts' skirt would magically up little black witch thong down last see bad-assed dude named voldermort as most horror movies (except for alien) what you imagine far scarier than on screen looked something like lovechild nosferatu creature from lagoon if he's so evil how could let essentially kick shiite out him in battle death be one olsen twins knocking mike tyson course it's only big issue this pg-13 real some stupid daddio behind me took six-year kid watch th every 10 minutes reassuring "it's not scary right?" near end 6-year old sounds peed pants terror moaning images skeletons blood idiot going okay...you'll alright." li'l probably able sleep next years
definetely the best of 4 movies . had a better and more mature story line to it , just like book for most part stayed close characters were played new ie : cedric fleur krum cho etc amazing great special effects in challenges especially dragon scene very emotional scary
an instant classic as soon it came out.like resevoir dogs a must see brutally honest and violent vision by qt.inspired performances all .
a wonderful allegory to the story of christianity . parallels were unbelievable watching aslon climb mountain bore striking resemblace jesus in garden even if you're not looking for ties , it was still great film that i would recommend anyone and battle scenes non-gory enough whole family
i thought the movie had that edgey feel of actually being there . was very close to book and it an amazing theme acting could use a touch up but other than wonderful hope show my children if have any graphics were also
saw this today ! it was great . entertaining , warm and a pleasure to not be distracted from the film by better known child actors...a wonderful movie kamy : found re cat with spectacles on blog "maybe crayoned marking that edmund did when he went into witch's house earlier anyone notice painting mustache onto one of stone statues ? looked like had grabbed black charcoal but could have been another color i wasn't sure if will make pay close attention go back see both points because didn't what you're referring to."
definitely worth seeing . finally , a "family" flick that doesn't put me to sleep like lotr it took long time before film technology could do justice it's very imaginative story tht allows people choose how much symbolism is involved supposedly author c s lewis based the hero (a lion) on certain figure prominently featured in new testament acting was decent i loved tilda swinton "the deep end." she plays beyotchee witch with perpetual bad hair days which seems her murderous rage all does job swordplay -- even skinny little arms as always say mark of great actress ability wield swords or launch kicks take julia roberts jennifer aniston overated damsels ; only thing tough they can pout while smoking cigarette
top notch movie making here . you can bring anyone from 3 to 83 and they will be entertained !
this was wierd and fantastic . the best part when bruce willis went back killed rapists
there is no doubt that this will be a classic . "the chronicles of narnia : the lion , witch and wardrobe" solid representation c.s lewis's world ; are few tweaks in storyline (the beginning story mostly but more realistic approach appreciated real portion movie) it quite faithful to novel synopsis  i wont get into you probably have already read pros only with level computer technology could we such rich fluid does imagination justice (and for those critics who sticking their nose up air saying "well my was far better" i'd wager say if put your glorious imagined version on screen most people would highly disagree short "stow it") as mentioned before little done stray from (there three or four notable exceptions they do not detract children did an admirable job portraying peter susan edmund lucy georgie henley (lucy) particularly impressive think shed give dakota fanning run her money non-human characters were well rendered great battle though somewhat brief soundtrack beautiful two hour twelve minute running time passes quickly compared cons certainly aslan easy me forgive since bringing see kids theater had difficult sitting through hours hope once released dvd might involve feel cg failed im still trying figure out why cat end (during coronation scene) mustache eyeglasses clearly drawn him like some prankster went microsoft paint program hand-drawn maybe bizarre inside joke totally distracted movie overall definitely worth seeing buying
amazing ! (especially if you read the book first) . what a great family film for everyone to enjoy
hella tight , but too short
i really loved this movie . thought it was funny and even though a kids animated kept my attention throughout the characters were all very interesting penguines hillarious
brilliant movie . very funny and fab animations i love the lemurs- like to move it ! penguins are as well definately 5 star
i deffinately loved this movie.. . like to move it it. hahaha... is a family friendly movie , and reccomend all ages.. xd
this movie was so unique and fascinating . however , it a case of you either loved or hated the narrative storyline is interesting characters are uniquely quirky dialogue sticks out as one most innovative things about film just great creative vision well worth several watchings
great fun--clever and well drawn ! i'm almost 50 , saw it without kids loved waiting for the sequwl.. .
very cute . funny well done a lot of adult jokes , that no child would get but laugh at anyway the penguins were awesome and so was melmin (the giraffe)
5-star excellence , yet niche appeal only . capote is a brilliant examination of the human psyche in particular capote's with themes societal marginalization narcissim empathy and intersection/overlap same this movie chronicles writing book about kansas quadruple murder 'in cold blood,' torturous sublime project that required years emotional dedication during which something an outsider himself drew close to one 2 sociopaths thru relationship elicited facts for 'capote' not entertaining--there's no suspension disbelief escapist action or comedy intellectual diversion whodunit nor drama happy ending but it display crisp filmmaking--no extaneous story unnecessary dialogue extra emotion quality acting lead actor philip seymour hoffman rightly earned his golden globe consequently will those who admire crafts americana aficionados writers especially true crime genre might also have special interest who'd most appreciate be involved by profession circumstance getting info from drawn- out emotionally toilsome legal process--such find i-am-not-alone comfort
what philip seymour hoffman does in the title role is less acting than it an act of necromancy . i am always reverent awe when witness truly great , and that's you'll see here nothing stupendous as truman capote he brings character back to life same way that jack nicholson did with "hoffa" george c scott "patton." where 1967 film "in cold blood" focused on 2 killers murders they committed their trial eventual execution "capote" focuses instead monumentally-talented monumentally-egotistical tortured man who immortalized them his classic "non-fiction novel." covers period from first read clutter ny times november 1959 until executions perry smith richard hickock april 1965 kansas supporting cast uniformly excellent particularly noteworthy are clifton collins jr catherine keener harper lee chris cooper detective alvin dewey it's very rare i'm so enthusiastic about a contemporary movie take my heartfelt advice run don't walk you probably won't be able catch at your local multiplex mall theatre (which will playing "harry potter" theatres latest adam sandler-tara reid movie) but if do revere like think this one want miss trust me it'll worth effort searching out
totally awesome movie , its a timeless classic everyone should see .
despite the fact that my top 10 of all time includes movies from 30's , 40's and 50's this ranks #1 . amazing acting characters story dialogue
the funniest of rash owen wilson/vince vaughn moves that have come out in recent years . i highly recommend it
well , i caught the 4:00 pm showing of this movie at theater and returned for 9:30 tonight . while got off to a slow start during first 15 minutes was left wonder what exactly hype all about when actually started my question answered it's friggin' hillarious vince vaughn is hero mine (i'll forgive him misfortune that be cool) made even more so in eyes his facial expressions were nothing short priceless he delivers lines with such vigor it looks as though most fun he's had on set long time owen wilson wonderful playing typical player-but-nice-guy-at-the-same-time role which perfect rude unappologetic both audiences today an uproar laughter will promptly added collection once out dvd wedding season !
i was lucky enough to view an advanced screening of wedding crashers last thursday night . hilarious doesn't do the film justice you know how in most films remember funniest parts and bring them up as leave theater ? this one , it's hard best because there's so many unlike his previous where vince vaughn is usually reduced role 'scene stealer' here we get a full dose babaganush he's finest form since 'swingers' if liked him swingers/made persona you'll love some riffs that he has literally will have holding your sides with laughter owen wilson either like or don't more straight man although does pretty good lines too great chemistry especially scenes they're fighting ying vaughn's yang movie certainly 'earns' r rating healthy nudity sex related hijinks f-bombs but not 'gross out' humor la american pie it pushes boundaries just 'shock value' way genuinely funny saw bunch critics who jaded type were laughing their asses well guys be quoting for rest year girls though there romantic subplot (cheesy at times forgivable given is) rachael mcadams doing job wilson's interest isla fischer plays serving psycho chris walken overall..inappropriate glorious better than oldschool anchorman comedy maybe couple years
excellent ; thoughtful , informative interesting
i thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end . granted , i'm fascinated by the history of time period portrayed and politics involved if you're not interested in those things you may get much movie  but should see it anyway & try understand what it's all about is as current today was way back when funny (or not) how repeats a type with message will always be relavent no matter which side political spectrum prefer thought brilliantly filmed black white editing camera angles dialougue intelligent at times quite low-key sort there's more going on than meets eye finally made me want find out even characters can make pick up book then has done job
this movie was awesome . the story so interesting because of historical aspects and acting really good...plus it had a lot humor clever intense , i'd watch again in heartbeat
a truly excellent movie from disney . mixing slick direction , great acting an and fascinating plot with humor this is success beginning to end the progression of that quite interesting includes several twists nicolas cage leads cast which also christoper plummer jon voight i love pro-democracy vibe such as when looks in awe at particular line basically boils down whoever has power do what right responsibility that's so true ! ending definately my kind
a great family movie with an excelent twist , how do you find treasure when first have to map ? my dad even got into this one on account of it made mention his group the masons (i think i can that he is since they don't seem be quite as secretive once were) and does not watch too many disney movies anymore . film contained so much obviously well researched historical information was acted actually started wondering if real
davinci code lite (in fact , did you catch dr . gates' alias was brown) but it very entertaining and an outstanding family film in that my kids learned something by watching the on-location scenes particularly philadelphia (hey look i remember place me louie tunutos got a cheesesteak 1979) were great give 2 thumbs big toes penis (the cute blonde curator) up
i loved national treasure ! went to see it with my dad for last brithday , and we both laughed through . it's very well done actually has an interesting story line nicholas cage did a great job as the other actors actresses highly reccomend this movie anyone who wants adventure
possibly the best movie i have ever seen.. .
i thoroughly enjoyed the movie , myself . it's an action flick that obviously doesn't take itself too seriously some of dialogue in it is hysterical and there's even a bit history lesson if you're paying attention this reminded my indiana jones movies which also good clean for whole family imho
i really enjoyed this movie ! a great amount of action , fun for the whole family 4.5 or so might be better rating but overall it was very entertaining . i'm not big fan nicolas cage it's easy to forget about him watching engrossing and riley hilarious
awesome movie...really interesting
a very fun movie . it had excitment and humor bond well while i don't care much for nicoles cage still really like his performance friend was hillarious worth watching
yaaaaay . pure entertainment
this is super good ! nicholas cage preforms at his best . suspense , humor romance everything in one movie i completley forgot was a theatre b/c never got bored and moved my eyes from the screen people ages 6-60 were
great movie , but i wanted more of the family/personal life .
this is a very great movie . reese witherspoon stunning both her and phoenix do remarkable cover of cash's songs you don't need to know anything about cash appreciate his story he's got whirlwind problems , drugs women the whole bit but life eventually revolves around touring partner future wife june carter (witherspoon) she basically saved him from self-destruction
excellent flick . not perfect , but osacar nominations are a certainty
a labour of love for kevin spacey . the film hops between genres bio-pic and musical , with flashbacks into subconscious main character in way that is little scattered but i don't think it harms telling good story or examination driven charismatic bobby darin looks like he having pure ball when he's singing darin's songs
in gruesome perfection , 'hostel' gives a taste of hell an exhibition depravity so deep that man actually pays to sin the most desperately wicked ways and satan laughs at making his "b*tch." three guys go into hostel...likeable enough only flirting with really on trip just trying be happy . but one by they end up victims pay-to-torture sadism club $25,000 for american near flawless story characters acting directing set music production even empathetic protagonist denouement if your resolution must save $ fleshes out inspires responses evil--despair energization or numbness this movie is filled nudity drugs extreme gore it's not glorified i recommend exposing man's sinsickness hope viewers might seek cure (last week's news here florida showed how sadistic tendency more now restricted government torture internet sites : was arrested double murder after spending money bus taxi hotel manhunting park because he said felt like killing another 2 were videotaped beating homeless men smiling through it all.)
one of the most beautiful movie ive seen in years . great , i mean excellent music duchovny made a work as director and writter kudos for him
if you are easily offended by rap music and don't like to hear a lot of swaring this movie is probably not for . on the other hand , want rough uncompromising look at prostitution breaking into industry just might be story where poor boy makes it rich because he's nice guy who simply gave shot instead its gritty glimpse profession that while glamorized in today's pop culture shown dirty entrapping turns out there people business with emotions self-asteem despite tremendous stresses they experience rare story-driven about subject often dealt give one try but i think can very objective evaluation conflicts your own values lifestyle
i loved this movie . diane lane and john cusack had very good chemistry the story kept me interested while there were serious moments , also a lot of light hearted my favorite part as when she answered her father's personal add
concur with seraph . this is one of the better suspense movies i've seen in a while i'll cite few reasons why i liked movie : 1) very good plot it's got all that new orleans' hoodoo/voodoo interacial gobbledygook which always for scare (much more effective than lamo "haunted mansion" disney offering) they do great job tricking viewer into thinking who "whodunit" ; but no suspects what really transpires creative ending 2) locales pre-katrina orleans and neighboring terrebonne parish are depicted even before hurricanes hit , you get idea part country where off having gills an umbrella strapped to your head recall on charleston sc ghost walk tour guide commenting ranks distant second sightings look at i'm reminded dan aykroyd's comment "we're central station." it uses location create haunting mood since philadelphia "the sixth sense." 3) kate hudson hot pretty actress boot(y) you'll see her panty-clad scenes tight-jeans damsel-in-distress scene
wonderously delicious ! something for everyone . kids will love the visuals and fantasy-like storytelling adults cultural in-jokes , dark humor johnny depp's hilarious deadpan delivery i adore oompa loompas (all played by same actor) how they pop up in different settings costumes throughout their musical numbers are funny over-the-top especially esther-williams takeoff heavy metal band freddie highmore is a perfect choice to play charlie bucket full of wide-eyed innocence grace foil charicatured that embody variety social moral ills director tim burton master creepy/cartoony scenery this film one his best ever
i adored the movie , went and saw it with my friend beth in theatre to be 100% honest liked a lot better then original . johnny depp plays best willy wonka !
i saw this for the first time at a midnight showing and loved it so much ! movie is one of all-time greatest movies
much better than i expected . excellent ! the story , casting and cinemaphotography were all great this will definitely go down in history as one of john singleton's greatest movies
macho with a soft side , whodunit quality story pathos and some good action scenes though it's not the whole way through . sweet goodytwoshoes lady in detroit took numerous foster children years but actually adopted four of them that were unique ways unadoptable/degenerates anyway later she is shot prompting her now adult sons to reunite seek out truth about shooting recognized most actors can't recall names except mark wahlberg (one brothers) terrance howard cops on case) motown soundtrack i think everyone would enjoy this never boring good-vs-evil redemption movie bad language bit violence sexual explicitness
a good movie with little play on history . cast , well written story and great effects fair balanced telling of the which appears to have gained favor some muslim groups shines better light arabs then most movies done worth seeing big screen !
oh my goodness , i loved this movie . was skeptical at first because film just doesn't have the same spark as a live broadway show but totally blew me away its beautiful to watch and emmy rossum who plays christine is fantastic she has true talent
i was fortunate enough to get see this on broadway and captivated...so naturally when the movie came out really excited . loved fact that in they add a background story for phantom it is beautifully done
nowadays , people don't seem to understand the word talent!! ! (singing dancing costumes settings a++++) phantom of opera is an excellent movie that was well written and composed in fashion . not only plot interesting but were very beautiful music spectacular whether you enjoy classical or surely can appreciate effort put into this film amount practice went composing performing these pieces incredible tell it actors actresses appearance on set a sweet love story filled with much passion great talent - i kid actually sing unlike lot today's society
i found silence of the lambs to be one greatest horror films ever made because it works on two levels . first is a brilliant psychological thriller and shocking bizzare often time frightning film not metion breakthrough script,magnificent directing ingenious performances from jodie foster (the man) anthony hopkin's as now famed hannibal lector this picture put suspence type movie goers in same theater with friday thirtenth fans through highl highly recommended ! thinking man's
i haven't seen it yet , but really want to looks good is ?
a really funny , family movie . the kids are great actors and story is
i'm glad this movie was made . it's a slice of real life whether you like it or not homosexuality has been around since the beginning time--it's going away folks instead constantly persecuting these people , maybe time to try and understand them i think is small step in right direction all "brokebutt" comments are so juvenile ignorant need grow-up we focus on more pressing issues that really affecting society have problem with my tax dollars being used raise children who too stupid lazy practice birth control
the feel-good comedy of christmas season!! ! michelle williams character to heath ledger  : " i knew you two were up something on your fishing trips when didn't bring home any trout.... . said a mouthful , honey but beware.. lots man-cuddle action kind like mid-night mass for gay community no jokes allowed... ever so serious & we must be reverent not joke about sounding titles humourous nature.... boom-boom mountain smelly tent nervous sheep ky bloody stool etc ad infinitum... amen kid around because love actually unlike movie us have seen..... worth 9 bucks suppose
excellent..........a long over due movie . love is regardless of the gender person you
pulp fiction is one of the most eclectic films ever made . that being said , it's well-blended stories and certainly odd ones at are told to us not in chronoligical order but mixed together a way evoke terrific power emotion dialogue definitely best i've heard film although it employs more explatives than usually movies 1994 they used right places adding feeling lines unlike modern where words added give them movie r rating visiual style excellent as well quite possibly year for since 1939
this is an awesome move . the movie was beautifully directed and skillfully acted i am sorry to break it all those who have not seen refuse see because of their homophobic fears but foresee at least one oscar coming for sexual seens kissing were a very small part story true love results what happens in life when men try please society rather than hearts ladies gent... life! !
update ; having seen this excellent film , the soul-love portrayed transcends sexes of people involved and takes us on a human journey love that through fear society's constraints (not god's)they are unable to naturally express . conform they get married in process hurt more yet not so much as hurting themselves which you will experience depth their understand is greater than two protaganists.superbly acted norainbows if didn't it you've got problem only has won top prizes at cannes venice but critics reviewer's award sounds cracking good can't wait see for those who think it's just gay film..well above all misrepresentative cowboys what do went when guys were up mountains own ? louie : king kong ! my fears confirmed have lot growing
i was at first frustrated by the movie . loved breath-taking cinematography , acting score subtle messages of confusion and over all story but did not feel a connection between jack twist ennis del mar understand why when they were consummating their relationship distant ; apart felt that this flaw in weaves out 20-year love affair then realized brilliance movie- it examines two real men who are struggling with own sexuality identity while trying to express pure do simply don't know what intense feelings except child-like frolicking fierce testosterone driven anger love-making (there only brief scenes so straight can watch easily) go see for topics tackles loss blame society must take robbing these beautiful creatures victimizing people want themselves one is far breathtaking masterpiece best year
great movie . have you noticed that all of the negative ratings were by people who haven't even seen ? it's amazing how homophobic closeted are
i loved this very beautiful , sad and poignant movie about wasting a life love because of fear--fear others living honestly . we've all experienced fear to some degree in our lives have paid price for it that's why movie's appeal is universal we can relate
best movie of the year . acting great , filming excellent writing and directing beyond belief finally something worth spending money to go see not a remake big ape running through new york or family who never heard birth control truly outstanding !
with a small amount of trepidation , i walked into the theatre my spouse to see this film yesterday evening . once got past gratuitous/obligatory homophobic case heebie jeebies settled in and realized why picture is being nominated for awards left right it an excellent movie homosexuality not even particularly "central" theme brokeback mountain love story it's sad one noted above that "gay" component central because lots stories are romances between people fail flourish or "succeed" any host reasons human experience limited queers doomed nature relationship as much result choices protagonists make unwillingness many larger society accept gay couples relationships performances by both lead actors ledger were sensitive over top ledger's character was truly most haunted/conflicted pair develops young men price tickets good investment i'm glad saw feeling rather fates characters has had me thinking all day
pulp fiction is dizzying , dazzling piece of film-making with excellent dialogue acting directing and overall a real thrill . i could watch it over again quentin tarantino bet his debut by far if you haven't seen this you're missing out summary : one the great films 90s
munich is a triumph . (jaws  : fish bites boat......... et fuggly alien can be cuddly...... saving private ryan wwii was about dumb-dumb matt damon ? ) this movie speilberg's redemption song eric bana knight on quest to vanquish evil , but as we know like the poor our lord said will always with us...our best friend intimate enemy violence and shock value puts other hacks shame....... ( scott / scorcese attenborough coppolla peckinpah tarantino etc these lessons of learned & re-learned off screen -----god help us
very , solid movie . jack black was surprisingly good in this one the special effects are mind blowing peter jackson hits over fence again ! my question would be "what is with sleeveless dress december new york city at top of empire state building?" girl unphased and can climb ladders that kind weather ?
in this age of endless gorey violence films , nice to see that the old classics still survive .
anyone who says this movie is bad was ether not paying attention or couldn't look past the violence . very smart and phycological it full of all worlds : comedy , drama suspense irony crime but real thing that made good character building the(what ignorant people call pointless ) conversations between main characters build a sort warm different type gangster in which we have never seen before what makes terintino mastermind genius if you can halarious incredible acting my favorite time one best !
good movie , funny yet clean will ferrell is great . he probably one of the best up and coming actors right now
another excellent movie more concerned with complex story telling instead of gun play , explosions and enormous body counts . if you are not familiar cronenberg's style might like it he's for everyone
a history of violence is an examination the grip and depth human . portrayal not artistic like natural born killers , nor deglorified overchoreographed thrill scenes from mr instead it raw realistic graphic necessary if sex nudity are either temptations or offenses to you don't see this movie performances screenplay a+ technical part as good especially which were few in concept but mechanical (i felt someone was saying "freeze need capture pubic hair," "shift another butt shot.") has no tidy wrap-up ending upper downer just reality biblically portrays both miserable condition/need man man's sublime possibilities exposes futility contrivances for escaping/avoiding evil (pain chaos unhappiness) while subtly pointing only true way deliverance
wickidly done . what scares people the most about this movie is that girl possessed by devil and demons stuff like can really happin
awesome film ! too bad there have been so many knock offs since .
i know jarheads , 'cause are one . you could only get a more accurate picture of what the corps is by picking my brain for couple days or going to boot camp yourself !
great inside look at a soldier's life and dramatic view of what many endure . i felt like this was honest into daily not some glorified movie war is 'real'
holocaust movie , but it takes place in present day (not too many flashbacks either and those are hazy) : "never forget." that's the whole i haven't ruined for you since impact is delivery . glorious van gogh colors quirky touches of humor then hinting entry unease "whomp!" a blow to chest leaving me dumbfounded frozen eyes welled-up--when got my car cried couldn't stop wows huhs psychological trip forget if tried stars elijah wood as jonathan "the collector," an american jew who ponders photo late grandfather w/mysterious woman from wwii ukraine sets on journey find her hooks up w/makeshift family buisness "heritage tours" that guides rich jews thru search personal history cranky old alex drives (tho he claims he's blind) americaphile grandson translates sammy davis jr ("seeing eye bitch") rides along (historical background not after nazi invasion soviet union mass killings were done by mobile units even auxiliary police pogroms conducted locals...ukraine was one such place)
just goes to show you what an upstart group of misfits can do a ell trained professional team if they put their heads together.. . like i said ifc films have redeemed themselves from last years farenheit 911 aclu debacle..
great movie!!!! ! i loved all the characters and suspense!! everybody should watch it , style directing was new different that is why .
this is probably one of my favorite christmas movies now just because all the hilarity . tanning scene so priceless !
the best movie i've seen all year . after losing my mom last and these being first holidays without her , this made me laugh it's an a+ in book bah hum bug to those that don't like it
awesome movie , but not for the chronologically challenged!! ! pulp fiction is right up there with once upon a time in america  .
silence of the lambs is high on my list greatest movies ever made . next to exorcist and shining , definently one best horror/thriller films anthony hopkins became favorite actor after i saw this movie because his performance was most breathtaking it's kinda had seen i've yet come across anything rival it(i didn't see hannibal read book thought it disgusting want tarnish memories anthony's or movie.) just so masterfully crafted every syllable word he spoke little time blinked moved eyes rare gesture made- although what guy damn scary that move stood perfectly still always gave observer tense sort of-when-is-he-going-to-jump-up-and-eat-somebody feeling you kept expected him do something like that...but never did not when anyway think scene with guards near end amazingly frightening almost animal a whole moving doing untoward likable even genius sociopathic murderer great line about census taker gives me chills day could write forever brilliant nuances lecter but i'm commenting as guess will have wait for another jodie foster too an excellent west virginia accent her heartfelt descriptions screaming makes though besides chaotic exchanges between clarice there actually really side story serial killer buffalo bill clarice's scenes in house were chilling they stay (as does amount things from movie) johnathan demme amazing job interpreting ted tally's outstanding screenplay such dark creepy air those few can watch 20 times get scared if haven't firstly-are crazy? ! live under rock ? secondly go it!!!! enjoy promimse
besides the fact that pulp fiction had all elements of a great movie done by an brilliant writer/director , it served also gateway to lot people . proved so many film doesn't require money be truly piece cinematic art and indie films were finally getting attention they deserved inspired host tarantino imitators create colorful violent crime from sublime ( usual suspects ) mere forgettable truth or consequences,nm but what is amazing about this (and hasn't even been touched on in slew reviews) with nothing sacred everything fair game ! accidental murder results name calling hilarious aftermath sodomy/rape comical bit where butch can't make up his mind which weapon save enemy racial slurs are used repeatedly white guy who consequently married african american woman jules (who breaks major commandment for living) recites word quote holy bible has shined light most taboo subjects made us not only stare wonder take notice one mirriors society's own irreverence
i thought this movie was excellent . had the pleasure of seeing it with some people who hadn't seen previews so they no idea what going on...but course those us did see pretty much ruined for but nonetheless its still a great lot action and , lame one liners...but you can't have an without liners right ?
excellent movie ! brilliant acting by samuel l jackson and john travolta . a typical tarintino film - if you liked his other films , you'll love this jules (jackson) vincent (travolta) are basically two hitmen but they seem to consider their jobs as quite ordinary (as witty conversations on way kill people would suggest) now have boxer butch (bruce willis) for doing something he shouldn't boss marcellus wallace there interesting things that happen along the takes out marcllus' wife mia (uma thurman) accidently shoots someone get caught in robbery thinks god rescued him from bullets shot at them  just name few!!!
will ferral plays in this therefore its not dumb u idiots .
quentin tarantino is an extremely talented director . the time sequence in this movie especially interesting great acting by all film
i liked it better than house of 1000 corpses
tarantino's masterpiece is brilliantly put together . the sheer brilliance of breaking up story in such a way completely invonceivable samual jackson gives great performance and compliments good cast this original real ignore imitators
my all time favorite movie . hard core modern day mafia by genius director , quentin tarantino how can you go wrong with a cast like that ? complex story lines are key
just like the movie exclaims , "unraveling truth about michael moore's fahreheit 9-11." in this documentary you will hear from many people including those who never even knew they were mike's !
the truth is a breath of fresh air , in liberal lies ifested environment . great docomentary!! !
the best of moore's feature films . a very dismaying and heartbreaking expose remorseless uncaring nature corporate decision making , failure those supposedly in charge auto industry to protect their companies workers towns they operated for sake bottomline just shows you that it doesn't take much way brains make money short-sightedness greed so-called minds our leadership usually results killing goose lays golden eggs what was truly reprehensible this film absolute arrogance self-centered attitudes putative leaders town these money-grubbing scumbags should have bones rammed up collective butts so dogs can drag them through streets
yet another great movie for the john travolta fan . with cameos by bruce willis and a host of other actors , pulp fiction uses destruction swearing death to portray remarkably entertaining samuel l jackson also provides strong character delivers lines that everyone will has been saying not weak at heart !
moore is great ! he's less a filmmaker than he someone who exposes things for what they are . may be america's most valuable citizen because cares enough to make his case and in culture that has 48-hour memory span , documents our world all time
"trekkies" is a rather endearing portrait of star trek fandom . pretty much as you'd expect , this means lots interviews with omnipresently costumed obsessives whose living rooms perfectly resemble the bridge enterprise however most entertaining reflections on come from experiences actors themselves brent spiner and denise crosby comment spookily realistic naked portraits sent by fans john de lancie recounts people confronting him street to ask if he can really resurrect dead nichelle nichols talks how young girl once saw her television at time when black actresses in important roles were virtually non-existent was inspired pursue an acting career herself that girl's name whoopi goldberg it's feel-good stories like make film so pleasant whilst being merely popular franchise has always espoused fundamentally good moral messages sexual racial equality acceptance diversity ideal working for purpose fulfillment than simple monetary gain though often satirical basically presents idea trekkies have absorbed amongst advanced knowledge klingon linguistics penchant wearing pointy ears some axioms live
i can't believe nobody has commented on this doc . they let the camera do talking , those conventions are something else appreciate hobbies that become cultures but trek world is truly vast and well nerdy whole bit with "commander" was just too much i'd piss myself laughing if anybody demanded address them by their startfleet rank
i was reading through some of the comments below and they said things along lines "oh this a terrible movie because it just michael moore's opinion is wrong he lied." news flash : supposed to be . which why made as much you say that lied presented biased information , balancing out for media in my more than moore turn on fox good laugh about part him comparing deaths by gunfire us other countries maybe would have been afective if had done percentage population but havn't already figured 11,000 something higher 20 japan documentary excellent points agreed with most what not only nice watch at times incredibly funny others were very emotional millions off it's people liked
i love the commentary . like how he suggests that us government is responsible for promoting violence as a means to solve problems rather than marilyn manson uses canada much better farnhiet 9-11 no matter many guns go off in toronto , it will never be detroit
carp all you want about the man and his movies--but moore did try to warn america . yet more than half voted for sh*thead bush even after this not-seen-broadly-enough movie now see how true film portriat was--a pompous , stupid clueless uncaring is dragging us down we "get" three miserable years of it.. thanks trying michael..
what confuses me is why this in the action section when it should be horror ? strange . anyways , has got to one of best tales ever made for screen ! foster hopkins are excellent as demme's direction atmosphere good tension unbearable and all it's praise well-deserved movie
a quentin tarartino classic turned cult film , which has it all . pulp fiction starring samuel l jackson and john travolta features some extremely good acting directing is movie that destined to be so full of action suspense you can't only see once
it hits the mark , is right about everything,america wake up! !
i think those kids in co needed to get laid . that would have given them something live for and love it is a shame - feel sorry anyone who could do hmmm...the kkk was banned 1871 , the nra formed very interesting patriotism virtue of viscous
i am an australian and hvae juts watched 'bowlinf for columbine . think that moore has done a fantastic job of this documentary was shocked aboslutely stunned disgusted the way americans go around with guns is very wrong found it emotional , right fully so scene from inside high were enough to make me cry how disgraceful tat such hting could happen ! whjat america doing happen? know many americas are angry at being portayed in negative but please deal most you decent people anyone who agrees what charles heston did going promote day after shooting also where six yera old innocent girl shot be all happy hahaa own gun its great blah totally unaccpetable disrespectful waste life man gave money saddam hussein osama bin laden well whats happening now?!?! ? oh we hate kill they murderers.. weel take look mirror!! abosolutely disgusting whether claims true or not wil admit maybe too interetsed he stil opened my eyes things wihs close on again wants do dot open them!!!! your laws stricter! save children love (also trucs had 'we them!) thankyou mr 'bowling columine' truly amazing
what a great documentary!! ! this film is insightful , provocative funny and profound all at the same time . i love how moore makes connection between guns fear in us based on history lack of social safety net propaganda that fans flames respect him for having courage to come out say things need be said genius do it way combines investigative reporting political activism prankster trickery
moore is great ! he's less a filmmaker than he someone who exposes things for what they are . may be america's most valuable citizen because cares enough to make his case and in culture that has 48-hour memory span , documents our world all time
this movie was great . it able to mix drama and comedy in the perfect combination trippy yet kept you thinking acting story lines best part would have be when john travolta wears banana slugs (ucsc) t-shirt
i thought this movie was funny . he actually had 3 teams of fact checkers and 2 lawyors go through the whole to assert everything do however agree with uses his biased opinion present information but that's what film makers don't says , we need someone like oppose common belief open minds in our society hey it won an oscar can't have been that bad very entertaining no it's not about guns ultimately us being a culture fear guess guys i'm from australia i've lived for years now is right
to be honest , the facts that were raised does not surprise me at all considering some of comments i have read about gun control on this very website.... . thought film was well presented and definately provoking bigbaby yes michael moore is making money out things like but fact he bringing attention subjects should mean your government sort it pump where its needed why ? didn't create awful situation
my opinion is : i live in canada , totaly agree with mr.moore on the gun control use their ethics compared to canadains how people fear,ect . blame most of it media (everytime you turn around talking about guns,killings,stabings and be prepared for things that are slim happing,i'm not saying they wont just take out control)and bush... well he puts fear god!! ! what hell does think he's doing?? ? trys make worse then really anyways..i loved movie rocks!!go moore!!
it may be shocking at times , but i believe is people like michael moore who keep america thinking . we need extreme shamelessly curious mr to balance the mega-conservative right-wing in this country how wonderful was see crusaders charleton heston squirming with discomfort moore's in-your-face can't-get-away questioning questions that's what's so important about movie makes us think confronts subjects often deny shows danger of not examining even most unpleasant aspects our american society
a though-provoking documentary from such an unexpected place to find something like this as inside usa itself . however , call it comedy movie is not only silly but plain disrespectful especially towards all those men and women that have been killed by guns owned american citizens or even foreigners..
loved the movie , it's exactly what we need right now : introspection . looking at our own society and talking about ways that can fix them more importantly to look how actions in past has contributed current problems internationally
this is the movie that opened my eyes to alternative cinema . i saw when was in seventh grade and it blew mind had never seen anything so original , funny dark incredible entire life at point door ideas making industry film one of best independent films our time deserves be recognized for brilliant masterpeice modern superior cast favorite bruce willis character ever because breaks his usual mold john mcclain action flicks highly recommended absoloutly mesmerizing a
i believe if eveyone saw this movie , the country would be a better place . truly made me think ! everyone should see
interesting that the movie is listed under comedy category . moore brilliantly utilizes a constant change of tone and emotion to keep viewer's attention throughout entire there not down-point in this cinematic masterpiece it departs from status quo hit movies today , acting as an expos america's culture fear directed thought-provoking film intellectually challenging person watching examine very society which they live documentary-style travels around country interviewing people surprisingly articulate marilyn manson charlton heston two victims columbine high school massacre capitalizing on themes his book stupid white men michael explores view african americans criminals menaces well major theme danger gun violence why occurs more frequently america than any other civilized he uses resources such actual footage shooting facts about brash reactionary measures taken by u.s world past half-century newscasts local evening news stories amplify point he's trying make whether you agree with him or undeniably credible keeps entertained ; created me at various points sentiments anger sadness laughter disbelief awe fact speaks volumes its merits effective work
perfect ! dead on in terms of it's political statments . really funny to watch at times , such as when micheal moore goes canada and tries figure out why we're not shooting each other also very saddening touching well i wanted punch charleton heston the face by end film
not a comedy , but it will definitely make you laugh and think even more . glad to see somebody movie absent of the influence hollywood washington corporate society in geneeral
great movie . go see it
wow--this documentary is well-researched and enlightening . only the extreme right would hate it , because violates what they believe : rich corporations should get away with anything everything at costs of environment animals consumers stock holders society as a whole i will drink soy milk or organic result watching this see movie--and be prepared to angry demand changes one most telling things about movie how dissects modern corporate behavior compares its attributes that psychopath grim stuff---essential viewing !
worth seeing . the enron story is an unbelievable of greed - not just by skillings and lays , but their bankers lawyers accountants customers investors traders there was so much cash being thrown off stock's meteoric rise that everybody involved content to take place at trough ignore ethics i blown away price california paid for enron's having lived through rolling blackouts a couple years ago had always found it extremely strange state would suddenly run out power especially in winter well turns desperate driving its convince station operators shut down order drive electricity up profit from increased prices more lucratively gamble go these profits allowed maintain facade financially healthy company businesses were cars crashing when streetlights went fifth largest economy world be crippled hours on end all could line pockets governor gray davis plead feds help regulating energy unfortunately george w bush is/was close family friend lay even recorded taping birthday video skilling no forthcoming (to fair fed position this issue obvious conflict interest made my stomach turn.) stunning sequences movie questioning how half states plants maintenance same time set against taped trader calls saying they need find reason little while it's ugly tragic as begins ends with suicide one beloved executives mention galling clip laughing imploring his employees put entire 401k's stock heavy handed makes compelling viewing
whether you agree or disagree with michael moore , democracy needs people like him who are not afraid to question the actions and intentions of whom we give power rule our country . george bush is supposed represent all americans included if were keep his mouth shut he would fail in duty as an american citizen
my husband encouraged me to watch this movie . i think it is a great because opens the public's eyes so much information that we normally don't get see unedited only hear & what government wants us unless dig little deeper kudos michael moore for making his mission and pass on american public
being propaganda doesn't make it false . besides , people who were voting for kerry going to movie or not and republicans are very dense stubborn - their vote is more about beating liberals than the betterment of country no facts could change mind they don't care if bush a liar so cares ? good movie.)))))))) ))))))))update know it's like ben affleck's sister saying 'gigli' was she knows sucked but she'll be damned givwe critics pleasure deep down all he worst president in history go bed thinking you say them will defend him at cost come on even that stupid obvious living great minds agree i think shame folks voted thus throwing our away basically literally spite damn we fall just rome historians future look upon this administration's run as turning point naturally dismiss comment morons that's problem nobody open ! trust me what jesus wants.)))))))))))))))))update against war most support one can give troops there would feel supported by wanted home die less right administration said casualties irrelevant now
great movie i love how the conservatives flood this one because they try so hard to dismiss whatever is popular , there are actually more informative documentaries but and amazing if you basing your rating on feel politically rather than it ranks as a documentary .
you guys have to remember - mike moore is a filmmaker , an artist . dubya the president of united states america some think that distorting public with this movie ? its ! gee i really alien vs predator people's view history planet bullstuff course didn't go war for political reasons they are monetary carlyle group has $800,000,000,000 invested in american machine...hmmm who's suadi binladen family texans+bushes tony blair... too much was phyisically ill watching (not just from seeing on screen either) but civilian causalties iraq oscar wilde said,patriotism virtue viscous if watched and were not touched deep down by uncensored brutality then true patriot
this was one of the greatest movies ever in my opinion . with quick action from robbery , gun shooting great costumes and it's all star cast movie had me on edge seat through whole
i don't have to watch a michael moore film or any major news network confirm what already think of george bush . all do is look at my own country and see that convicted serial rapist (iorworth hoare) won 7million in lottery win , students serious debt messed up travel ask where prime minister tony blair address these problems realise hes too busy supporting man who uses his power as an excuse exploit invade other countries didn't pose single threat the first place myself if war iraq was justified death toll anger many soldiers their families now question mis-leading information they were given whoever makes choice not this obviously scared certain facts are being presented them whilst make it habit apologise for posts event offending anyone won't be apologising one its about time we faced reality incomptent social inept present oval office has single-handedly assisted himself making only fantastic viewing documentary he starred but also some biggest blunders political history
it's muckraking...but first-class funny as hell muckraking . i love watching my pansy-president sit in front of children for several minutes (after he was told we were under attack) doing nothing talk about deer the headlights did care that might be a target thus just danger ? think to ask his own family too easy taking shots at this guy movie funny- and certainly far-reaching times
of course , like any other documentarian and activist moore misses the point from time to but for most part his three features were on money . fahrenheit 9/11 did make too much unocal issue was slightly off-base when it came number children congressional members in military service (moore said 1 is actually around 4 which still means that less than 1% congressmen/women have at risk being harm's way : interesting made this regard not a single member congress he approached terms recruiting their would give him day what great leaders we who are willing same sarifices common people routinely do!) belabor some points should been left alone out damning facts paint gwb flattering colors good reason included now-famous eight minutes reading my favorite goat here so-called leader free world who's supposed be so vigilant against terrorism stalwart protecting nation blankly sitting there bump log after informed our under attack now that's leadership decisiveness ! sat blinking deer caught headlights immobile paralyzed obviously totally unsure do looked heavily medicated as well another very how house saud prominent arabs through intermediary mr bath coughed up millions dollars bail young gwb's failed oil prospecting projects no wonder refuses go real enemy true sponsors also bin laden bush families bigtime players carlyle group thicker blood these financial interests family more important national security safety american citizens it's terribly surprising dropped ball getting osama or eradicating apparatus instead went off half-cocked lame iraq distractionary adventure anyone pans film accuses fictive grossly inaccurate one those brainwashed dimbulbs blindly allegiant moronic draft dodger fool currently drooling oval office get with rightwing touchholes total loser
he really did win for the quality of movie  , i'm still in awe how strung together all that information seamlessly . at end i felt betrayed by media who never covered these things and uses up news time interviewing other talking heads on their opinions cares ? about some facts !
all around great who-done-it type of movie . it was not your regular style gangster actors throughout the : bruce , john uma and samuel you have to watch more than once keeps going
michael moores film fahrenheit 9/11 gives his left leaning slant on the bush adminstration and , just as rush oreilly hannity etc. give their right those topics every day radio tv . i think is closer to truth there no doubt in my mind that has screwed us up royally cannot remember a time which was so much animosity toward america around globe do you know after were candlelight vigils being held iran sorrow respect for our tragedy ? we had whole world behind even went into afghanistan an action most americans myself included felt justifiable appropriate war iraq turned all of good will hatred it alienated former allies divided nation taken lives hundreds fine american servicemen women also ruined thousands others who have been maimed both physically psychologically innocent iraqi civilians financial cost tremendous certainly lasting implications economy what big reward efforts removal from power murderous tyrant whom already marginalized by gulf he posed real threat or people are grateful intervention behalf they attempting kill soldiers chance get put spotlight certain issues rather puzzling me such why delayed seemingly half-hearted attempt at capturing osama bin laden did shift focus al qaeda extremist muslim organization responsible attack secular state with virtually ties might believe answer questions could be money dont ascribe conspiracy theories surrounding relationships between administration saudis role large corporations rebuilding its prized oil reserves but can tell looks smells very bad if sounds cynical let remind corrupting played recent implosion friends enron opinion this become national must voted out office mr helps accomplish goal than hero estimation
i saw this movie over the weekend and thought it was provoking but very disturbing at same time . im interested in finding out what americans think about film & bush after they see , because don't understand why ever liked him first place guys a loser it's shows how he has always been failure wouldn't have won election if didnt cheat his way previous work experience consists of working for oil companies (go figure) which proceded to run into ground weren't daddy (his money saudi's giving dad years...um account shared with bin laden's) he'd be nobody isn't just there are alot other topics presented....the fact that nowadays strangers and/or foreigners expendable as human beings phrase like who cares dont know them saying or doing something you would feel bad someone knew/or cared too many people couldn't care less find hard trust anyone try differences between before realising plenty things common being greedy is more important than lives solider's sends overseas families bank accounts laden family....how on sept 11 flew 130 members family states while all planes were grounded instead investigating/asking any questions involved.(any innocent persons welcomed knew help) bout young boys/girls(early 20 yr olds) cool can play their cd's tanks killing (most time) disapointed when realised going army wasn't video game mean intelligent person these comments scary...this (this problem)(watch micheal moore's tell me problem guns america...anyways) real lives....it's anything wrong harming every everyone parents siblings love should take walk each other's shoes sure hell my enemy another topic controlled bombing iraq...hah not babies killed by bombs rockets reports american only die come back missing limbs (who hears stories tv?) could go here makes decision without seeing either we'll forgive naive you're probally gratitude give your widow half he/she deserves he's done sent fight war children....wow great president
this movie was absolutely fantastic . as a , documentary and political attack i honestly believe that anyone can appreciate it there were times when he took cheap shots at bush or made is point through innuendo not solid case but no one ever said film supposed to be fair conservatives are screaming propaganda (which histrionic because with the above criticisms in mind still uses pure facts) even if ; say its about time after all have 24-hour machine called fox news which lies distorts information tries passs legitamate disperser of opposition finally has voice....the true lovers democracy-true patriots voice ! hurray for michael moore breaking down barrier deception
fast food is like cigarettes...we all know they it's bad for you but i still see people doing it . mcdonald's would go out of business forever (hooray!) if we stopped going there amazes me that don't consider fighting to get 'good health' back on the menu
excessive ? yes . alarming most certainly funny relentlessly in this film , morgan spurlock merely drove home irrevocable undeniable and not uncertain terms something those of us with two brain cells already know : that 95% junk food is total crap (they don't call it for nothing) can be downright harmful to you if overindulge however obviously millions americans have less than when consider how many them are stuffing their faces at very moment the countless various culinary crapatoriums found every strip mall on highway our grossly obese flab-disgusting country used average waist size adult men u.s was 36 inches today it's like 42 dress women eight 14 lazy ignorant gluttonous self-destructive slobs they need a movie much more 700 calorie soft drink 600 super order fries or 550 big mac what disconcerting about (1) gained 27 pounds month eating mcbowel ; (2) he verge compromising his liver from such high-fat diet (even one own physicians amazed) (3) all feces bun even made him words girlfriend man sad scene featuring pretty but overweight teenage girl who citing supposedly healthy fat-reducing qualities subway (vomit) sandwiches bemoans fact she can't afford eat there twice day funniest bit ate triple quarter pounder almost immediately gave back hurling out window vehicle panned camera car so audience could see upchuck spewed ground now there's documentarian dedicated getting facts !
once again , hopkins shines like he always does . this movie was engaging yet nerve-wrecking one of the best horror movies all time !
just read : fast food nation the dark side of all-american meal by eric schlosser
i cited this movie in my rating of mcdonald's food not too long ago , so rant toward mickey d's still stands . but reaction to every one should go see it for their health that eat much fast since have seen is unlikely ever will again even thought buying a copy on dvd control late night binges trust me make you feel like fat american if are most all was impressed with the amount research went into its claims were grounded and arguments well supported (though there no main underlying statement such as dont food!) best part about has sparked neccessary change released mcdonalds loner offers super size meals am noticing more articles focusing an individual's portion meal know many refuse give up big mac fries urge watch really might your mind
this is truly a wonderful film . perhaps the can be criticized for being bit too anthropomorphic ; but even characteristic only helps audiences to engage - and thus more fully identify with these small creatures unfortunately , there now disturbing 'political' trend as reported in today's (september 13 2005) new york times both its diminutive heroes are heralded clear example of 'conservative' values conservative critics commentators seeing variety virtues such : 'the beauty life rightness protecting it' 'a strong case intelligent design' 'most passionately affirms traditional norms like monogamy sacrifice child rearing' winning argument theory that complex have arisen through random selection' 'some circumstances they (the penguins) experienced seemed parallel those christians' all laudable aren't really missing point ? an entertainment great at about birds cute cuddly still not people attempts tell simple albeit inspiring story mating habits one species penguin if makers had wanted expand into fuller depiction further habit penguins could been included less 'cute cuddly' social behavior which prone use whenever possible will maintain hole ice so easily enter exit feeding water course sense when sharks area intuitively understand until sharks' appetites sated or just leave vicinity it safe go however hunger motivator order solve problem group 'crowd' eventually weakest forced generally short time once fed left stronger again feed 'virtue' conservatives already learned from
throughout this marvel of a movie i kept thinking 'this is insane,' 'there's got to be better way'--what these penguins go through was somewhat hard watch : as winter approaches they wobble 70 miles thick enough ice for breeding ; then after passing off eggs males , the famished females walk back sea get food and come feed babies meanwhile 120 days with no staying huddled thru brutal pelting storms treks on 9 months year before going 'home' though sensitively handles dead stragglers prey chicks it will sad children--not that that's bad thing stay closing credits see clips how both panoramic close-up shots were taken . morgan freeman narrates
interesting for adults and acceptable the whole family . well narrated i know have a profound respect these birds!! !
great film with acting . quentin tarantino is awesome , as are john travolta willis thurman jackson keitel rhames best ! cast very original script and format good cinematography
one of the best documentaries i've ever seen. . and most touching disturbing it basically follows arrest (on questionable evidence) trial three teenagers in west memphis , arkansas for horrific mutilation murder young boys if you're from deep south you might be offended by all obvious stereotypes. although none them this film are created effect is life as really people question rusting trailer parks peopled folks on welfare wearing trucker hats ubiquitous cigarette butt hanging their lips sad smiles revealing missing teeth feel these embroiled something beyond limited ability to comprehend a moving powerful movie
it might discourage some to describe this extraordinary 2004 pbs documentary as "the real thing" about the events of a decade ago related in 'hotel rwanda' . and yet , there is so much filmed testimony that objective factual narration records allow viewer acknowlede objectively responsibilities local foreign parties who through direct action or inhuman apathy were involved tragedy one way another remarkably fair its judgment abysmal abundant human error an unforgettable experience
an amazing film .  .a great socio-economic , sports is merely a backdrop to larger issues
i'm not a big basketball fan but i don't think had to be appreciate this doc . it was bittersweet and felt true sadness for both of those kids
this flick should be shown to any kid that can play a lil ball , who thinks he's strolling stardom . keep 'em humble/keep the odds in perspective as far itself - it's great did not want it end i wanted following them after their high school days thought arthur had more potential skill but was raw little polish and he could've been awesome of course never chance though
one of my favorite movies . i love the sequences and how they go about with scenes not in order bruce willis , samuel l jackson john travolta are great
not enough is made of this . wow truth really better than fiction possibly the greatest story i know - and it's true ! haven't read book though should've done that first great movie unbelievable
really , cool . this was a great documentary it used direct quotes from the awesome book and interviewed climbers who wrote actually took you up mountain showed yout void kept me entertained entire time comes highly recommended
i've been waiting for this movie to come out 15 years , ever since i read the book of same name in late 80s . true-life story 2 british climbers andes 1985 who summited siula grande a 21,000 foot peak then suffered horrific catastrophe on way down that joe simpson survived tell tale is beyond belief extremely well-written and one might think weight expectations would make any pale comparison but delivers sticking closely original unique blend documentary narration by principal characters coupled with reenactments so superb realistic you forget you're watching touching void will stick your mind long after leave theater those rare movies sucks deep profoundly feel visceral shudders horror fear as unwinds do not miss !
one of the best documentaries i have seen.robert crumb was king underground cartoons 60s-70s and later-his art seen not only in papers publications,and featured his own comic books,but also made it on to album covers.his twisted humor went right core social satire.in this movie you meet him,his brother mother several celebrities he dealt with.it is both sad funny.after (who a talented artist)committed suicide .
this was a great film . i liked it even though r crumb himself is disgusting person living with mom , brother and what-17 cats ?
a well done , most amusing and revealing view of one the major figures american underground popular culture . main point film : dysfunctionality in family often leads to genius progeny usually engenders gross eccentricity boot when you see this can't help but feel so sorry for crumb's brother charles who was very significant influence on cartoonist
if you ever saw or even heard of zap comics , need to see this movie ! it follows the life robert crumb and his family . is stuff always wanted know about america's premier underground comic writer
a very fine film about true american genius , one of the greats jazz history . what strange character!! ! but magnificent musician..
a fine film recording the life and sad ending to of enormous creativity . monk is one world's great artists composers
good documentary with the real shane , love pogues opened my eyes a little he was crazier than i thought. . got to be 5.........
this is my favortie movie ever ! every seems to think that travolta was the man in , but samuel l . jackson bad motherf*cker also christopher walken harvey keitel quentin tarantino give excellent performances
a very good movie about man seemingly bent on his own destruction . music worth seeing but not for the squeamish
outstanding music movie . sarah share does a great job of walking the tightrope between glorifying and villifying genius self destructive bent shane macgowan you leave not exactly sure what to think - will he be dead in 5 years ? go sober can still himself however story ends , life has lived date is interesting say least.. if like punk rock scene enjoy pogues should miss this
i love this movie . it's so beautiful made me think that maybe there really is something beyond human about ali like how they had been waiting for the wet season long - then as soon knocked out foreman , lightning struck and monsoon started gave goose bumps a god great film man to all rednecks racist right wingers in general coward last thing he was not fighting pointless war f&cking crook makes you hero very well though story better than fiction
even a non-muhammad ali and norman mailer fan(like me) , can look forward to seeing them shoot off their big mouths in this epic,particularly given how foreman have changed since fight of the century when world stood still .
awesome...very funny
it's been a while since i've seen this . i just remember it being great guess you have to first love 'apocalypse now' if that , you'll - fact
john travolta comeback movie . samuel l jackson was also great in this cast
award-worthy documentary of the dance movements clowning and krumping , with both presented as alternatives to gangbanging . moviegoers are drawn into lives individual dancers including tommy clown who started it all music butt-popping dancing throughout highlight being a large arena competition if offensive language bothers you it's mostly at beginning not gratuitous christianity end also inspirational (rize) without sugar-coated ; plenty cause for laughing crying hopefully some grant $ job offers will come out this...and understanding hope
i have seen the movie it was a very good movie.ther are 7 other people how rated this way don't they say anything .
the best movie i have ever seen . can watch it over and again every time has same effect morgan freeman tim robbins do a great job plot , acting
another great director , quentin tarantino . i love the way scenes jump around in time think movies that mess with your mind are hecka sick
at first i didn't like it but the more watched got into characters and storyline how hope plays a big part in this movie . best prison hands down !
one of the few perfect films i've seen . absolutely flawless
definitely one of my top 10 . even though i dont care for tim robbins' politics , his portrayal andy was superb at first had a hard time accepting him in that role (in steven kings short story is small stature not tall like robbins) morgan freeman better the greatest actors ever and this best pictures have dvd find myself watching it couple times year just inspiration
if you don't like this movie then are a cynical b@stard...or crooked prison warden . will renew your faith in the power of human spirit
are we watching the same movie ? this is very good . great story line , originality and conclusion
this is a must see for any movie fan . great story , acting and music
a great work of art by stephen king . brilliant , masterpiece very well written and thought out the storyline is extremely tight & constructed this film should have won oscar for best picture but unfortunately it came same year as forest grump because was oatmeal masses could be digested easily when i saw shawshank redemption in new york city you hear pin drop that's how captivating story sadistic prison guard captain beat inmate to death audience's eyes were glued moviescreen speaks volumes about feelings despair hope count monte cristo would been proud andy dufresne
steller movie , a must see for anyone and i don't give that out to every tom dick harry hollywood chruns . oh ignatius highly recommend king's dark tower series if you're looking good reading :)
the only reason this movie did not win best oscar was because it released same year as forest gump . tough competition i may agree with tim robbins politics but he sure is one hell of a good actor morgan freeman all time greats freeman's son also in played cons yelling at new arrivals near bigining film acting like had fishing rod novella apt pupil (also by stephen king) mentioned that andy dufrense handled stocks for lead charector story nice to see little continuty king's work
one of the greatest movies ever made . most cast did an ecceptional acting job however , morgan freeman and tim robbins stole show this is a perfect flowing movie in every aspect (plot buildup musical score stosphere ec.) cannot claim to have seen best all time unless they shawshank redemption
an amazing and life-affirming film . what's more is that it did not win best picture the year was released apparently didn't do box office business when came out but made incredible comeback on video title put some people off word of mouth spread became a bonafide blockbuster well-deserved great ending too
i rented the shawshank redemption because had taken an online survey about movies liked and disliked . this movie forum would then take my ratings of reccomend they thought like was surprised when said me , a prison ? sure must be mistaken well it loved tim robbins,was great as man who wrongly accused double murder he ended up in for decades morgan freeman also good fellow prisoner.i expecting lots violence to find out more how robbins character survived his victory end.a bit too long but
it's a great movie . john travolta is the best actor its got awesome acting and an plot definitely classic everyone who living should see this go on web check it out sexy people !
mozda najbolji film koji sam ikad u zivotu pogledala...!!!!!! !
the best movie that has been made in my lifetime ! a masterpiece .
this movie is amazing . it one of the best movies ever made , and my favourite all time
this movie is with out a dout the greatist move of all time , will chang you for ever after watch it !
the best academy award-winning flick of recent years.possibly prison movie ever .
what a movie ! just when you think ot ends it throws another 30 minutes at . anything else i could say would spoil its beauty any one whe doesn't like needs to get grip on life
superb well crafted film about an innocent man andy dufresne(tim robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and the changes he goes through while in prison . standout peformances by robbins , morgan freeman james whitmore bob gunton as cruel warden movie has rightly become a modern classic
an excellent and inspirational story . my favorite actor , morgan freeman stars in this film it's one of the few that i can watch more than once
a movie with miracle . this is make-you-feel good will give in courage life it tells you that miracles do happen , but it's not something we get just by sitting there and wanting to come have work hard always believe the things you're doing i mean after all some magical thing our desire thrive where want go if never up you'll eventually
i can't listen to the same song twice in a row without getting headache but can watch this movie over and .
excellent story of an innocent man in prison , and the people around him . i enjoy this movie any time it come on tim robbins is great place his character with a good amount depth morgan freeman stephen king had
superb ! a life affirming movie with message of hope and redemption . morgan freeman tim robins as well fabulous supporting cast make this that will endure
a terrific movie . although some may find it slow , i say those people are the only that tim robbins was good in
movies touches a lot of issues beautifully -- prison brutality , business corruption religious hypocrisy what enables rehabilitation  the power keeping hope and believing in oneself . very inspiring teaches some valuable life lessons
overshadowed by forest gump that won everything year , but far one of the greatest movies made .
it's rare for a movie these days to take time telling story , and that's what shawshank redemption does . this film is very well written acted compelling from beginning end there's no explosions silliness just simple warm honest comtemplative with that brings the audience along it great ; you'll think ends too quickly
like all his movies , quentin tarantino once again gives you many different ways to look at a movie . in order fully grasp the concept must not only watch try relate with each character and figure out what is case
i never understood the hype about this movie until just recently when caught last half of it on tv . incredible storyline , excellent acting and very moving without being sappy script especially monologues for morgan freeman's character was extremely well written great !
an absolutely great movie . if you haven't seen it , you're missing out
one of the best drama movies ever
everybody loves shawshank , it's dificult to see anything beating it for the 'peoples' choice best film of all time . brilliant from start finish unfolding scenes when andy is sat in yard talking red just let out solitary confinement films close are as satisfying watch cinema
i can honestly say that have never heard anyone a bad thing about this movie . the message triumph of human spirit contained in it is universal and seems to appeal everyone regardless gender , age race etc tim robbins morgan freeman give fantastic heartfelt performaces along with their exceptionally strog supporting cast timeless gets right on every level - wonderful version stephen king's excellent story
by far the best movie!! ! this is kind of movie you can watch once a week!!
outstanding! !
this is my favorite movie of all time . i own the dvd and have watched it maybe 25 times family laughs makes fun on me when watch ve never really been able to determine what draws noticed that there are no women characters in other than incidental (the opening scenes where his wife shown , some jury last parole board has a representative house woman grocery store) thus interaction any substance between men not usually somehow isolation introspection by seems important plot criticisms movies such as do things nonsensical something requires 1000-to-one odds work works or cars roll over small nuclear detonation enhance scene but sr flawless ll read more reviews
the greatest movie i've ever seen . there's nothing i can say that hasn't been covered by other reviewers it's touching , interesting clever just a damn good watch this is could over and for eternity great acting plot !
this movie is twisted but ingenious ! my favorite part where christopher walken tells the little kid about story of pocket watch . i mean up his ass for two years , that's funny
truly one of the best movies ever made . i was few who saw it in theatres and feel better for having seen this cinematic masterpiece on big screen i've viewed movie countless times since released i'm still moved beyond words with each screening everything else out there is just a , my friends art
tim robbins is my hero . this movie rocks
this film is amazing and stunning . the first time i watched it was left breathless score beautiful , performances outstanding overall a truly brilliant little audience-friendly but who really cares when there great like
awsome , i can't say any more . a modern classic
this is tied for my #1 movie with one flew over the cuckoo's nest (1975) .
i love this movie , its my favorite of all time .
one of the best 90's
definatelly one of frank darabont's greatest work . his adaptation stephen king's original novel was just fabulous this movie really speaks to the soul , and people can learn alot from masterpiece
this is definitely one of the best movies , uhhhhh.... . ever entertaining and thought-provoking i saw movie then read short little story that created three hours maybe because already knew but was better than book not many do it actually made me want to become a penologist improving america's prison system
while the director's style may be disorienting , this movie has scenes which are very memorable . you must see entire from start
i consider this a perfect movie . fantastic writing , great acting vibe freeman is my all time favorite flick ! must see.. and do not let anyone spoil the big surpise
another incredible movie ! when i first heard what it was about , have to admit not eager see . rented came out on video wish that had seen in the theatre for graphics (wasn't any really) but just really get into much better big screen all of actors did such an job this film thought they deserved oscar
as much i do not like tim robbins must say that this is the masterpiece of his career so far . movies could have been another jail-break film but and morgan freeman ( rest cast inmates officers) carry weight drama with deep passion to point in which you actually feel pity for prision men scene where finally reaches freedom a powerfull memorable one kind rewind over
this is one of the most incredible films i've ever seen . it easily on my top 5 list favorite movies and were not for forrest gump , i think would have won best picture if you do so as soon possible
i think that this movie was absolutely excellent! , the way he seemed to feel like had nothing left and then as if out of nowhere felt got redemption deserved . it just soooooo good!!! !
this is one i can watch about once a year . it has to be good movie for me more than in lifetime loved the ending
i believe the shawshank redemption is best movie ever created . was directed extremely well , it has excellent cast and above all brilliant wonderful story funny sensitizes sophisticated an astonishing end - every thing a should have when first saw this very impressed especially from its that time manage to see at least ten times each again enjoy like haven t seen ; even things noticed before think everyone one if you yet go promise ll second of
you either get busy living , or dying . this is a tightly crafted movie have to see twice fully appreciate ; things learn at the end of first viewing change way interpret events from earlier in only flaw imho stephen king's stilted views prison guards (too cruel) and prisoners (many too sheepish)
i love this movie , it's got an excellent storyline !!!! !
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . it like four or five rolled into way story jumps back and forth between different characters comes together at end feel has reached classic status put tarantino on map
this is one of my favourite movies . i've seen it a million times and i never get sick all the actors in movie do great job keeps your attention way through definitely worth seeing
amazing movie .
this is the 2nd of only a few movies that i own on tape . for some strange reason i'm fascinated by prison , and one good very clever scenes ideas are charm movie it had happy ending
i enjoyed this movie . shawshank redemption was very well developed they put a lot of time into developing each character it held my attention until the end and had unique ending would definitely recommend
this movie is still beloved , i know . what a smart maybe the actor in described as bright young man when he hid hammer bible was impressed liked relationship between main and african american old guy it's warm
great movie!!! !
