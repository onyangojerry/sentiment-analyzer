boring plot not funny everything went wrong
terrible movie
way too much whoopi !
whoopie - painful as always .
sad , i actually do like adam sandler . he is a decent comedian but can't act and what it with his films ? they just don't seem to have any signs of cohesive plot them
adam sandler shows once again he can't act in this travesty that has him using profanity around little children and knocking mcdonalds . most humor is quite sick movie horrid don't even take a bribe to see it !
frankly , the moon is where i'd like both kaufman and carrey to go . stay
it wasn't that funny or interesting .
proving jim carrey and drama do not mix .
jim carrey can't act . is not funny as soon the public at large realizes that better off we'll all be
the image of andy kaufman as a nice , funny guy is shattered by reality . he mean twisted manipulative individual movie marketed like it comedy and this far from truth kaufman's life was not all fun games his story but sold (like kaufman) to public something
this was one of the only movies i have ever walked out . it is worst thing seen in a long , time theatre we saw accidentally played reels upside down and backwards that laughed were lucky though because at cheap cost us $1.50 each course still felt ripped off
i thought the stale nachos from theater concession were best part of this movie . it was a long drawn out film that never took time to really develop any characters -- not even andy and courtney love actor someone please get me another snack !
this is the most unfunny , makes no sense movie i have ever seen .
kirsten dunst sucks .
worst movie in the world...cheerleaders suck! !
stupid
kirsten dunst , your 15 minutes are just about up.. .
why is it that movies set at high school nowadays have to be sick . besides the attractive female cheerleaders and a few eccentric cameos , movie stinks they combine very gags profanity disrespectful attitudes fights obscene gestures easily one of worst i've ever seen
pathetic . goes to show how shallow the world is nowadays
no way ! i fell asleep about 5 minutes into it .
i gave this movie a one because it was horrible . just about cheerleading , and i'm guy need action
they should have called it stupid if not for alica silverstone would been a complete waste of time .
'clueless'...how appropriate...seems the producers knew it from beginning...any you airheads rating this movie great : of 10 million sperm , were faster??? ?
this was just another dumb blow it up movie . willis is a better actor than and would have to wait many years show
i think a brilliant performance by hopkins is utterly wasted in this scurrilous piece of trash .
just because there are babes in it doesn't make good . this was a true piece of sh*t from beginning to end..
my husband and best friend dragged me out to this movie , thinking that was all about t&a but it something worse--it a thinly-veiled chick flick ! (though kinda amusing see their reactions after the made almost worth sitting through it) . it's one of those little girl in big town trying make on her own kind movies if you like thing then go for i'll pass though
sucked !
dont waste your money on it and if you are at someones home who owns suggests to watch , even time! !
just because a movie has hotties doesn't automatically make it good--case in point .
ugly is right . don't get me wrong , the women are attractive but it's just a dull movie that doesn't know comedy take tip from frasier  emperor's new groove or kung pow and then we'll talk
wait a minute....this is supposed to be comedy ? i didn't laugh single time throughout this movie . in fact , don't think any of the others was with did either actual film it took make would have been better spent taping me scratch myself who produces kind trash
this movie was horrible . nothing new in , same old girl the big city only thing worth praise were advertisements
i don't think i've ever been as nauseated in my entire life was during the scene when what's-her-name jamming on roof to beat of neighbor's music . this movie long and painful , mostly because insipid main character like that most girls identify with kind thing
pointless feminine crap .
coyote ugly has no plot . the storyline is as skimpy costumes women at bar wear it's a poor attempt remake of flashdance and its major audience seems to be lonely teenage boys with access porn
this movie was portrayed on the commercials as a guys want to see , with lots of hot chicks and even more drinking . it turned out be chick flick about songwriter's dream making big not bar don't
i'm here to set things straight on rateitall.com once and for all . this is be my first opinion i go : bringing down the house , does not necessarily tell a story which outdated but rather one should embarass humanity into making its reddest face most solemn look of let's at issues tackled in film 2003 1)slavery 2)black (and white) stereotypes 3) cultural appropriation slavery officially ended over 100 years ago (to those born more recently right after gettysburg gods generals took place) as we can obviously see our day experience racism still rampant it white dominated media movies or general conversation confrontation what baffling me why combine an early 1800s attitude towards blacks with current sensibilities such artless tasteless manner steve martin's character his family can't seen public latifah ? she has pose their nanny accepted socially?...i even finish fact that movie was success theatrically just shows how ignorant are culture sloppy hopeless pile poo (note despite these have brought up briefly say began boring internet scene time any filmmaker who thinks filming computer being used instant messaging good way engage viewers stoned.)
to call the characterzations in this movie stereotypes would be an insult . thirty years ago have been out of date martin and latifah should ashamed themselves get involved with such a stupid depiction blacks whites really offensive thing about is that its supposed some sort social commentary
the parts that weren't downright stupid were nauseating . a waste of jim carrey's talent
i'd have root canal work done without anesthetic before see this again .
terrible movie , i hated it and can't believe they made a second one . jim carrey is loud obnoxious not funny more on the side of exaggerated gross don't like movies that insult my intelligence
this movie is surprising bad . jack nickelson a good actor , but even his acting could not save piece of junk kathy bates fine actress the only other bright spot in otherwise dull and unwitty clunker i did like monolouge narration for adopted son over-all was very disappointed with
about schmidt easily qualifies for my list of the ten worst movies i've ever seen . its incredibly slow pace , depressing tone and pathetic attempt to convey something deep made it extremely unpleasant annoying watch plot goes nowhere i couldn't find anything compelling characters i'm surprised note that this is first time haven't been impressed by jack nicholson kathy bates there's simply not a single reason movie
what's the point here ? story went nowhere , he ended up where started failed in his quest and can look forward to a lonely life with idiot in-laws . plus movie was just plain boring (seeing kathy bates naked didn't help either) real inspiring....
i rarely hate movies , but this one was awful ! the plot stupid and ending really bad . adam sandler is very funny when he plays crazy people in movie played straight man to jack nicholson just can't play normal
i hate it . you think it's funny , while not good is sick and kinda freaks me out the stupid movie can die
working girl has got to be the worst harrison ford movie ever made . is like listening talk for 2 straight hours it's designing women plot simple : sigourney weaver a mean and greedy boss of man woman , griffith in her mindless role
never even consider renting this movie - it's terrible . harrison ford made a rare mistake and agreed to work with script one of the most annoying actresses ever (melanie griffith) actually , now that i think about it he same 6 days 7 nights anyway is joke isn't worth tearing apart
worst movie ever . are you kidding me ?
not funny
finally a movie that shows mel gibson's arrogance in complete clarity . his ego maniac persona shined thruout this whole without ever taking break he has no talent , is very unattractive and couldn't act way out of paper bag if you can actually look around mel's inflated head at the itself it will just make fall asleep as lacks all forms entertainment needed any type movie...a should be missed i would never recommend it...don't waste your money..
i can t tell you what most women want because to be frank don give a flying fig . but speaking as woman , could have done without this farce considering his past success in the lethal weapon films will say that feel mel gibson has more than proven he halfway decent at madcap insane comedy however needs realize ability act nuts-o extremely well does not leading man light romantic make movie made it glaringly apparent was never meant follow footsteps of fred astaire cary grant or gene kelly is for part an action figure with acting who managed some admirable hits within sea okay if best so far career compared bygone film styles would forte been sweeping epic (braveheart patriot) almost painful watch clumped way through silly clumsily written game gender self awareness helen hunt on other hand after years fluffy tv sitcom and range apparently exceeds s by about 50% seemed up job even she couldn save pathetic ship full holes (a few her lines were actually embarrassingly stupid) semi-funny cameos likes bette midler much help albatross forcing myself stay awake flipped off recorder once again thankful had rented dvd rather having paid theater admission glad d gotten special discount rate signing new video store waste your time unless re major fan may only won notice smell
this movie was not funny it actually sucked  .
trash . this type of stuff is what rots away the moral fiber our youth trust me it makes partying stupid guy who doesn't take college seriously look like a king and kid actually listens to his parents huge geek i didn't at all
tom green is a cancer.. .
i detest tom green (the most unfunny man in north america) . the black fraternity scenes were too heavily borrowed
road trip is an extremly unfunny and stupid comedy starring tom green who a college teacher tell his students about days in what happened .
road trip is pure trash . it so sad that people feel they must constantly resort to this kind of toilet humor in order get a laugh bunch sorry actors who want be comedians
this movie was horrible ! it not on the same level as there's something about mary . did have some funny moments and would been much better without tom green he stupid brought down black fraternity scene pretty amusing
i'd rather watch 90 minutes of previews .
wow . people actually liked this movie ? amazing !
thi is the worst movie i have ever seen ! ?they should burn that to pieces think was a crappy
pointless child-like craziness . i could never even begin to imagine that this would ever happen off the silver screen
a stupid story .....no laughs for me .
i'm probably being harsher on this movie than i should because it's hard to reconcile its amazing popularity with the fact that it stinks , especially if you get sick of physical cartoon-like comedy after first person slips something and falls down stairs . not chevy chase making fall
home alone.. . are you kidding ? mcauley , how's your wife
you've got a baby ? in bar?? reese witherspoon movie??
don't even bother watching this piece of crap . watch the trailer instead it reveals entire plot you'll save a couple hours your life
considering great performances by witherspoon and bergan , the film is possibly one of worst romantic comedies all time . mcconahay (i can't spell his name..lol) perfect contender for next white trash smelly role on big screen i hated this hope you will too ta-ta !
this movie sucked . keanu , stick to the matrix make a ii please !
i agree 100%!! ! gene hackman couldn't even help this movie .
keanu sucks but so does the movie . you'd think gene hackman would make , he doesn't they have cut many scenes out of that story flow naturally very poor
pitiful .
so stupid and juvenile this film is ! i can't believe that was based on shakespeare movie too cheesy for me to withstand (and usually like bad b-grade movies too!)
martha , you have to keep old fido in the house . he dragged another stinky polecat again !
one of the five worst movies ever produced for a large audience . and there is nothing worse than having to watch it with pack females who think romantic charming isn't contrived nth degree desperately trying be quirky loveable good people diet because this film will make difficult viewer keep his food down on par superman iii
long and boring . i can't even remember the storyline now it was that
it's sad really.. . people watch that ? it had no real amusing points.. but my sides to hurt from laughing at the crappy acting...hue grant needs a better job
it's not the worst movie i've ever seen , cause that was norwegian film dis  but i'm quite sure 1999-film probably comedy in 90ies ! if there an oscar for actress julia roberts would certainly get it 1990ies we aren't satisfied with voiceless boring movies no action :-(
what a bore fest this was it not funny , wasn't any thing . just went on and totally pointless avoid at all costs
my significant other insisted this was a movie for me -- the reviews he had read were spectacular . wrong and so those reviewers i cannot recall much about long drawn out tale than should have gotten largest popcorn they sold meal would made experience bit shy of big waste time
the acting was ok . accents were very annoying swearing unnecesary and woodchipper part just plain old nasty save yourself time money don't watch this film
adam sandler sucks !
yet another stupid adam sandler movie with lowbrow humor  , profanity and no laughs whatsoever . you are under arrest for making a bad henry winkler can go we understand
the only funny scenes were in trailer .
this is the worst movie i've ever seen .
sometimes even the funniest actor can mess up with a movie , and waterboy proves this . adam sandler plays bored yet ? his mother cuts fish girlfriend dumped him came back coach is henry winkler
one of the worst flicks ever made! ! i suppose on some low , level this might have been amusing to a few but me it blew . hard watching movie where half time nothing happens and other time.. happens! plot was nowhere be found acting so poor that you could throw up (except for steve buscemi peter stormare) an unseemingly desire believe all scandinavians start end their sentences with ja or nej  let tell live in sweden someone mispronounce our language over hour is not my idea good
adam sandler really goes over the top , sending a message to audience of careless child care . it runs slow at times
this is one of the most embarassingly dumb movies i'd seen in a long time . and i even like adam sandler !
how could a guy who was so funny in happy gilmore be incredibly lame waterboy ? i can't believe spent $7 to see this crap . truly awful
total let down ! it stunk .
dry and boring .
worst movie to be produced in a long , time . just plain stupid
dull , predictable and insufferably stupid .
of all the comments made about violence in movies today nurse betty has one most violent (and unnessacary) scenes i have ever witnessed . it was so bad that totally ruined rest movie.this is no comedy!! ! aside quicky put me to sleep for movie , this should been a great lot fine actors (i love morgan freeman) and what very good story however scene little moment,ruines experience
i've walked out of only two movies in my life , and one was nurse betty (the other endless love to give you some perspective) . i went expecting a light entertaining comedy what saw instead graphic violence really terrible acting the movie is about waitress who witnesses serious crime has break with reality then believes she's an actress her favorite soap opera plot like that felt sure for lots laughs shock it see depicted very realistic horrifying way more (including blood gore) subsequent scenes morgan freeman chris rock playing killers after should be ashamed themselves their roles were definitely beneath them worst parts no theater laughed at any jokes pathetic ! still feel disturbed by first hour have been warned
my friends said this was the funniest movie ever . i watched it and had no clue what they were talking about an extremley dissapointing ending , such bad humor some acting by good actors
worst remake ever
yuck!!! ! i hated this movie! it wasn't funny at all . was horrible movie is extremely over-rated not appealing
although i've never seen the full movie , and some people will criticize me for making a comment previews heard about it . lets think they are devil look like sexy woman that is absolutely disgusting i wouldn't want to watch start far from attractive charmed these producers have made dark side you know what real well he ugliest monster in existance secondly hates all of humanity's guts (and that's biblical fact) was murderer lier beginning yeah may seem cool having this beautiful make but if anyone were really give their soul sensual pleasures pay big way eternity too not worth risking your whole over just get bit pleasure on earth why tries tempt because thinks everyone stupid enough fall reality two choices can keep $1 trillion dollars (have earthly be accepted into god's kingdom) or now which hurt back (give life lord jesus) one would choose judging by (keep dollar loose trillion) push my beliefs frighten offend thoughts plus seems arn't it's content morality message (which terrible) based lust (because attractive)
awful ! this movie is lame!!
this movie was horrible ! no purpose whatsoever , gruesome scenes and just situations . i can't believe people actually think of such things walked away from the with nothing don't care ever recall it again
god only knows what harold ramis was thinking.... .
it had canadian actors and script , which no one likes . the plot was terrible yet predictable
just a really ignornat , mindless romp ! will ferrell running around naked was embarassing .
this movie was about as intelligent a rock , and almost boring one too  ! i horrified to see vince vaughn lower his standards star in such filth . pathetic
wretched , unfunny tripe aimed at career dumbasses .
tediously unfunny scattershot comedy is a gross-out fest wasting all three of it's main actors . bad rip-off animal house with no merit
pretty brutal . i found myself braindead and tired on a sunday night , taxi with jimmy fallon queen latifah was cable watched it awful storyline cutesie dialogue tons of cliches - very painful to watch not recommended
painfull!! !
a retarted piece of crap .
this movie was gay
witness , my friends the crude of : i can see this movie being used by women for evidence to kick guys off planet forever . at least they should mindless fools like actors and writers numbingly-idiotic motion picture in what has be a record some sort over 200 (yes you read it right two hundred) uses f-word cataloged that's addition 150 other words makes wonder if there could actually any real dialogue course is none explicit sexual content so crass rampant that can't get into on honorable public opinion forum drug use rivals moronic cheech chong movies acting bad mean baaaaaddddd ! george carlin an appearance automatically they've even got kids cussing no child actor forced one list crimes brain-dead goes its sexist inappropriate music imitative behavior shouldn't replicate graphic violence disrespectful attitudes towards policemen worst all time sure avoid terror costs just go rent something nice family-friendly book play nintendo game or write story your own but whatever do pay waste film heed
such a stupid movie....geesh
spare me .
it is on my list of ten worst movies i've ever saw (or in this case slept through) . had all the suspense a half-hearted game clue jr. , story was meandering and wearisome sound quality dvd coupled with bad british accents made most movie mushy inaudible so painfully boring that we rented for whole week popped our player 4 nights fell out repose by time i woke up ending where they reveal whodunit commented don't even know who f--k got killed angrilly went back to sleep dig robert (i hate america) altman understand why every big-time actor has make an appearance must be some coastal elite blue states liberal thing
for me , it was a 1 . bad real gosford park is too long it's british period piece wrapped up in murder mystery 10 of us went to see # walked out 3 fell asleep figured and didn't care but if you're into the brits you really about charmed lives nobility can tolerate movie where very little happens then go on second thought ..
this movie was sooo stupid ! i dont like martin shean . nasty
lets be serious here .
this series should have ended before it even began !
jack nicholson fans beware . this is a waste of money
this was a comedy , thats news to me because i found no humor in it what so ever . its typical will farrel fare lot flailing about and badly delivered dialog don't waste your money renting the dvd just worth
a totally unappealing , rotten comedy that lacks heart--and mind . the isolated moments of wit (such as "when in rome..." confusion) are drowned-out all-too-typical stupidity associated with most snl alums raunch factor is quite high for pg-13 movie (including one particular sight gag was completely unfunny) and there not single likable character entire it competely lost me when kicked dog off bridge mean-spirited uncreative mindless--anchorman needs to be cancelled from realm cinema altogether
awful
i get to watch movies for free , and apparently you what pay with this one . along around the world in 80 days gods generals is of worst i've seen last several years it's just further proof that snl alumni are almost incapable making good anymore
a dumb-ass movie , appealing to dumb-asses . about as funny rubber crutch
this was one of thee worst movies i had ever seen . normally like will ferell but inane and utterly unfunny it not offensive in the usual hollywood sense too much violence sex offended that they tried to pass off as comedy..do wast your time or money
worst movie ever . take me back to old school!! ! pleeeeeeeeease
without a doubt the biggest piece of junk to come out hollywood so far this year . complete garbage all way will ferrel's horrendous acting never ceases amaze me , he just gets worse and every movie comes with is no different than other trash has accomplished thus storyline was loosely based on women's rights in television news christina applegate barely tried but i can understand why (i wouldn't do very good next ferrel either.) she must have owed someone favor otherwise would be able even willing star such not waste your time or money...it really awful..
what about him ?
vomitous nonsense .
drew , you were probably taking tongue kisses when 12 .
atrocious .
i would probably like this movie if didn't have a penis .
this movie was terrible and very disappointing .
a nasty film by director whose stock in trade is over the top unpleasantness e.g . fury de palma has to be one of worst makers all time , right down there with tarantino and david lynch if you want see how gangster films should done stick coppola scorsese
people , this movie sucked and still does . nothing will compare to the equally bad original one is exact same tale from only in new york uninspired lame
don't waste your time with this retread of risky business . in fact , rent instead !
crap movie !
whatever happened to the hilarious comedianne whom brought us comedies such as distinguished gentleman and nutty professor ? he now does terrible , mindless i spy adventures of pluto nash...and daddy day care  . this film is putrid disgusting only merit here a fun performance by anjelica huston rival day-care owner otherwise stay away it's like watching bad remake kindergarten cop
make up was excellent but martin lawerence is such an idiot . he couldn't act his way out of a wet paper sack
i can't believe even bothered to watch this crap . martin lawrence ? a man in drag it was stupid , disgusting lame suck dumb so many words you could explain with nothing new whoever made shouldn't have the effort.and is terrible ! unrealistic and simply avoid summary : film
i wish martin lawrence would stop making movies because he is really starting to bug me . this the worst one yet just recycled tootsie and made it black which absolutely pointless unfunny
i'm not a martin lawrence fan . i've never have been able to get into men pretending be women or vice versa , regardless of the plot.this movie bombed as comedy
how did this movie get funded?? ?
fell asleep during this movie . and i wasn't even that tired
crap .
another stupid teen raunch-fest . i'm waiting for a g-rated movie with teenage heroes..
this movie looks so boring to me .
i don't even want to see this mean , terrorizing piece of crap it's about making fun christians . and i'm a christian
another blood-soaked exercize is stupidity , this movie just as bad other useless movies (godfather saving private ryan) that push the limits of entertainment beyond decent . violence negative role models and profanity everywhere but a spark creativity or optimism nowhere to be found why would anyone want watch ?
mm should go blonde damnit
quite possibly the most embarrassingly bad movie i ve ever seen . didn t think jim carey could fall any farther down on my list of actors least like to watch but darned if he manage do just that other night when tried make it through this film not since ishtar have such a criminal waste celluloid don mind little mindless bathroom humor once in awhile s blatantly and appears be sole purpose renee zellwegger must cringe she looks back her decision become involved abortion would even flinch with his record saying lot
multiple personality disorder is not a laughing matter ! it mental illness people actually suffer from this movie just pokes fun at who do . they should have least tried to keep the humour tasteful and attempted raise awareness about that has caused so many pain
i was watching this movie at home . it recommended to me so gave a chance think is the most horrible , tasteless have seen in long time humour just way over top and left with sick feeling inside had stop once realized wasn't getting any better consider myself good sense of but wrong now that we gone far movies it's hard go back anything pure all about one shocking extreme next hate see what store for our generation goers don't recommend
this movie sucked donkey crank . yes jim carrey was awesome and there were 2 or 3 funny scenes but the plot embarassing (as though they making up story as went along) gags old over-used story-writer should be shot
this is the worst comedy movie i v ever seen.. . it seems that they wrote script as shoot movie.. love jim carrey , but not enough to put up with was wondering all time when will end..
worst movie i have ever seen . if you find yeast infections , vulgar language and men nursing off a stranger entertaining will love it
this is one of the most irritating movie ever . i think jim carrey need not to act crazy and get attention all viewers
very vulgar and without any artistic value whatso ever .
not smart comedy but stupid !
manages to make the first two , (which are so bad they my teeth hurt) look like great art .
i want to vomit just by watching this .
hated it
my goodness this movie blew . it got attention with that awesome beginning but once the started ? i won't even go there.. byonce knoles is to jive be funny in fact , it's friggin annoying next time hear someone say turkey or shuga like again i'm gonna explode ! not only goldmember sucks he gross stupid and also very squeezed a couple of giggles out me most movie's humor when one antagonists trying explain something while other person just sits there staring confused look on their face until done honestly feel they do too much fat bastard how bad his fart stinks says fashza stuff parts were mole subtitles (ha ha!) shadow scene than plain shameless advertising brittney ozbourne cameos obviously put appeal respective audiences let us forget biggest audience role them all : knowels herself good austin powers chick was vanessa she irreplacealble think i've seen bottom barrel stinker comedy
just see the first one . other two are like a bunch of saturday night live sketches lumped together and dragged out as much humanly possible biggest laugh was when ozzy osborne shown , for how dated movie will be in few years funny original they should have left it alone after that
three words (plus an article) : crude , rude and lewd .
it's the same thing as all others !
i can see why goldmember was panned by the critics . it's a really , bad movie my expectations weren't high to begin with but it didn't even come close making trip theater worth biggest complaint that contained very little new material worse old stale and pathetic in places plot revolving around uninteresting disgusting guy who ate patches of dead skin peeled off his body (i'm not kidding!) mike meyers' acting seemed forced choppy there no chemistry between him foxxy cleopatra female helper lacked fun silly feel second austin powers pace slow don't recommend seeing this or on video
could this movie get any worse ?
this is one of those movies that they should left alone . part two have not been made after watching it i thought , could waited for blockbuster night !
i thought the movie was very stupid , and it wasn't as good funny first one . reason didn't like is because almost feel asleep in theater while watching too long
almost famous was your fifteen minutes , kate...now go on and disappear again .
i hated this movie . even more the fact spent $16 for my boyfriend and to see it in theater first half of may be somewhat tolerable , if at all that's when funny things happen between hudson mcconaughy last is absolutely atrocious you are just sitting there waiting stupid characters find out whats going on continue with overplayed hollywood ending makers realize that they make a an obvious least need somehow different entertaining give us we actually care about?? ?
kate hudson is obnoxious , and matthew mcconahay sexy . unfortunely neither are funny how 2 lose a guy real disappointment
jennifer garner sucks .
oh god that was one of the worst movies i have ever seen . plot pathetic , and yeah redninefan,garner should stick to tv only good part music but doesnt deserve another star not recommended
i hated it .
i'm still trying to figure out why the director(s) , writer(s) producer(s) gave this movie a comedic slant .
this is the first film that billy bob thornton let me down , as did directors . perhaps they should have watched some noir before tried to ape it if had would noticed main characters do more than just smoke and ponder
i'd rather stare at a rock for 12 hours than sit through this joke again . i guess the only thing that makes it comedy is entire movie was indeed
i never thought a movie could actually be true insult to gigolos everywhere , but this b-rated piece of junk should thrown in the garbage disposal heard from again...a total waste time.. .
how anyone could give this more than two stars is beyond me . starring the only actor less funny and talented adam sandler
i hated it
once again , rob schinder proves he cannot act in another stupid boring and crude comedy that has no life it . over 20 profanities are present this film with the f-word being most frequently-used one filmakers please listen profanity is not neccessary to make a film!!! ! as you would expect from (so-called) movie about gigolos sexual content runs rampant graphic descriptions of everything masturbation genitals course alcohol drugs but i tell thing isn't : good actor avoid altogether hire some superheroes save world or galliant explorers go where gone before skilled trainers catch 'em all..
this movie is crap . and rob scheider general poo of the this-is-crap army if you want to see a stupid-make-gross-jokes-in-a-futile-attempt-to-be-funny i suggest 'scary movie' least stupid that genre
this is one of the worst movies ever made . i did not laugh once jokes were very cliche and dull almost like used to hear in elementary school really , a man getting his butt crack waxed funny ? humor rediculousely dumb point making viewer feel sorry for everyone involved word advice if you good comedies don't see anything by production team who brought big daddy or deuce bigalow are numb skull go check it out
wretched . worse than pulling teeth
william hanna is probably turning in his grave....this movie sucks .
56 million dollars! ! how , as a movie watching culture do we explain this scooby doo is proof positive that the cinema well american cultural landscape have fallen into an irreversable void from which nothing of asthetic value sure to never rise again . people took their kids ? take them museum instead!! heck at least go see spirit before seeing piece freddie prinze crap!
this movie isn't as funny but it gives me a hell of alot nightmares , and just talking about him leaves bad taste in my mouth .
please . all i have to say is jennifer love hewitt ? ugghhhh !
the movie like anything else to do with stern needs be given just a quick glance . loudmouth idiot too much airtime , legend in his own mind
uptown girls was really boring and the thing with spinning teacups wierd .
britany murphy is one of the worst actresses on planet . i won't tell you how really feel about her this movie was a predictable load crap like dakota fanning , but character such obnoxious bratty little twit could predict next line scene and it going to end don't waste your time or money dvd either
oh , no she's not  . the movie is typical cinderella fantasy teen where popular guy in school on a bet to make nerdiest girl hottie and he falls love blah if you like this kind of thing i'm sure you'll but i'll pass
isn't it wonderful that the idea of a girl growing up these days requires she dress like slut , bare midriff and have pants barely come past pubic line ? i no what this movie is about but once again here's child actor who turns 18 suddenly dresses s street walker . i'm so glad don't children
i want my $9 back , or i'm going to start cracking skulls.. .
i saw a sneak preview of what girl wants , and here is my review . this film contains the usual plot to reunite with her birth father in case lives posh mansion england coming from hip community america she meets dad wins his trust falls love another boy gets into catfight boy's other girlfriend over that expect (mostly) amanda bynes should not have signed on do because it's even below (oh god..did just say that!) really bad it could've been better amanda's fault though screenplay material actors are given both colin firth kelly preston aren't adequate screen time make their cases so seems like one-dimensional storyline for character plus wanders off far too many times there few limp one liners could everyone audience nauceous ! boy-meets-girl may appeal teenage girls but rest does click isn't
jack black sucks .
why oh ? i would much rather watch the original mr . deeds 10 times in a row , than this forgettable piece of trash
not funny in the slightest .
billy crystal must die !
i can only comment on the part actually saw , first 15-20 minutes ! anyone who raised kids like this needs to be shot
this movie is a total waste of money it so stupid . i was expecting to laugh my head off durring the and didn't even once plus fell asleep cause boring , don't rent one sucks big time
i waited for the funny parts that never came . there is another 'cheaper by dozen' movie one of old classics was based on life frank gilbreth family it cannot be duplicated and absolutely nothing like new promise if you want to see best funniest this a must clifton webb starred as father
yech! ! two bad the writer didn't have one .
what the f**k's fuss all about?? ?
well i saw a very small amount of this movei mabey thats good thing .
okay , so this was 2 hours of my life i'll never get back ! i'm sorry i just didn't think movie funny at all . laugh (or even chuckle for that fact) once it really appear to have much a plot the acting mediocre...but me seemed like they weren't familiar w/ their lines or directing bad something
was not worth the money .
within the last year this film has garnished praise from countless critics as best thing for indie films since sliced bread . so i went to confident it would at least be decent , but my disappointment wife and could barely sit through a few adjectives that quickly come mind : dull empty juvenile shallow meaningless self-indulgent meanduring pretentious wasn't like was trying learn meaning of life by going see simply found incredibly unfunny completely full itself...the whole time felt on hipster twenty-something mtv filmset watching them pretend shoot rather than typical experience what waste 16 bucks
this is the most boring movie i seen in my life dont know why a lot of people like there was no comedy and almost feel asleep during . if your tired then watch it will put u to sleep
the worst movie i have ever seen in my life . swear to god it made me dumber after first 15 minutes and friend looked at each other almost on cue said out loud what %@#$ am still shock that so many people this website actually like no-brain garbage
i don't see why so many people are raving about how funny this movie was .
seriously , the worst movie of year . humor will appeal to those who think bodily functions are funny lots akward moments
one of the most boring movies i've ever seen . fell asleep first time i watched it and when finally did rent again wished that hadn't what a waste long , worthless movie
maxine is the girl who's feelin' all right , thanks to magic of kid dy-no-mite! !
utterly crude , cynical sexist and mean-spirited film--like all national lampoon trash .
jennifer lopez is a over-rated , self-promoting bitch . and she sucks
maybe they should have consulted a movie planner !
poo
good lord--why anybody thought this movie was funny beyond me . the first in a long time where i ready to walk out of theatre jokes were overdone and cloying--most embarrased for actors trying pull off flop an enormous disappointment from mr stiller whose other work enjoy greatly
beyond stupid !
what a horrible sequel to funny original . those friends are such losers the kid from rookie of year is girl...way too sensative mia s and her boyfriend need be written out script...losers!!! ! only stiffler his bro saved movie
i found this movie a bit annoying and hope there won't be pie3 . is good message to with regards dating the band camp girl but rest appears rehash of first
is this the fate of tv comedy in ten years ? disguisting waste film didn't deserve to be made , especially into a useless sequel . these sex-centered teen movies show what teens shouldn't do whatever happened good old clean now i'm no prude but anything besides sex funny course it ! take look at beverly hillbillies i love lucy on or toy story 2 some like hot as far rated r which an underrate my opinion
this piece of worthless filth is not only a testament to the emptiness modern american cinema , but also cultural void sucking spirits generation youth . it unfunny painfully crude with predictable gags about (snicker) masturbation and people that stick flutes up each others' asses.. what ? resorts recirculations already wothless original continues in its predecessor's path dehumanization women glorifiaction almost pre-adolescent behavior extended into sequence praising essence male predeliction for pornographic voyuerism lesbians exhibits reluctance among boys toward homosexuality- they'll do anything watch two girls together there's nothing sexy film there offense on layers worst insult since road trip 
hunt for red exitsign was so bad . i hunted the exit sign , found it and left cant believe anyone falls this dumb over acted crap
steve needs to stop trying cash in on the market hype and stick what he's good at , movies aren't his thing !
i was hoping the snake would pop out of screen and put us our misery.. .
this guy is an absolute moron . i can't believe the way in which he treats animals encounters saw episode where her slams a boar on to ground by it's head what kind of act that am appauled at amount support gets from his viewers one day really gonna get hurt and it will look good him disgusted viewer
let me start off my review by posing a simple question : why in the hell has this movie been considered comedy classic for 25 freakin' years? ! all so-called humor consists of sex and d**k jokes , none which rise above kind thing i heard high school . don't get wrong i'm not prude can very much enjoy raunchy sexual when it's done well but couldn't belive how wholly unfunny "porky's" was it entertaining way- wasn't bored it- aside from one or two moments that made chuckle there just anything funny about become cult favorite is regarded as 80s i'll never know if you want to see genuinely era try "national lampoon's vacation" skip crap
sophomoric from beginning to end . animal house wantabe
it was terrible back when first came out and hasn't aged well . stupid potty jokes sexual humour this flick is childish immaute just plain dumb i am sorry wasted 90 minutes of my life on crap
perhaps the origin of all stupid teen comedies today . full sexual content and profanity , course main characters are not role models at instead this mindless trash i would love to see more movies with teenagers as positive !
hated this one .
the tailor of panama , a spy story set in after ousting manuel noriega is really bad movie . my husband and i saw it yesterday we both agreed that deserved no more than one star plot ridiculous acting terrible pierce brosnan's character sleazy james bond wannabe was huge disappointment don't recommend watching this even when comes out on television two thumbs way down !
this became the number one movie??? ? how utterly embarrasing . thing which i will only refer to as donkey show should be burned movie promotes destruction of property , brainlessness profanity use and disrespect for parental bring-up make things even worse it had have over an hour cut out just r-rated gross crude lewd appealing lowest common denominator boycott see another great that is family-friendly instead ! jkooks haven't used a profane word in almost seven years consider myself quite cool regardless
i wish could have my hour and a half back .
other than seeing that purty little ashley judd , in bikini panties jumping 10 feet the air movie was stankonian and about as funny jet li delivering a stiff kick to my testicles .
to be honest , i haven't actually seen it . but have read reviews saying that they modernized (e g gwendolyn gets a tattoo) and ommited many of the funny parts play loved thought was extremely clever witty consider oscar wilde comic genius for this new movie version apparently is disgrace don't intend see ! ):0(
this is not a great tom hanks movie .
i'd have much more fun doing my laundry . a complete waste of time...and talent ? oh yeah...there is none ! avoid at all costs
this film is one of the worst comedies i have ever seen . every time think about movie.. my intelligence drops if was a 15 year old kid on dope would be funny , but am not.. so it stinks
i have never left a movie during the first hour until this ! terrible
rarely have i seen a film that was more boring or held my interest less than this poor excuse for romantic comedy . it certainly did not even begin to utilize the abilities approach usual standards of cast involved most glaringly apparent problem misuse considerable comedic talents billy crystal he barely had anything do say and what far below par on humor/wit/taste scale in particular , scene with dog distinction sinking junior high school boy s locker room julia roberts as catherine zeta-jone mistreated sister/personal assistant manage scream giggle every ten minutes few good lines but her overall character poorly written pretty unbelievable after seeing small bit insulting treatment she continuously receives from completely self-centered movie star sister you can t imagine would kept smacking silly long before point their lives so made no sense woman suddenly grow teeth fight back an lifetime accepting abuse simply because now ex (john cusack) m sure portion work writing directing just unfocused murky concept one thing know considering many past successes efforts combined give them little if any blame failure they very which
david spade is not funny
totally brain dead !
it was a peice of crap movie with that weird anemic looking kid- who im sure dork in high school .
i didn't like this film very much!!!it was too disgusting!!!also the storyline ridiculous!!!but also realistic!!!this worse than ren and stimpy.here are gross parts:drew's character nancy eats a raison with lysol sprayed on it,ms.connelly chokes chocolate,and spits it out nancy's forehead,the scene where ben's alex is fixing sink pipe,and accidently swallows tained water,and barfs in alex's face,and when they get flu cough popcorn bowl!!!disgusting!!!! !
a horrible , useless unfunny waste of time . it is shame with two great people like ben stiller and drew barrymore definitely not worthy
this movie was so horrible i am embarrassed that spent 90 minutes watching it . ben stiller and drew barrymore are out of control  .why would any one hire a hit man to kill an old lady? ? why even try the whole time wanted tell them both get themselves they were acting like lunatics simply because lady annoying sorry , but thats not funny its stupid
appalling movie . i doubt you can call it a comedy in the first place
essentially , it boils down to two 30 year old children getting into a fight over parking space . the only good part was when joe came his senses i expected more from tim allen
bad movie .
you have to wonder about gwyneth paltrow's state of mind when she read this script and agreed do the movie . maybe owed someone a favor
gwyneth paltrow should just stop making movies . instead of being a huge waste time and money
a view from the top is possibly biggest waste of cast in history film industry . gwenyth paltrow , christina applegate rob lowe mike myers and candice bergen form out best yet somehow worst it just doesn't work occasionally have chemistry but that isn't enough to make up for fact characters are one-dimensional cartoons living another world give cameo performances while shouldn't anything do with this
different ? yes . if you ever decide to watch this movie better have a 12 pack or gun because are gonna wanna get drunk kill yourself i watched it at the drive-in and cars were passing each other out of damn place
after seeing bring it on , i couldn't imagine a teen movie being any worse . was proven wrong by this dreck honestly don't think laughed single time in horrible too much profanity disrespectful attitudes sterotypes illegal acts glorfied and the end well shouldn't have ended that way is why tape high-quality tv (frasier cosby show happy days) more than modern comedy movies for called sugar spice there isn't sweet about
rather dumb...i dunno , i'm just not a chick-flick person .
thumbs down
yes , let us not have another please !
not even funny , the spoofing is obvious and overdone .
i have not seen a film this terrible since still know what you did last summer . is horrid absolutly the spoofing makes no sense and it way too fixated on placing sh*t people whether talking about pooping someone for sexual plaeasur or actually exploding gallons of fresh all over where does come from ? was never in breakfast club she's that felt like had flushed my hard earned bucks down toilet then explode me with only true moment comedy comes with...jesus....there are funny moments to force laughter each time something supposed be comical waste good genre spoof
i must give this movie the 1 star because it commits greatest sin a can . it's boring apart from an occasional south park style laugh , film has no point except to make fun of something without telling you why once get over novelty puppets trying walk may find yourself staring at wall beside wondering how much better your life could have been had not gone
started well and some very funny parts...by the middle it was getting less of a spoof more partisan . by end i thought had greatly deteriorated fans south park might like but will find limited audiences overseas where they not get satire.(obviously) all my american friends saw with were rather embarrassed
i did not see this movie and with dick dirk's review now read know do desire to , even though in the use of his delicate rhetoric believe he said enjoy it .
entertaining i suppose , if you have a single digit iq .
i've seen better .
