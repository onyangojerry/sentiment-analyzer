thank you ! finally a deep meaningful movie aimed at the men this opened my eyes in more ways than i could possibly express review . it teaches imortant lessons of love , friendship kindness,perserverance dreams and being non violent is that had me tearing up idea one man making such large difference greater movies belive ever made
i can't really do this film justice in one short paragraph . brilliant story (i'm embarrassed to say have yet read the stephen king novel) , perfect casting powerful heartfelt flawless acting and possibly most uplifting ever watched ! if you haven't seen shawshank redemption then so at earliest opportunity
so in a word- awesome . this movie both put me space and story created for , as well encouraged my reflections upon own life what do i need redemption how will create it happening or give into the external negative influences ?
this movie totally pulled the viewer into it . keeps you puzzled as to whether or not main character did crime he was accused of ending is terrific
this is one of my favorite movies . i enjoy that get so involved in forget i'm watching a movie felt anger when he got solitary for playing wonderful music triumph finally books and money the library even better escaped
my all time favorite movie . highly entertaining , active and sad full of surprises it leaves the viewer absolutely smiling inside out i love this so much
shawshank is my favorite drama movie of all time . a bit on the long side , but awesome conclusion makes it worth tim robbins and morgan freeman deliver top-notch performances in this feel-good it's not so that sappy just great good prevailing over evil experience
the all time best movie . hard to believe because there is very little action , sex or violence exceptional cast of characters extremely well written i have watched it nearly 50 times and still get excited at end
this is my favorite movie of all time because it brings hope to the audience in anything they face . main character spontaneous and likeable has a very good climax surprise feel decade inspirational
this is my favorite film . it symbolic , inspiring moving and pure art the acting exceptional i love cinematography themes of redemption salvation enjoyed scenes at end where red chooses life over death believe that makes a powerful statement
shawshank is an excellent portrayal of how imperfect the us justice system . tim robbins was a great actor in this he showed to persevere and think be patient for obtaining your goal
loved this movie . i like director love the twists in
all i can say is,this movie deserves to be #1 .
this was a really great movie with morgan freeman . the had good plot about justice and jail system also , how he finally got out or escaped in end they showed after men go to have mentality do not know function real world
wow ! written by stephen king , this movie was filled with drama . the characters were realistic it made me care for them loved end
tim robbins and morgan freeman did an excellent acting job . the plot was well executed script ingenius at end of film you felt good a solid scene atop roof with beer best
tom robbins and morgan freeman were great together . two talented actors one of the best screenplays i've ever seen
the shawshank redemption was a great movie . it story about one man's quest to continue living even though his life taken away being tossed in jail for killing wife , andy has survive long enough possibly get out or clear name
this is odd . shawshank redemption actually better than story that inspired it(stephen king's rita hayworth the , from different seasons) basically flawless in all areas
all around wonderful film . i love it and enjoy watching over again
definitely one of the best movies released in recent years . brilliantly written and directed by quentin tarantino entire cast is superb movie manages to both funny shocking a completely unconventional manner soundtrack great first time i saw film couldn't quite believe what was seeing that's exactly loved about it
one of the top five movies 90's . superb acting with a compelling script gives an indepth look into prisons post world war ii america displays power hope , it is good thing maybe best things and like all can never die oh yeah get busy livin' or dyin'. ?
this is one of the best movies ever made ! i was forced into watching it by my friend , and thank him everyday (well not literally) for with me . a touching movie about unbreakable spirit untouchable feeling hope wonderful even bought book while in london
this is a movie to watch with an open mind and heart because you evolve the main character . you're on journey him it's one you'll never forget of best films i've ever seen
this is easily one of my top 10 movies . tim robbins shows that modesty and persistence in bad situations can help come out on i fell love with morgan freeman's character for his realization conforming to the norms (e.g. , trying convince parole officers remorse crimes he committed as a youth) may not be best way reach one's goals freeman were fabulous match
it's kind of amazing that two the best movies last 15 years or so are novellas by stephen king , a man more well known for horror books (stand me is other movie) . shawshank brilliantly written and produced tim robbins at top his game but it performance morgan freeman which most impressive he simply wonderful due to number times this film has been on tnt/tbs i have probably seen never gotten old can't recommend movie highly than
a beautiful movie . i like it more each time that see one of those rare movies is able to leave the viewer with powerful message without coming off as preachy me , was person good intentions can have positive important impact on whatever environment in which he finds himself - no matter how hopeless or unfair andy dufresne touched everyone who came contact and many whom did not end made life for wanted film
fantastic movie .
this movie is awsome , i watch it my first time and thought was a very clever plot .
goodness , this was certainly the absolute best movie i have ever seen . from acting plot directing all way down to sountrack complete
everyone that i know has seen it have all agreed this is truly a brilliant movie...well acted , directed and written . everything
the movie is actually as good novella written by king . i am usually disappointed in film based on a work , if have read it however shawshank captured every essence acting was so exceptional that viewer feels more like they are peering into real people's lives rather than watching people act uplifting and inspirational with andy through step of his journey truly felt amazement beauty life he had always known existed
what a great movie . i didn't see shawshank redemption in the theater , and nobody ever recommended it to me so when rented one night had low expectations surprised quite bit easily jumped into my all-time top 10 list story acting are both excellent but think thing that pushes this next level is way inspires you without being sappy resorting typical ham-handed techniques movies use play on your emotions isn't fancy - just tells powerful makes really care about characters laced message freedom power of hope it's hard even write cringing imagine how tough must be make crossing line sap well regardless accomplishes feat must-see
great movie ! perfect example of how to successfully execute a plan . must buy video
one of the few exceptions where movie lives up to quality written story . excellent
a good movie and cast
great movie , a must see .
what a great movie . it resurrected john travolta's career and includes some of the most well written original material in recent memory you got to love conversations between travolta samual jackson however , this is definitely not for everyone pretty graphic violence but none gratuitous also incredibly funny with funniest moments coming as result soundtrack one best ever
one of the best movies i have ever seen . great acting , show
for me the film show us how damaging prison-life is human beings ! like in andy dufresne's example : he starts being a criminal prison no of character shawshank who get new chance outside prisonwall , become really free maybe prisonlife isn't right way to punish ?
wonderful movie and the acting - superb ! very thought provoking as well . it has a way of changing you view life our particiption in
even when i only catch the end of this movie on television am brought to tears . picture does an amazing job developing characters you believe in and rally for was won over despite violence would love see entire again !
and one of the best written scripts !
i define art as something that moves you ; can not forget . beyond doubt , this movie is a work of
awesome movie - almost as good the book . character of red being an african american , and morgan freeman nonetheless was a pleasant surprise that only added to fabulous storytelling rich filmmaking
a classic tale of human endurance
a movie that i think gets overlooked when the greatest movies of last 10 years or so are considered , but it definitely belongs in discussion . inspirational never cheesy
one of my few favorites which does not have a sex scene in it . is probably the most enchanting movie great depiction + portrayal people psychology throught acting/directing/cinematography
this movie was well-written , and the actors did a very good job . best aspect of that it seemed like had really happened
shawshank redemption is one of the best movies i've ever seen . it an awesome portrayal life in jail
shawshank redemption was really great . i would reccomend it to everyone
this movie is suspenseful and mind probing
shawshank is one of the few movies i can watch again and . it's just as good every time
when the hero locks himself in prison office and plays reconciliation scene from 'the marriage of figaro' over loudspeakers exercise yard , stopping prisoners their tracks transfixed is one great scenes modern movies .
great movie . different from most
what a brilliant film!harrison ford was awesome,as he in the entire trilogy !
shawshank redemption is an incredible movie that always keeps you thinking .
if god had not created dog,this would then be classified man's best friend.the source of all wisdom(well..for buisness at least)for men?...i feel no man makes decisions in life without first contemplating what the'don'would do a perticular situation.using quotes from this movie has landed me hotwater many times with the boss...sometimes it becomes reflex to apply quote certain circumstances example:after been yelled my boss was thus"i promise you either your signature or,your brains will on contract...."ooops !
this is one of the top ten american movies .
classic . marlon brando is perfect as vito corleone james caan hotheaded sonny was memorable.this movie done with class it didnt need violence and blood to make exciting well written the book just good if not a little bit better
best movie of all time ! it has , even clemenza's great red sauce recipe.. .
'the godfather' is simply one of the greatest (if not ever) . this movie has it all , and anyone who ever sat down to watch immediately pulled into world corleones for entire length with mixture storyline casting along light dark captures very essence what filmmaking about more art at its finest- magnificent!! !
when someone told me this was the best gangster film ever written i laughed in their face . once watched it , my mouth literally hit floor as heard laughter come back to haunt what can only describe a resounding you so is near genius accompanied with perfect casting clear settings and now very familiar famous soundtrack all aids detailed account of corleone family especially don who serves main patriarch he loves whilst trying balance criminal instinct inside we don't get see real until godfather part 2 - played brilliantly by robert deniro definitely worth watching
one of the five best films all time . it has many great moments as any film does
the best movie ever
the best of
this is a movie that any true and dedicated fan should watch . it one of the finest movies in terms character story ever put on screen superb performances by al pacino , james caan marlon brando robert duval john cazale more dark gritty violent way be just isn't about mafia it's family godfather part ii recommended to anyone who likes great art
very finely crafted movie , with not a weak performance to be seen . caan is perfect as sonny and pacino has his breakout michael this the sequel are possibly best pair of movies ever made third one however just mundane
it makes you care about horrible people...great .
i won't ever go against the family . this movie gets 5 stars from me and a place in my heart as one of favorite movies all time
i just saw it and am in loss for words . one of the best movies i've ever watched it's amazing !
the best movie of all time -- music , acting and adapted story .
this is easily the best movie ever . good action , story and overall its awesome
nothing better has ever come out of hollywood . an incredibly poignant story family loyalty and betrayal
best movie
i wish the mafia would put a hit out on callmetootie
this is one of the greatest films ever made . such raw brilliance , magnificent acting wonderful story script direction from coppola movie to watch and they did it again with godfather part ii ! anybody who gave anything other than 5 stars (maybe 4 ok) cannot call themselves fans movies music best i've heard in a wow film so damn good al pacino's michael corleone marlon brando's vito performances are stuff legends robert duvall james caan diane keaton brilliant as well see don't walk...but run down video store i recommend enough summary : top
on the list of truly , historic great films all time you may see movies like saving private ryan back to future jurassic park shogun citizen kane star wars or rocky . but no matter movie critic godfather is always near top in this four hour mafia epic.....never mind who needs describe godfather! ? it's filled with power and lust greed ignorance law crime a true masterpiece american film
what can i say ? incredible ! pachino and brando are genius together . a masterpiece anyone who has the guts to this movie is bigger man than me must see
this is on my top 10 list .
the greatest gangster film ever made . magnificent direction , masterly acting superb cinematography and editing music matches perfectly tension is palpable
i think pulp fiction was a awesome movie and quentin tarantino is one of the best directors in hollywood .
the godfather is mario puzzo's best creation . it being turned into a movie even better corleonne family was to good not be televised must see if you have very powerful outstanding preformance by marlon brando and al pacino
i'm writing this review for every part of the movie . so many things happen throughout whole saga ! and it's one few movies where at times i completely forgot that people were acting it was real actors amazing too bad don't have a drop italian blood in me ; remarkable film would make proud an odd sort way..
what is great about this film that it has to be the most perfectly cast movie of all time .
dear rudy , are you kidding ? the godfather well done this is one of best movies ever made . and move ie eve for genre a must any collection i have it in beta (a special editon that was reedited by coppala with 2 so story vito corleone told proper chronelogical order.)and vhs hopefully soon dvd
the movie that started it all . what can be said has not been already about this ? is undeniably best modern mafia ever made , and briliantly adapted from mario puzo's book al pacino marlon brando play their parts exquisitely if you haven't seen should
the godfather was first film that really portrayed humanness behind atrocious behavior of mafia . before this , public always fed notion mob a faceless foreign group monsters since 1920's marlon brando fleshed out character don corleone ; he commanded respect people around him as well audience : man who spoke quietly because didn't need to shout be heard ! al pacino handled part micheal with considerable know-how and his transformation believable but it james caan's sonny mesmerizing everytime on screen left you feeling anxious breathless played ticking time-bomb so effectively everything about sheer perfection from coppola's direction costume design i think anyone would hard pressed name possesses much gravity or contributed more our fairly new found perceptions life one does
i guess this movie was too much for dart to understand .
pulp fiction is a classic movie . it combines intensive action with dynamic plot to provide quality entertainment
i'll make you an offer can't refuse . watch this movie , read book if you're really bored stiff it's cause luca bratzi just stuffed in a trunk
masterpiece . gotta see it
this is a classic movie . i recommend everyone has it in their collection the corleone family great they show how underworld
this movie is one of my favorites ever . will make you think a lot
excellent . after watching it i felt like joining the mob
amazing . an intense journey the breadth and scope of coppola's work will draw viewer in compelling characters , a great story wonderful acting make this memorable experience
timeless classic ! one of the few films , ever that i can watch again over years and still enjoy it as much did first time . had all strong story line acting direction personal standard for rating any film
one of al pacino's greatest performances . shows the world how underworld and mafia work won an oscar
the drama movie godfather is best ever . it lays out storyline very clearly and sets up scenario for sequels story genuinely interesting
this is a classic of the italian mob lifestyle . marlon brando was at his best , especially for later years it long film that kept me captivated throughout whole thing movie left juiced and wanting to conquer world
probably one of the best ten pictures all time . incredible story , performances photography etc what about mr coppola direction? no words that this movie shows he is very apologies for my english i am spanish
if you like the gangsta' movies , this is one to have . of best ever al pacino a true original when it comes playing gangster roles movie watch over and
simply one of the greatest gangster films all time . it's a great epic with plot that unfolds in an interesting way it is movie i would never tire seeing and everyone should see at least once
i grew up mostly on the east coast and midwest this movie reminds me of my childhood . that is one reasons for loving it so much
the only movie that you can watch over and not get tired of it . every time i see something new simply best
the all time best movie . there is not one flaw with this film every detail was so meticulously reproduced that film's realism enhanced to n'th degree
possibly the greatest film of all time , wonderfully written script that allows viewer to see inside heads most family members except don played by marlon brando who has an aire mystery him isn't revealed until godfather part ii . acting is superb on levels and casting was done perfectly obviously modeled after mario puzo's novel but also contains elements milton's paradise lost portrays a devil figure cast out his origanal home achieves success in new dwelling he head organization men manipulates with ease corleone structured similar army demons as well being without any argument best mafia movie ever appeals human interest organized crime violence more than it provides look into american dream achieving world means possible
what a masterpiece . first , there is tremendous cast...marlon brando al pacino james caan robert duvall each of the actors puts in performance lifetime second storyline so compelling and well written right front your eyes michael corleone changes from innocent young soldier into head family third movie made mafia part popular culture paved way for future movies tv shows genre if you haven't seen this are only hurting yourself it wonderful
the cappo di tutti cappi of movies !!!!! !
an epic tale of family , revenge and leadership . this movie has become a part american culture fairly or not done more to shape the popular perception mafia then themeselves highly recommended
coppola is one of my favorite story-tellers
i think this was a classic movie . it the grandaddy(to avoid pun) of gangster movies , and portrays some important historical cultural points really great there were pacino parts
the movie really taught me a lot about my life and how to act .
this is the best movie ever made . it has all elements of life : love , family loyalty betrayal..
great , got to be a 5... . moving stuff
a powerful movie about both the horrors of holocaust and ability one man - any person , really which is part point to do something relatively simple change world . very haunting moving
i watched this as part of my english class during 10th grade . am a fanatic about world history , thought movie was beautifully made rather disturbing since had never seen holocaust previous to it that used so much detail i'm glad the school approved curriculum though
schindler's list was based on a true story . obviously the people who belive that halocaust did not happen will disagree with me... set aside , this film is beautifully done - steven spielberg lot of research into as i don't think anything in overdramatised at all it very disturbing seeing certain events but only reflects how life can be needed to something we should forget persecution any manner wrong
this story was hardly propaganda and certainly to any right thinking person it has nothing do with events today . however you view anything , two wrongs never one as we sit here in wonderful country know what the worlds media tells us i believe all hear or see
schindler's list is spielberg's best movie because of how he portrays a flawed character-oscar schindler-and his ability to positively affect the world during holocaust . liam nielson as schindler terric in portraying character who against all odds fulfilled talmudic dictum given him ring after being fashioned from fillings concentration camp inmate's fillings:whoever saves single life , it if saved an entire
this movie shows how genius spielberg is . you feel like live on the past by watching imagine lifes could be that worthless
probably one of the best movies you'll ever see . words fail me in trying to express just how powerful a film this really is
this is one of the best moives our time-a beautiful , painful and honest look at biggest horror in history . spielberg genius whose heart shines through entire movie marvelous actors like liam neeson ben kingsley just break your it impossible to not be moved by film
i rented this movie last night and watched it with a friend , we were moved to tears at many points felt the pain of victims hatred their adversaries . don't understand raters on here who insist making an oscar or religious issue for god's sakes these real human beings regardless what political ethnic background you have people suffered that suffering was portrayed in fair painful light am not personally jewish but nor blind happened before during wwii cannot believe some would twist beautiful moving inspiring film into outrage ! so spielberg got -- ? after watching think he damn well deserved
i think , although am slightly biased to comment on this film because jewish you can not argu the fact that it is a powerful and filled with bold statements such as girl in red coat appears at certain moments but its self which (forgetting what stands for alone) so well crafted,directed acted based holocaust irrelevant amazingly gripping truly amazing . will always watch !
excellent depiction of the holocaust . shot entirely in black and white with a few small enhancements , steven spielberg should see this as one his best works i was touched brought to tears movie no can truly understand horror but film gives idea shows worst parts humanity simultaneously
should be #1 . very sad but good
most meaningful movie i have ever seen . no has addressed a sensative topic with such openness , and sincerity beautiful
a must see ! we cannot understand where are going unless have been . this movie helps us immensely in understanding
great movie ! praise to spielberg for bringing the holocaust life . equal amounts of neeson , kingsley and fiennes roles a lifetime this should've won awards oh that's right it did...it was obviously academy's best picture afi ranked in top 10 all-time not bad
when i first saw this movie , not only did it bring tears to my eyes but made me think about life in a totally different way . is the perfect film holocaust liam neeson excellent and ralph fiennes also while he portrays very strange sadistic character at times didn't even seem like more you yourself experiencing these scenes
this film is brilliant , but all the best things have been said already so i'll keep it short : schindler's list a classic .
schindler's list is a well-made movie . it has way of making the situations that millions people faced become more realistic to it's viewers yes , quite graphic but only makes you feel what happening
excellent film ! i've never really taken spielberg's work seriously until i saw schindler's list . liam neeson's oskar schindler is my favorite performance in any movie artsy its manner and stylish it's presentation , one of the greatest films all time
schindler's list is probably the most authentic portrayal of holocaust you can get without being a documentary . speilberg proved himself to be director highest caliber and ralph fiennes liam neeson give stellar performances that haven't been matched yet but there few things really struck me about this film are astounding 1) little girl's red coat- some it symbolized bloodshed six million victims ; freedom in first scene she coat appear , walking oblivious unnoticed through chaotic streets like girl home from school care world when hides under bed her suddenly changes black white has become part entraped by dismal we see again on cart expired headed for incinerator- no longer experience horrors what going around 2) hitler rarely mentioned never seen he remains unseen force behind all evil observe screen result man rather than 3) i have death scenes more before particular one comes mind female architect concentration camp did notice how bounced off ground limp lifeless after was shot ? drilled something : realized fragile priceless life though forget time not invincible 4) profound character study schindler effects war someone at beginning money-hungry womanizing nazi sympathizer who transforms into compassionate selfless philanthropist guess anne frank right said believe good everyone. will always special place my heart just observed picture completely absorbed transformed !
this is the greatest movie i have seen . no other has depicted , with such power how one man changed so many lives around him i'm not exactly fond of movies violence or profanity but feel that a rare exception  direction schindler's list superb couldn't believe starts disturbing scenes and ideas could end on strong positive side had forgotten all about inflicted prisoners instead contemplated example shown by oskar schindler in fantastic true story recommend to everyone mature enough handle extreme elements see it again when you valor courage film
this is a really great movie . everyone one in it does job realistic and helps you to understand better just how horrific the holocaust was if haven't seen , should definitely see be warned though very sad
touching movie . very realistic and relatable to history found the visualization accurate along with plot historically meaningful
i can remember crying when first saw this movie . it created a feeling within me that made dislike injustice had simple and yet complex plot emotions
for a documentary drama sort of way this movie was very interesting . there were no dry parts at all because i became engaged with the jewish people and their emotions great educational to help you understand what culture had go through in order survive
powerful story . showed me the morbid details nazis put innocent people through it made realize i'm lucky to live in this era
it was a moving story . really touched me sad how people were treated like animals very realistic wonderful
a movie that best retells the story of situation involving hatred amongst diversity during second world war . although it is quite graphic with violence , there no other way educating people art history
touching , very truthful and wonderfully played by all actors . a hard movie to watch because of the deep feelings it arises yet definite must see i especially liked idea depicting some germans as at least humane compassionate jews were
the movie was very well produced and showed us a piece of history that is troublesome should never be repeated . it how nazis ss soldiers exterminated not only jewish people but others didn't fit in with their perfect race emotional although this based on an event evil , destruction holocaust full force
this movie was great because it gives a better , clearer view of what happened to the jews during holocaust . is informative and educational really watch for pleasure
spielberg's epic masterpiece about one man's discovery of his conscience amid the horrors holocaust . filmed in b/w to evoke contemporary films and newsreels day , schindler's list immerses viewer experience unrelentingly brutal camera never flinches as nazis demonstrate evil on every scale watching this film would be a depressing were it not for final scenes which movingly portray oskar magnificent legacy superb performances by liam neeson ben kingsley ralph fiennes combined with work that will studied classes years come
schindler's list is one of the best movies ever made . it shows horrors holocaust and struggle man goes through physically mentally to help jews during wwii , saving as many he could wishing save more beautiful imagery it's an emotional ride for all see
steven spielburg did an outstanding job directing this movie . the cinematography is wonderful most of in black and white except for famous red coat very historical shows brutal truth holocaust
this film made me relize how aweful it was to be a jew in camp . i dont understand why the guy hung he doing his job if that is way its going hang who put japanese camps cause they were fraid of them betraying or dropped automic bomb on japan
probably the most moving movie that i have ever seen . showing brutality nazi's imposed on jews in situations of made me wonder how this many people could been brainwashed to be so inhumane
this movie shows the saddest history we will ever know . it is realization that millions of innocent human beings were murdered i believe also portrayed how people incredibly weak to a hidden , sick power (hitler) thus should be extremely thankful live in diverse and free society never true horrors what these went through sometimes tend forget lucky are makes me realize everyday blessing was truly sad with most powerful message music composed by john williams added emotion film he came up such composition purely ingenious when played at my school for rememberence day assembly gathered around string students who playing silent moment remember long time
not only is this an important film to see because of the subject matter - it also a well-made , well-acted . i've heard so many people say that reason why movie won anything was about holocaust and how could you don't like ? well ; social statement or
this movie was the most gut wrenching , moving i have ever seen . it wonderfully done with just right amount of symbolism for emotional release nothing could be better believe that everyone should see
good movie to bring home the horrors of holocaust . also , it humanized so that young people could understand
brilliant masterpiece . a grand contribution parading before us man in his evil and compassion
great movie . it gives you a good sense of the wwii era i like fact that schindler was different and he fought for what right , helping to free jews rather than imprison them
good realistic , historic story/script . awesome cast and cinematography camera shots were amazing
what a sad , movie but it shows one man trying his best . though the scenes were so they could evoke bitter tears from heart wasn't in vain this gives hope that even most evil things there's
the movie was very realistic about holocaust . i like how they used black/white pictures to make look old it felt we (the audience) were a part of settings , costumes and weapons
beautiful film . it hurt so much that was good i can't ever watch again , but thought amazing !
such an intense movie . it's one of those films that is so vivid and moving hard to believe it could happen everytime you see notice something new , i found myself looking at the expressions on people faces not directly focused but in background whole picture i'm explaining this very well what trying say many camp scenes felt real like was a piece history way look old photographs stare details places no longer exist clothes hung peoples bodies looks their shoes pictures jumped life were able events before after shutter closed
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . it harrowing and brilliantly directed will never forget seeing film for first time
this is one of the most powerful movies all-time . more importantly , it important amazingly there are still people who deny that holocaust ever happened and each year fewer alive survived nazi concentration camps movie a reminder atrocities (and really doesn't matter if oskar schindler wasn't hero he was portrayed to be) keeps tragedy in public conciousness reminds us never let something like happen again sure quite long have shied away because intense subject nevertheless you seen an obligation millions died do so
this was the most influential movie i have ever seen . it educational and moving ceases to amaze me that people who went through are still alive wasn't long ago in my parents lifetime speilberg is an incredible director know so close him personally , makes even better
this must be one of the most painful movies to watch , and yet it's painfully beautiful . somehow it manages inspiring in midst horrific incomprehensible tragedy i didn't see theater really hesitated rent because kept thinking had just right mood handle something so heavy while that's true shouldn't prevent anyone from seeing film spielberg controls narrative masterfully if you don't know much about holocaust should movie is a great introduction
heart-breaking memorial to humanity
an very powerful , necesarry movie . thank goodness spielberg was out there to make it
terrifying and poetic at the same time , this was an amazing film .
one of the most moving movies i have ever seen .
the part of this movie that gets to me most is little girl in red jacket .
schindler's list was one of the most realistic , touching holocost movie that's been made . it's black white with 3 parts which symbolize life that is colored great !
this was a fantastic movie . very intense action sprinkled with touching moments
this has got to be the best film in century . it is awe inspiring speilberg did great work my favorite parts are 1) little girl w/ red dress , 2) when he cries at end realizes could have saved more
possibly the only time in hollywood history that a film sequel measures up to (or , some ways surpasses) original francis ford coppolla's "the godfather part ii" (1974) will go down as one of greatest films all . with his masteriece godfather" (1972)properly rewarded by audiences cirtics and academy coppolla set out very short order both provide follow-up prequel would do justice end he hit on cylanders most difficult job for director was cast an actor capable giving same sort understated yet powerful performance garnered much-deserved (whether wanted accept it or not) award marlon brando don vito corleone struck absolute gold young robert deniro so good convincing able win best supporting while hardly uttering word english tale begins present through use flashbacks allows audience depth study into makings family business lenths at which heads obtain protect their power al pacino leads returning members (robert duvall diane keaton talia shire john cazale...) sequences see seventies version dole heavy doses vengeance retribution who have continue cross line interferes family's "business." principals are again exquisite but i personally held rivited flashback scenes featuring honest hard-working immigrant learns exposure reality streets must take control situation if is ever realize ambition fantastic picture from beginning well worth endless repeat viewings era less character based more special effects driven we owe ourselves indulgence these classic may give us novels come life far engrossing than comic book characters feasted upon today
a marvellous movie , with an astonishing performance by de niro given that very few of his lines are in english . the rest cast is brilliant as cinematography and direction together first these possibly best pair movies ever made don't expect much from third however
if the original is arguably greatest film ever , 'the godfather part ii' also definitely among very best films put on silver screen . who can weave two stories together as well francis ford coppola ? no one and there thing that might make it stand out from even greater acting display with respect to al pacino robert duvall lee strasberg michael gazzo i really don't think john cazale fredo corleone gets enough credit gives performance of a lifetime runt family lions bottom line 'ii' every bit ferocious probably more cunning than standing by itself in moviedom however sits janus-faced its historical importance generations moviegoers are awed
not as good the original but still one of best dramas (and sequals) ever .
the best of godfather movies . al pacino and john cazale are outstanding
in a hollywood rarity , the sequel matches (if not surpasses) original .
much better than the original . it is more toned down , and takable performances are amazing i went wild for
who doesnt want to be in the mafia because of these movies ? callmetootie is no good .
an awesome movie by the don of avant-garde , mr quentin tarrantino . i do adore spaghetti westerns and martial arts movies (as does tarrantino) this film was a little tribute to both (even few songs are western composer ennio morricone!) david carradine is course star from multitude cheesy yet his performance in enigmatic measured intimidating but with sentimentality that makes one empathize him (which adds spice bride's ongoing fued which far more emotional then physical) uma thurman powerful she doesn't look glamourous at any time during often looks dirty sweaty frazzled wounded storied exactly type raw uncompromising image her character meant convey so say bravo ! it requires patience view fully appreciate film's greatest strength it's weakness scenes gradually build up tension ones containing oodles esoteric dialogue will bore some fascinate fans tarrantino's style ponderous nature originality something lacking hollywood these days supplies bundles what all qt's films rise above rest
i think every part to the godfather aregreat ones .
just as great the first .
as good the first ! just look for reviews of original , best sequal ever watch and second
not as good part 1 but still a formidable piece of entertainment . it shows vito corleone's rise to power and his death very dramatic desreves much more recognition
the best mob-movie there is . all of crew excellent , but de niro steals show as young vito corleone scene that micheal sees his brother dying one
this is good follow up to the first movie and i love it . would like see more movies
superb acting . the references to godfather i at beginning are masterful and show how implanted mafia is in american life great scenes between michael fredo killer montage sequence end(as usual)
i dount now sis film bud laik se taitel
better than the first one . not too many movies get original , but this does it continues from movie seems to have more violence which makes off hook
this sequel may have actually eclipsed the original .
the only sequel to outdue original . flashback scenes were so amazing (signor roberto trying leave office) acting was perfect as well directing
an absolutely marvelous film and one of the few sequels which lived up to original . movie is divided into two parts action goes back forth between part tells story a young vito corleone , wonderfully played by robert deniro other chronicles rise in power michael perfectly al pacino if you've never seen this do yourself favor rent godfather : partii it will be well spent afternoon
the best movie ever made!! !
one of the best films ever .
it is rare for a sequel to be on par with its predecessor .
the perfect vehicle for jack nicholson and his most memorable performance , bar none . he simply is randell p mcmurphy only one who dares to question authority of powers that be (mainly louise fletcher plays villainess nurse ratched) in state mental hospital where convicted child molester hiding out from manual labor jobs visited upon him "real" prison you'll laugh cry live die with disturbed con-artest played by reality appears much better adjusted than staff volunteer patients share wing psychiatric center
doctor- is there anything we can do for you ? mcmurphy- (holds up the naked-lady playing card) have her number
amazing movie . yes i know some parts had their boring moments but the 1 hour and 30 mintues passed by really quickly
one flew east , west.. . of the better movies ever made book is much than movie and goes into more detail this a must see for kack nicholson fans it will help erase bad taste left in mouth from about schmidt
probably one of the best films nicholson has ever made
good movie jack nicholson was great as macmurphy commited into a mental institution for being troublemaker he continues to cause trouble by disrupting nurse ratchets section of the ward . louise is cold controlling there are lot funny scenes and some sad ones well i like part with mac murphy makes friends chief were actors in this done
jack's charisma shone through
best ever of jacks movies.....5+ all the way .
one great classic . if you haven't seen this give yourself a treat i never cared for the title and it was years before watched totally surprised at what movie
believe it or not my mom made me watch this . i was like oh god but.. is probably the best film that great jack has ever if am mistaken in late '60s omg can't a movie can be so funny yet serious great!! !
i found this movie to be brilliant . was actually surprised at how good it , because randomly picked up while searching for films rent not expecting much from it's definitely my favorite film of all-time
yes - the best ever
one of the most perfect dramas all time .
the perfect conclusion to martial arts film , kill bill vol . 1
a great rendition of book . nicholson is amazing as randall patrick macmurphy it's to see him in this role before he became the hug celebrity today excellent cast and just fun movie overall
an all time classic emotional roller coaster !
one of my all-time favorite movies . perfect acting by a cast wow
the only film ive watched more than 10 times
how disturbing this film is . ten years after it's release , it can still keep the viewer on edge of his/her seat a serial killer (ted levine) nicknamed buffalo bill by press because he likes to skin his humps  kidnapping young women removing portions their and dumping bodies promising f.b.i trainee clarice starling (jody foster) recruited help find out why in an attempt gain insight into murderer's motivations interviews incarcerated psychopathic psychiatrist dr hannibal cannibal lecter (anthony hopkins) himself convicted series hideous crimes involving murder cannibalism doctor agrees but information offers comes at price for each piece gives her she must answer probing questions about herself past order see inside bill's mind open own lecter's hungry not mystery very early both thomas harris's novel from which taken we are made aware killer's identity neither police procedural mechanics detection incidental story's true focus as character film's central relationship between raises some basic evil itself nature printed page able deal with things much more explicitly unconstrained time or necessities literal presentation therefore what dealt explicit manner novel- do you think i am agent ? -is implicit far subtle ted tally's excellent screenplay conveyed indirectly brilliantly through interaction eyes any words they speak monster's finger suddenly human gentle just moment caresses hand woman maybe pure psychopath charge case asserts almost certainly falling love whom initially saw nothing than opportunity relieve boredom indulging little psychological torture well... acting uniformly everything writing down haunting score works together draw quickly climax blindly stalks dark basement while turn advantage night-vision goggles one scariest watch lights off !
great movie . the first one was purely a martial arts flick , this had some more spaghetti western influences
the story is a serious subject and there are disturbing scenes in this movie , however it also has some very funny moments ! jack nicholson was simply genius role!
excellent story and acting by jack louise .
i love this movie . jack nicholson is brilliant
great great!!! !
holy loved god ! and imagine , the book is even better . i liked than catcher in rye
great acting , story line very emotinal . i loved it
this is tied for my #1 movie with the shawshank redemption (1994) .
incredible movie . outstanding job by jack nicholson a definite must see i reccomend this to the older crowd
my 3rd favorite movie of all time . a timeless classic -scarface
fantastic film . i read the book years before had seen (i recently purchased it) of course it doesn't totally follow , but they usually have to be slightly adapted for large screen jack nicholson has such an enormous prescence and always seems a down out rebel danny devito was really good as martini didn't realise him because he smiling) christopher lloyd brilliant well nurse wasn't quite expected (after all she supposed top heavy) other wise man who played billy moving did stutter (if you want see in something else watch x-files espisode called 'beyond sea' he's prisoner visions definately deserving 5 stars
excellent portrayal of a mental asylum and the struggles people face if they are different . good reading , but quite depressing
this is such a great movie . jack nicholson my favorite actor he does so well with role if there was anything higher than 5 i would give it 10 touching movie- know could never get sick of watching
this movie shows us there exists only a fine line , at times between sane and insane . in addition what is considered matter of opinion decided by few people (psychologists) which can be dangerous for the time brought into institutions mentally ill showed terrible conditions primitive techniques rehabilitation main character also has his own delusions when he believes knows best what's mental patients trys to force them iont society finds they breakdown realizes some really do need institutionalized
i gave this movie a 5 because it put me in deep thought . was very educational and entertaining
classic tale from ken kesey's novel . jack nicholson gives a stunning performance the characters seem real and script is flawless
kb pt 2 was great . but not as 1 , which i put in my all-time top-10 the first had a bit more action (the bride's battle with crazy 88s greatest fight scene ever cinema) further music far superior did think it possible there 3-minute stretch where eyelids started to get heavy on positive side blood and cursing part over top ; actually could wife see also loked film noir treatment finally have always admired david carradine he does disappoint one thing i'll say uma thurman impressive both acting her mastery of martial arts can you imagine julia roberts bride (i can't do that where's cigarettes???!!) ms deserves an oscar nomination is ethan hawke out his gourd fool around kill bill were cinema loved it!!! !
a superb movie from an excellent book . not only is the best 1970's , it's one of any era
one of the best movies ever made (along with graduate and citizen kane) . but do yourself a favor read book first kesey's masterpiece is wild ride , familiarity complexity will only add to your enjoyment movie
one of jack nicholson's best roleportraits .
great movie . dustin hoffman does a job acting as an autistic-savont in this he deserved the oscar won
a wonderful movie . selfish young man finds out he has an older brother after his dad dies raymond is autistic and lives in institution rayamond inherited all the money.charlie kidnaps hopes of getting cut money they go for 2000 ride to california turns have savant capabilities memory counting.he uses get some vegas good side this charlie learns that cannot change.so change do what best him.this funny , sad heartwarming.dustin hoffman did excellent job playing i relative with autism feel handeld dealing fairness without making fun those
one of the only tom cruise movies i liked . dustin hoffman plays his role perfectly as a mentally handicapped man who's greedy brother kidnaps him from home that he'd been living hoffman's character is an idiot savant , in hopes he will get brother's share estate father left felt was rightfully they travel across country together and learns who really you almost like by end movie
uh oh , 12 minutes to wapner .
a unique important film that-if anything was underrated;probable the best performances by dustin hoffman and tom cruise .
i am willing to bet that many people have never heard of autism before , and give this movie credit for bringing it the public's attention . film is an excelent way showing a mental disability does not necessarily mean low intelegence plus loved watching tom cruise freak out constantly in ; provided real comic relief from drama
kick
phenomenal movie that never gets old .
having an autistic brother , i feel (my humble opinion) like no actor has ever done a better job in role than dustin hoffman did as ray babbitt .
really a masterpiece with superb acting by dustin hoffman . tom cruise was very good too it brought all kinds of emotions to the surface , showing what this mentally disabled man went through and how his brother helped him super !
another home run for tarantino .
cruise is good in this film but definitely dustin hoffman at his very finest . he creates for us a sweet little character trapped inside own mind and as harmless likeable small puppy the process we also get rare look into world of autism frustrations family members caregivers can come to feel movie with heart soul - tale two brothers coming terms emotions situations you t change my favorite raymond babbitz moment when standing gigantic window las vegas hotel room looking out on all lights shot wide from back looks alone head tilted one side quietly says , sparkly twinkly that me summed up much what great
love , sentiment change...this movie has it all
loved it ! tom and dustin both did beautiful jobs portraying raymond charlie . i totally believed that hoffman was like , even though he wasn't
wow . dustin hoffman did an excelent job this is another actor who can be whatever he wants to wasn't it dressed up as a woman for one of his movies ? that's what i admire most about the guy switch from character so easily think movie really showed talent public wonderful , p.s.-edward norton do immitation in rain man ..
dustin hooffman was fantastic ! i don't believe anyone else could've played that part as well .
dustin hoffman plays like an angel ! i the las vegas scenes :o)
dustin hoffman and tom cruise did an excellent job acting in this film . the movie really pulled me into their lives i enjoyed how they put gifts to good use made some money vegas dialogue was great , mr didn't end up with a speech impediment after finished is surprising yeah k-mart 400 oak st...
i think it was an inspirational work about friendship and commitment that eventually developed between the two characters . liked way were changes they experienced throughout movie
the movie was entertaining and held audience's attention . realistic in today's society had a good storyline i would recommend for every age group
this was a beautiful story about guy learning to deal with difficult situation and love his brother . i learned lot autism very entertaining
rain man was great . dustin hoffman gave a tremendous portrayal of an autistic tom cruise did pretty good job too
excellent movie . tom cruise and the actor playing ray worked so well together making this film draws in attention of viewer as viewer's sense compassion for characters sensitive side a hard working strong man is brought out by loveable character , his brother
great acting . script characters
this was a moving and heartwarming story about brotherhood , family loyalty love . i enjoyed watching it made me want to go home give my parents big hug
this is dustin hoffmans best performance in my opinion . and i loved tom cruise hated him at the same time didn't want to movie end
actors that convince an audience of unknown conditions , such as the autistic character in this movie deserve much recognition . rain man includes a movie's phenom is not relationship between characters or ethical issues it presents but incredible casting and actor dedication
for me , this is the movie in which tom cruise came into his own as an actor . and that a dustin hoffman delivers perhaps best performance of career rain man touching story young who comes to terms with autistic brother process grows up little bit
97x bam ! the future of rock and roll
not too often do you get a set of dual performances as great from tom cruise and dustin hoffman in rain man . classic lines abound , good feelings grow this movie i think it ranks close to the best there are
this movie perhaps was good to me because of my interest in the special population (ie those with disorders/handicaps or disabilities) . i work w/autistic individuals and an excellent portrayal what these people are like
the 15 minute journey into hell that was featured as american forces stormed beach at normandy perhaps most riviting and horrifyingly true to life cinema has ever been created . audience is right in there amongst carnage bodies are being torn apart young lives lost unnatural ways i don't see any politics played out here , just stark naked reality although actual occurrences of dday outstripped these terrible scenes a thousandfold from accounts surviving soldiers who were film comes closer than it's predecessors story secondary horrors lived on screen spielberg outdoes himself director visuals progression this great director's career amazing his budgets rise films seem grow exponentially
well written , sensitively directed and superbly acted . the portrayal of captain john miller as a humbly man school teacher who only wanted to return home his wife but never made it was very moving highly compelling my father medic on front lines in wwii he did make back returned with more than just physical scars ; something which talked about humble too brave war flims art imitating live what shame that has exist
this is a great movie , especially the first few minutes . you don't expect to start right there where other movies wait one hour it brutal and harsh but was good tom hanks pretty much everyone else did job i just not care for matt damon's part so looking forward see private ryan then that unthankful guy
i don't care what any historian-wannabes say -- this is a fabulous film . it's extremely well-acted (with the exception of vin diesel) and first half hour so horrifyingly crisp tumultuous that you actually feel like you're there for some reason , saddest part me was not dramatic battle sequences nor ending in which practically every character killed where graves are shown normandy perfect crosses stretching as far eye can see they all sacrificed much made cry
great movie . almost made me cry the d-day part was pretty sad
truly outstanding and one of the greatest combat films to date .
i loved saving private ryan ; the best ww 2 two film have ever seen . cinamatogrophy was excellent , acting amazing realizem of is right on and over all story isjust entralling inspiring steven speilsberg did a superb job sguad led by cpt john miller (tom hanks) that storm beach normady in one most horrific days american history way great putting you middle this horrible battle afterward sent special mission to find bring home pvt james somewhere german infested hills france while looking begins doubt if it worth risking lives these eight men save one.just an encredable leaves with knot your throut from beginning end give ***** stars content : strong graphic war violence language (16 f-bombs)
just after the opening scene of this movie you can already tell is a much larger scale w 2.great acting with an all star cast ; puts in middle one most traject days american history , d-day . whtie nuckly twenty minutes that day on beach cp john miller orderd to find and bring home prt james ryan squad eight men set out though german invested country france they start doubt there mission if still alive going toughest struggle have ever gone begin thereselves saving private worth it masterpiece definately speilsbergs best
should have won best picture oscar over shakespeare in love . pathetic moment academy award history..
this rating is on the movie only- not speilberg's politics . im suprised someone rated it 1 just because of anyway , theis one fabulous special effects are great story gripping tom hanks again puts a flawless act ending battle pretty good so's beggining with little battles in between must see
this is on my top 10 list .
this was a great one .
5 stars to the script and dialogs
no words can describe this film .
saving private ryan was the greatest war movie . steven spielberg has outdone himself  this is one terrific film makes you feel chaos of , and let know how it filmis unforgettable especially first 30 minutes where they renact d-day that most realistic combat scene ever redefined phrase hell!! ! with images soldier lying on ground spilled intestines a losing his arm picking up another getting leg blown off also had moving story line tom hanks leading squad seven soldiers to go behind enemy lines save james only survivor 4 brothers who were fighting in if have not seen yet need great destined become classic
good enough to make you want see it 10 times consecutively (if not more) . very sad movie one of the saddest movies all time tom hanks did a really job at playing his character as soon possible
this was a really amazing movie . it so realistic you almost feel like you're there it's not for the weak stomached as is little gorey in some parts everyone does great job and though long keeps interested all way through definitely worth seeing
actually the best movie and i have seen alot.i nightmares from first 25-30 minutes .
it is mind boggling the realistic effects in this movie . a highly recommended
anyone who does not believe that war veterans should receive great benefits be forced to watch this movie and maybe they would quickly change their opinion . incredibly intense at the beginning ! i had come out of theatre take a deep breath fresh air end movie.. wow
one of the greates movies i have ever watched . great direction and very well documented shows strength , wit fear in a war documents family love for your country
saving private ryan was one of my favorite movies . it a good war movie and had strong plots within the not just packed with action but also spoke to emotional side moviegoers little long , quality so i didn't realize been that
again , steven spielberg has triumphed . he is a shockingly creative man to take one war and create two masterpieces emotionally charged star-studded brutally realistic sparing no expense this makes beautiful movies wide range of people can enjoy appreciate movie--veterans veterans any students studying wartime children adults who knew someone died in the etc movie epitomizes unbelievable sacrifice made time by our countrymen keep country world free power make young peacetime turmoil their age superbly acted as sure all his films are though damon's part comparatively small it remarkably memorable fresh-faced youth almost painful see amongst such rubble conflict speaks better times with dead brothers heartbreaking tom hanks acting greats delivers an oscar-worthy performance i believe nation when tells private james ryan earn
wow ! this movie made me realize how not glamorous war is . everything about it was outstanding the acting a+++ , however directing incredible project had a dream team duo with tom hanks and steven spielberg will go down as one of greatest movies ever along forrest gump
a lot has been said about the opening battle sequence in this movie , and when i went to see private ryan at cinema thought was prepared - after all have enjoyed watching of films that contain violence it never really phased me . wrong ! think spielberg captured essence large-scale conventional warfare it's most real short actually being there initial fight scene subsided had remind myself breathe no don't is gratuitous wwii resulted deaths some 20-25 million soldiers that's how soften blow on audience would be insulting patronising anyway cast acts its way through film flawlessly felt for each every gi featured (the germans are rather faceless with one exception) again end grueling watch didn't feel impact diminished by having sat first closing scenes old veteran may find bit sentimental flag-waving comments montgomery were grating (i'm english way) but supposed from viewpoint squad not history textbook so can forgive overall best war ever made technically shot directed movies
nothing like it ! true original , mr . pink is a legend
shows the graphic reality of war . one best story lines ever awesome performance by tom hanks
i loved the historical aspect of movie and how it depicted wwii battles . also showed personal emotional side war by developing characters to get on a human level with audience
saving private ryan was a good drama . i loved the way it made me feel like right in trenches with them actors did job of making their emotions think really know what war because that movie this one best movies have seen very touching , realistic reason so much is
i don't know if give this drama a rating of five stars in honor siskel and ebert or my government teacher , mr . berry who would it two thumbs down for its ability to evoke memories he'd rather supress so excellent effects emotional draw sense reality but backwards from the ex-vietnam solider couldn't sit through entire thing without gagging real was stench death drifting back into his nostrils power film making
in the case of this film , plot is not as realistic and extreme scenery actions/words truth to era . i personally advise that non-wwii veterans see movie because possibly acting backgrounds are so it could cause recurring bad or even traumatic memories viewer trigger unwanted emotions from time their lives send them into tears fear one good side does a job showing just how incredibly influential wwii was gives idea struggles both military personal we americans had endure win what have been history's ultimate battle between evil
saving private ryan was a terrific movie . spielberg makes you feel like are right in the war costumes , historical background superb story about is sad he lost all his brothers and i could never imagine but it viewer think
perhaps the greatest and most realistic war movie ever filmed . opening scene portraying d-day invasion was so real overwhelming that many wwii veterans had to leave theater it concerned political as well social parts of very historical amazing despite showing intense violence , still a stern drama
though this was a gruesome movie , the message sent out very touching . to see lives die in order save another life is something rarely done and one that must have been hard do i can't believe they school teacher lead spared also took more
this movie was great , but a little too gory . it depicted the war and issue of trust backstabbing very well i usually don't like kind loved one
i thought that spr was great  , know there are people out dont like seeing getting shot in the head and dead but film showed what really happined ww2 think it just :)
the cinematography was so realistic , and action directed superbly that you felt like were one who landing on omaha beach . it packed with worked story/plot reached out to audience connected characters especially tom hanks last scene too unrealistic
saving private ryan is a great movie . i really enjoyed this beacause it story also based on our history the had special effects
gave you a real appreciation for wwii . really made feel the soldiers had on edge of your seat from start
i thought private ryan was a great movie because it accurately portrayed war and in particular , the d-day invasion . meant lot to me my grandfather fought wwii looked like old gave new generation reminder of how we as civilization got where are
arguably taratino's best film , this one packs in the most excitement and writing . harvey keitel is excellent as mr white steve buscemi plays a wonderful pink but tim roth real show stopper orange (freddy nuindike) tarantino make an appearance brown lawrence tierney tough funny crime boss michael madsen's cahracter get to have of fun (i.e cutting ear marvin nash captured police officer generally playing it cool) constant backdrop k-billy's super sounds seventies makes perfect frame for scene : are you gonna bark all day little doggy or bite ?
probably my favorite movie of all time up to now . a great plot , set in wwii and an off the hook cast not mention design production stephen speilberg keeps on impressing
definitely a good movie . it projected realistic view of what happened at war time , and how soldiers risk their lives to protect others
a wonderful telling of world war ii . one the few movies that doesn't glorify and violence , but shows it as our horrible failure in human society must see for those who crave heart felt movie
spr was a good account of history . i like , especially about guys in the military
saving private ryan was a great movie . the effects and realism were wonderful i recommend everyone buy watch it in surround sound
this movie was epic . how could someone not enjoy ? it depicts what might have really been like very lifelike , cool
outstanding film . it gives an amazing portrayal of war and tom hanks deserves oscar for it's about time wwii veterans were remembered in incredible like this
what can i say about this movie every thing that you want it in a is there i'll tell hapend with me the movies when was watching massenger man didn't help his freind swere one cienma show yeld and shouted to friend because all of us were completly living .
a movie has never effected me as much saving private ryan . i walked out of the theater in shock now have dvd and it is just an amazing writing directing are incredible was done perfectly
for a first film its terriffic ! the violence is gritty and ralistic he plays on your confusion about robbery tie you into cast . pure genius!
i don't know why. . but like this movie :)
best war movie of all time . others were good , but this one was great the story a little bit silly(having to save brother) masterfully done plus as far i know is only tom hanks has ever died on camera
this should have won best picture!!!! !
the sound alone was oscar material-make sure you watch it with a good system
saving private ryan is an awsome movie . it has a great cast , director story and special effects
saving private ryan deserves way more than rateitall.com's rating key .
i thought that saving private ryan was a great movie . definitely classic
graphic but accurate !
the story is so clever and yet simple . you can't help but like forrest who brilliantly played by tom hanks part of me would to see a sequal other parts says leave as it timeless classic that will be enjoyed for very long time
i saw it at the age of 11....i cried , loved . what 11 year old cries when watching a movie.....one that is truely moved by story line
bloody , violent and funny all at the same time . has a good soundtrack too favorite scene : infamous ear cutting you'll never think of stuck in middle with you way again after seeing it
forrest gump teaches you that anything is possible . it to experience life as was said like a box of chocolates...his momma some pretty wise things
what a neat movie . tom hanks did terrific job as forrest gump man who does not have lot of smarts but huge heart i loved how events his life tied in with meeting about four presidents has always jenny since childhood they grew up best friends their lives take different paths.forrest succeeds everything he , is the runner on football team was hero during vietnam war ran shrimping busy honor friend bubba and ending being millionaire.etc met awarded by them for reasons many times great special effects putting films real making it appear that dan had no legs like fact person very smart kind caring person.falls upon success yet money fame mean little to him just finding jenny[who fallen bad times} her important,i devoted mom dan.a bit too long
one of my all time favorites from tom hanks . he is such a talented actor
it's a wonderful , fairy tale story . just pleasent way to spend few hours tom hanks is actor and this great showcase for his talent ithe words of the advertising department tv land movie has rewatchablity there always something enjoyable see weather first or fiftieth time you have seen it
well , just call me simple and dull but i liked this movie . got a kick out of the sweet character finding himself in so many experiences he never realized how diverse these things were also loved his attitude thinking was more than what world can be wrong with story kind man some extremely funny sometimes sad moments
not just tom hanks' best movie of all time.. . the time it has every single thing you could possibly hope for in a hanks is one actors
by far tom hanks best movie . he was amazing this is what made him a legend sucessfull before the , but performance convinced everyone i don't know how often watched that it timeless an adventure definately in my all time top 10
it's always amazing to me how liberals miss the point of this movie- even tom hanks disliked character forrest gump . movie is simply about your most basic christian belief- caring for fellow man and doing was good- pursuing happiness in its rightful place it parallels lives two characters jenny forrest- dumb as a bag rocks- processes realities life forms no matter challenging became he did what thought his momma told him journey from crippled child enlisting military serving vietnam , having best friend die arms riddled with painful events that turns into positive experiences by good love also dealt horrible plot being sexually molested brilliant however ends up going berkley living fads era embarks on different path she becomes consumed fulfilling human desire eventually consumes her leaves perpetually lonely made here not satisfied prurient satisfaction but action virtue appeal universal goods transcended brilliance- part something greater end dummy fathers baby brings only solace before succumbs aids though world forrest's oyster where attains an improbable wealth uses continually do essence defining pursuit happiness- be free satisfying simple earthly wants or right reaping benefits ? view such constricted box they will consistently beauty like says stupid does
an absolutely fantastic debut from tartintino with iron clad cast and very sharp plot editing funky music to boot . its slick , violent keeps your eyes glued the whole way through i never tire of this film
an improbable tale , but portrayed in a plausible fashion . hanks is outstanding i think gary sinise's performance overlooked for me the most powerful moment of movie when lt dan goes his swim ocean making peace with god
original , gripping moving fun!tom hanks was incredible .
it is not just a movie , philosophy forgotten easily in this crazy world of ours . drama about simple man who ready to sail with the wind full gusto like feather opening/closing musical suite his life way he 'simply' goes through turbulent times around as well 'run' and feather,..they are all symbolic nobody expects real be that but beautifully crafted (critics u listening) forces ponder upon another looking at things ! great acting wit direction music (perhaps best cross sectional selection greatest american classics)
run forrest run! ! mama always said that life was like a box of chocolates , you never know what your gonna get . this movie is absolutly hilarious tom hanks did such good job but i found lot adult content in it and turned me off bit suppose thats the going rate for
just an amazing story,awsome cinematogrophy , and the best performance tom hankes has done . story of a stupid person that never does anything actually he kinds floats by so many historical moments such big roll in history is not even aware of.he grows up alabama raised his mother barly makes into public school but insup being on national football league because ability run fast from then meets three presidents serves vietnam awarded medal honor speakes infront thousands during war protest gos to china plays world ping-pong championship uncovers watergate scandle starts biggest scrimpin company america one original investors micresoft runs for years straight across country obviously exciting life after advevture always returns home epoc film historicly you will see same once have seen it through eyes forrest gump
my favorite movie , and the first i have been able to say that about . one of those movies can be watched over again not frame in this is boring also it gave americans a lesson history was so badly needed best soundtrack all time
definitely not for the faint of heart like all tarantino films.this action movie blasted onto time great lists.the superb script ,excellant casting and groundbreaking editing style make this an alltime in my opinion overshadows pulp fiction as tarantino's best .
awsome movie ! i could watch it a 10000 times and still love
forrest gump has always been one of my favorite movies , and i'm sure that 25 years from now people will still be watching it laughing crying along with . i thought tom hanks was at his best here acting in this film or any other for matter is so believable intense never have many subplots fit into the big picture perfectly really enjoyed seeing history through eyes a man who just sees things as they are doesn't provide an opinionated slant way another analysis on jfk simple actually sort funny he said : somebody shot while riding car meeting both lbj hilarious... got butt..  love jenny makes compelling drama friendshp bubba (obsessed shrimp) some moments sad ones well goes to run across country shrimp business play football do anything imaginable despite having low iq loved how down earth nothing mattered him but making those around happy honoring their memory when died (momma jenny) great performance by sally field forrest's momma before seen movie brought out all audience's emotions classic !
a break from the usual cliches . great  !
i could watch this over and , do !!!! ! yes a little long some of the scenes are probably not neccassary,like scene towards end him running to san francisco back ? what was that all about
brilliantly directed and very funny !
tom hanks is amazing , and this movie does a great job of covering several decades history without ever getting boring . callmetootie disgrace
reservoir dogs is my favorite movie and tarantino's best film . great crime
almost everything you could ask for .
i really like this movie . tom hanks does an excellent job as forrest gump in the it isn't all drama , many funny things
a superb film , hanks is unforgettable . direction from zemeckis brilliant sinise robin wright and sally field are all excellent emotions run riot in this laughing crying en masse
i think have heard this moving quoted more times then any other movie since it's making . and still laugh at it ! the is one of those icons that will never die tom hanks performance was incredible , as robin wright don't he ever matching talent for a again or not so far hasn't wonderful movie! run forest run!!!
i remember saw this movie when was younger , and though didn't understand it very well loved anyway . forrest gump is one of the most brilliant movies made so far tom hanks worked his best at being god just love that guy ! back to it's a original sentimental don't know how anyone wouldn't like that's all have say about that..
its a great movie . tom hanks is so believable that you are beginning to think the script or maybe original novel was written with him in mind director robert zemeckis pulled out all stops for crafting superb film robin wright excellent , and computer enhanced gary sinise this by way has more special effects than final part of star wars trilogy return jedi thanks people lucasart whose magic woven seamlessly into not just space opera fantasy flick one those movies where s/fx mutating reality but anyways i forrest gump
this is one of my favourite movies . as always , tom hanks does a great job do all the other actors story forrest gump really interesting and it's quite funny in parts also definitely worth seeing
my fav . tied with private ryan every thing you want is in this movie
it was great to be able go into a show and sit back split your sides laughing .
one of the greatest , most influential movie i've ever seen in my life . inspirational to anyone and everyone i really enjoyed it 'cause shows what a person's potential is if they try never give up
very interesting movie . quite long but entertaining
great movie !
it was very creative and touching . made me think , can a man(although fictitious)actually experience all these things in life ?
this was a sad movie but it has that image everyone will want to watch . is i always remember because the character very interesting
it is a really , funny movie . i've watched this twice means lot that he worked so hard to keep his friend's promise
i loved how cute tom hanks was in this movie . it a had funny people , which made me laugh very hard great original
this movie was the most successful playing in theaters . i would recommend to all saw three times and purchased video for my collection forrest overcame his handicap , he did not let himself be isolated from people mother played an extremely good mentor life
very funny ! tom hanks as a retarded man . never seen him guy but that's why this picture was great
this is a good family movie .
this movie was intense . but never abused cheap tactics , explosions or cheezy romantic dialogue it's in fact is probably second only to pulp fiction quality and humor we see the perfect crime go horibly tragically awry without ever seeing it happen even though main players are all cold-blooded killers their plight find sympathy actually care about what happens them these markings of a good film
engaging , funny sad dealing well in both fantasy and reality 'forest gump' is movie entertainment at its very best . i would even go as far to say that it's the film produced since golden age of hollywood tom hanks one actors our time who has given us most memorable characters on i'm glad wasn't only able see his talent way back 'bosom buddies' days hope he goes make more great movies with heart like 'forest'
one of the most clever movies ever made . what a story line so original with two best actors in lead roles
i love this movie . not only is it well produced but tom hanks shines as always the story continues to excite viewer there are so many metaphors in that you should watch a dozen times get them all
if i want to see comedy and drama in one movie , this would be it . the mixture of stories historical data just plain old humor was great is fun
forrest gump is a beautifully directed film that deals with important contemporary issues . it presents of single motherhood , aids mental retardation and advocacy great story how one man very low iq became financially successful rough beginnings adventures represents the best what decent life can be
this is my favorite movie by far . it's so funny and touching at the same time tom hanks gives a performance of life
i thought this was a great movie . tom hanks did good job in the very entertaining it funny as well dramatic
this was a great movie that took place over span of about 30+ years . i loved the historical and emotional aspect how characters were developed everything just hits your heart
quentin tarantino came bursting onto the scene with this classy and thrilling thriller . completely mixed up , there is no time here times change great watch out for a cops ear mr blonde knife film was after opening sequence in bar it took me to sickening sight of orange (tim roth) white (harvey kietel) car shot gut trying comfort him while driving entertaining as they get cool slick awesome three words that describe tarantino's debut not quite good pulp fiction but still damn see now summary : an excellent must-see
the character portrays true life experiences as a disabled person dealing with these incidents and social events . i like this movie , it gives examples of how people can display respect to disabilites
tom hanks' personality in this movie was heartwarming . it's a that you should watch when wanna' see non-corrupted the whole story plot great because it took
forrest gump has it all . is a dramatic , comedic action filled movie tom hanks exceptional as the story flashback into sixties and seventies with super soundtrack that defines era
family movie . this is a good sentamental forrest gump will make anyone laugh
this is my all time favorite drama movie . it was the only i've ever cried during , at least since i a teenager music beautiful and memorable hanks does an incredible job haley joel osment male child actor even shoes up briefly
this could be described as the all american film . it includes so much of our country's history , from vietnam to jfk seen through eyes a man named forrest gump is also great feel and good story because has lower iq than most people
this has to be one of the best movies i have seen . forrest , who everything stacked against him overcomes it do more than anyone could dream what a movie
terintino is a bad ass ! this movie very smart , though little disturbing still great work although most of the actors are unheard they increadable . not as explosive pulp fiction it up there besides some irrelevent flaws it's mind twister wonderful
tom hank's best performance . i don't know if he was retarded or not hope they have a sequel
this was an amazing movie . the impossible now seems possible because shows a retarded man able to make it that we are all and nothing's ever too late or bad it's definitely gives hope
this movie was a great drama flick . it really interesting how he met so many presidents and showed up at memorable events in history
this movie made up for a lot that most of the public missed in history class . story(not true) gave us glimpse so much went on country period time
i think this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while . there were no real special effects or anything that nature , but acting and story good enough to keep all viewers interested great movie would recommend anyone
forrest gump was a touching movie . everyone i went to go see it with agrees that the worthy of oscar indeed is
i would say this movie sparked , or perhaps solidified a new genre of films the ultra violence suburbia . similar to movies before it clockwork orange twin peaks and blue velvet r-dogs looks at weird world needed compete rise top is by far tarantino's best others ones falling victim more his ego poor acting ability pulp fiction was entertaining decent but not ground breaking like lays foundation for many better 1990s although quite frankly am sick them now
intriguing way to portray the 50's-80's via a nice but naive forrest gump . i liked this movie though am more into other genres such as comedy
this movie is magical for many of us who like it  . robert zemickis unintentionally creates a that so poignant and thought provoking changes the life those love , not to mention giving foreigners me different perspective recent american history personally i always feel positive serene when listen or recall beautiful score lines scenes forrest gump an classic !
forrest gump is the greatest motion picture in history of american cinema . every other movie should be compared to and then determined if it meets criteria what a good has possible type genre at same time one most simplistic story lines ever acting wonderful , great cinematography extraordinary director robert zemeckis brilliant directors he also overlooked hollywood today able give us movies better than that spielberg yet does not get much recognition think was man who brought back future i ii iii death becomes her framed roger rabbit contact soon released lies beneath cast away truly master filmmaker when found out number 71 on afi's list 100 very disappointed how could best all ? finally realized why turns made by idiots don't there's anyway tootsie now i'm usually go about write my opinion something so strongly but really me mad reading review imdb ben morgan seemed hate his had nothing things say starts off saying surely must rate as biggest dupes quite marketeers managed pass this film beyond powers reason goes like : would put into sort class wonder years -what's bad it's show with gary sinise gump's vietnam sergeant sally field well mother effects are nicely added soundtrack predictably chosen given period covers little more piece chronicalling life across three decades affected namely mr -no sh*t sherlock said come shawshank redemption pulp fiction will looked upon favourably over-awarded doubt highly buddy that's special some people fake cheesy others do these consider tootsie? perhaps such because certain mood magical feeling stays you for long knowing live through seeing just foolish loving world am proud an changed way see can feel sorry didn't they're ones missing evan campbell winnipeg canada
one of the ten greatest movies all time
a big sprawling historically relevant movie . from talking to people , it seems like this either touched you or didn't i really liked the way interspersed forrest's tragic life with key events in american history
this movie was great , itmade fun of the army and vietnam while showing how easy it actually is to succeed in country
forrest gump is an incredible mixture of genres . definitely a great movie to see
tom hanks is fantastic .
quentin tarintino really outdid himself with this seemingly low budget film . the storyline was great and i loved jumping around between past present heavey keitel perfect choice for his part one of best films made in last 10 years
this is my favorite movie of all time . tom hanks' performance was amazing , and the story a classic forrest gump has become one heros friends it truly great
a gentle comedy with dry sense of humour
the best film ever!! ! what more can i say ? i've seen it four times cried each time first at least an hour :o)
forrest gump is one of my all-time favorites
another favorite of mine and has been since i was a kid . this is classic film.. great story full humor sadness
i love stand by me . four boys age 12 go off to find the body of a year old who was feared dead.it takes place it late 1950s this is mainly about friendship between boys.all have their own issues deal with in personnal lives they are at end childhood and on brink adolesance movie combination humor , sadness.all kid actors great well done
resevoir dogs is tarantino's preliminary film to the chronologically disjointed and colorfully violent , pulp fiction  . it had same elements of pulp. without being as polished or grand it's a smaller story with rawer edge but that doesn't detract from fact an exhilarating full sharp dialogue intriguing situations particular thing struck me about was special camraderie among characters gave us glimpse into personifications oxymoron-'honorable criminals' keitel's 'mr white' foremost example this : second scene in where mr orange bleeding profusely gut white holding his hand encouraging him hang on one most interesting heartwrenching scenes cinematic male-bonding too melodramatic kitsch-y
was my favorite movie as a kid , i still watch it on occasion
great movie from a author . it was included in the book different seasons by stephen king also four novellette collection shawshank redemption and apt pupil , which were made into movies will wheaton his pre-stat trek days brilliant for first only time thankfully brief career
four young boys out on an adventure before they're to old be ruined by adulthood . the relationship between these , their interactions and behaviors are all believable parts acted very well-river phoenix was great so were other 3 who i can't remember names right now i've probably seen this movie 5 times it's my top 20
a movie close to my heart , friends and i were these kids we did the exact same things growing up in rural midwest hanging along railroad tracks getting minor trouble . an american classic river phoenix was best teen actor of his generation
oh my god i grew up with this movie
just as good the book body . river phoenix shined in this classic rob reiner did an excellent job of directing epic on adventure , set out to find a missing preteen boy
there should be more movies like this one-a simple , compelling story that you will remember always . what drew me into is it reminds of childhood adventures although i am a female and all boys very much identified with friendships would see if they left the wonderful feeling movie does most leave alienation lost values my time favorite !
this is one of my favorite tarintino films all time . theres never a dull moment as film rolls on with its amazing ensamble cast and terrific script movie tells the story crime , but shows making it more brilliant told through series flashbacks characters creating perfect telling how went wrong where everyone ended up most interesting ways to tell i've ever seen.outstanding performances by actors in brilliantly directed hats off you quentin
this is one of the most amazing movies our (some our) childhoods ! it show a beautiful portrayal four innocent boys . acting outstanding for these children they were all around age twelve had lines memorized feel good movie that sure will get to you in way watching i just wish days could have such substance oh well
another stephen king book made into a successful movie . is there any question he's one of the best authors his time ?
this is an excellent movie about friendship . it's what you'd expect from stephen king the soundtrack simply perfect probably greatest any could ever have
i came across this movie for the first time a few years ago and it held my attention right to end . way boys stick together things they go through on their adventure is amazing very well-made look all when i'm flipping channels
wonderful ! i thought that this was just one of those depressing 80's movies (and in a way it ; wish had friends like that) , but watched the whole thing on amc and loved . great performance by river phoenix
this film is so poinient . the characters are built up beautifully and you really feel hurt friendship that portrayed in must be one of best things stephan king has written , its sensitive makes laugh cry phoenix river was outstanding hard to believe he 16 i think he's still missed as a very talented actor his younger brother joquin following
i liked this movie a lot because it portrayed four friends who stuck together even under the worst of circumstances . was very touching and made me cry
great flick . a mellow movie by stephen king standards , but philosophical
thw best of the quentin tarintino trilogy and his first . this film is executed marvolously everything believable , every line a character has seems real almost immproved also very original to take crime movie away from that been commited tell stories through series flashbacks for primary scenes aftermath no director with right mind could ask better ensemble cast bring picture life heavy hitters like harvey keitel,tim roth,steve buscemi(in one most memrobale roles) michael madson really make unbelievably good drama filled as much humor action course so it bit morbid crude at times there inparticular nails me time when mr.pink keeps asking joe why he be then joe's reply puts on ground must see any fan or great story telling seen eyes visionary maker
it's the most classic movie . i love that it made me cry when movies are so fake these days gave and understanding of young boys
stand by me is a great movie because each character developed so well . we really get to know the boys and empathize with their experiences even though my childhood was very different from any of those characters , i felt that able understand what they were going through
my favorite movie . the acting is so truthful and characters grow much during span of film i always cry , though i've seen it 20+ times believe are really in situation have truly grown closer to each other but at same time further apart
a psychological thriller which looks into the minds of gang youths coming age . movie demonstrates wonderfully difficult and disturbing times face in attempting to define themselves through history , family literature
this movie is a classic . i thought that the lead actor was so cute it has great soundtrack too !
such a great movie , excellent acting and universal story . i really enjoyed the narrating looking back aspect of film an somehow soul searching adventure these best friends course since it was based on stephen king novella there had to be that morbid flare (their entire journey occurs because they are in search dead kid's body) however even played key part kid who gordy did superb job acting..the look his face as he took leach size small mammal from inside underwear priceless
this movie was great . the plot best i have ever seen other directors should follow one
great directing by tarintino . good acting and cinematography as well it was very put together an excellent movie for anyone who liked pulp fiction
this is a great movie . to me , it's classic about group of young boys trying make it in their town one i will always love watch
its tough watching this after being subjected to too many seasons of the wonder years copying reminscing narrator shtick that movie pioneered so brilliantly . but good heart still shines through excellent acting and a wonderful script
beatifully portrays friendship and the strains of adolescence . i bought video watch it at least once a year best affirming line : do you think i'm weird ? yeah but everybody's
stand by me is a great movie . it has wonderful cast and captures the true meaning of friendship which something all us can relate to
heavy on the violence but in a good way . witty humor throughout movie i'd watch it for soundtrack alone go mr pink !
masterful , concise dubious chilling real . loved it
never in all my life has one movie had such an effect on me and mentality . american beauty is not action film it will dazzle you with visual effects , hunky leading men or a thrilling plot but what its poetic thought provoking dialogue perfectly depicted story of suburban subtle brilliant music score composed by thomas newman most very impressive acting this achieves many directors often fail to do manages be perfect combination humour drama romance reminder how we can take the beautiful things earth for granted sometimes words lester burnham (spacey) have no idea i'm talking about sure don't worry someday
masterpiece . i can't think of another character can identify more with , from '90s cinema than lester burnham remember how got to be this....sedated
quentin tarntino is a genius . in his first major hollywood film , he gathers an awesome cast to go along with vague writing and creative directing
it was a movie about middle-aged man having mid-life crisis . he later gets tired of people controlling him or shoving into the background and decides to take his life back at some point in our lives we try regain control ourselves do something that makes us happy
theme is about how everyone has their own sense of what finding beauty in life entails . the film illustrates that traditional model american -- a nice home with your family suburbs can be shallow facade and not as fulfilling it appears suggests deviating from glorified suburban ideals (by taking fast food job , dating someone younger befriending misfit being mistaken gay etc.) will bring you fierce recrimination yet may only way for some to discover true happiness movie wasn't designed an uplifting crowd pleaser much one provokes its message while i was uncomfortable watching at times intriguing affecting enough me want view many key scenes second time immediately afterward states where might just see empty bag floating wind another
i have mixed feelings as to how this movie should rank against the greatest movies of all time . mean , love it but that's because can relate lester in many ways it's hard for me see a woman would wanting be with 17 year old cheerleaders still high on list site
this is the greatest movie ever made !
entirely entertaining . callmetootie is my nemesis
there are only a few movies that have affected me like this one . i had to sit for an hour afterwards just ponder what seen amazing movie! !
a must see for tarantino fans and people who enjoy hilarious but off the wall sitcoms . bank robbery gone bust-a rat-enjoy bloodbath witty comedy remarks
this movie is so amazing it should be deemed illegal . shows that the family living suburbia with mercedes benz and nice house lovely rose garden still isn't perfect inside takes all to another level makes abnormal aadams look like waltons catch phrase means more than what you are watching in (the closer for those of who don't know) when go home , out somebody something there probably them meets eye a remarkable achievement i am happy many people saw beauty did enjoy try really late at night becomes much over whelming recomend every one if it's entertaining own twisted way
man was this a good movie . sam mendes - first time director he is the big thing for future directed marvelously , and came up with well-crafted brilliant sad it's music perfect acting script absolutely mendes' directing great it thoroughly deserved its oscars will prove to be classic in 10 years most likely making onto top 100 film lists all around world i would say on afis bought vhs you should too see found nearly no flaws almost watched an audience they laughed were shocked such summary : become
a beauty of film . acting first class and spacey is terrific from start to finish his mentor jack lemmon would be proud directing superb debutant mendes music brilliant
american beauty was truly a great film , and one of the first times i've actually agreed with academy on oscar awards . i hadn't heard lot hype surrounding it because saw before friend mine just said is go see !  can say that it's definitely my favorites you through such wide range emotions from watching this there are many comedic parts to laugh at some classic lines (like part where lester writes about what he does work) also feel rage or anger (how ricky treated by his dad how shallow angela seems be much bitch carol be) may bit an over dramatization life in suburbs but not far stretch really think shows bad people have serious problems try cover up flowers white picket fences other stuff makes me andrea yates woman who drowned her 5 children ending too certainly gruesome complete surprise due information gives beginning mood story hope demise kevin spacey brilliant actor...definitely favorite annette benning superb job...she's so playing obnoxious role actors did their roles as well can't anyone would played them better movie drama...it's drama comedy suspense never boring for days afterward still thinking discussions friends thought provoking
to answer your question , ruby i think this movie is about getting what you want and not letting stupid obstacles get in way . life short never know...a repressed gay man might shoot the head or something
this is a very good movie . the plot like no other not too many directors could make work , but done perfectly there never moment where you can tell what will come next great
one of the most hilarious movies i've ever seen ! poigant and powerful in a way that affects us all . true beauty
this film is so powerful that i sat down and realized just how much connect with it . a straight up human movie story for real people watching changed my entire outlokk on life we only have long to live should love the fullest ricky's bag monolouge nearly brought me tears i'll forever deserves be more than #7 list highly recommend anyone it's deep beauty will touch you way touched true ; sometimes there in world..
what can i say , loved this movie . words cannot describe how good was acually changed the way thought viewed life amazing performances by entire cast best ensamble scince magnolia there are so many beautiful things about like ricky fitz's bag monolouge it almost brings me to tears every time hear or kevin spacy's at end of here is a that everyone relate in one another humans and finding which once lost its living again not late people too depressing but all ending is...beautiful if film ever produced deserves picture must see sometimes theres much beauty world.....
the first time i saw this movie , left theatre shocked . told whole truth not only about american families but all around world ! annete bening was stunning thora birch and mena suvari both were incredible wes bentley unbelievable it kevin spacey's role made me love him completely what an acting of lester difficult spacey to perfection
out of all the films i have seen in my life none ever touched me so deeply and intimatly as american beauty . this film is favorite i'm not just saying that , it actually changed how saw things related most to ricky fitz young man living next door burnums honesty gorgeouse story are only shined by powerful performances given best ensemble cast since magnolia everytime gives speech on world cry touching personal,i cannot see people be moved its simple never before message.i am glad last picture year decade was perfect sumation our new found spirituality will always hold high one if produced.it heart sometimes...there's much beauty...in world..
justly deserved to win the acadamy awards . an incredible mix of plot , drama humor and great acting
if any film could be a fine wine , american beauty is it . compelling with strong leads leaving the viewer genuine empathy for each character it's beautifully filmed and very touching i am in love this you miss may one of last masterpiece's modern cinema
this movie takes everything that is considered taboo or nasty and shows people stuff like really can happen . by the end of , you are definitely left w/this weird feeling wish things hadn't been so bad for neighbor spacey's character gotten shot...what a good
well , if you have read any of my other movie reviews will know that it is not odd i just saw this . did hear great american beauty and won best picture however really had no clue what was about intrigued captivated throughout the entire shocking surreal yet eerily possible characters were definitely extreme am afraid in day age they weren't too far off mark kevin spacey annete bening gave extraordinary performances there are some very disturbing issues being tackled or explored but surely a worth seeing comedic as entertaining thought provoking ironic
i love quentin tarantino . nobody knows how to write a plot like him the story is told from different points of view and puzzle which slowly fits create thrilling climax there are great twists at end wonderful movie
i was dumbfounded when annette benning did not win an oscar .
i loved it and could watch again . acting fab all around !
desrved every thing it won .can only be compared to who's afraid of virginia woolf .see them both now !
i truly thought the movie was great , my wife had seen it a year ago and raved about just saw recently very impressed...i enjoyed all characters acting superb definitely kevin spacey's best performance to date (has put in several good performances) . sad look at our society but quite provoking...great ending !
a movie that makes you think about life and all the bad things come along with it . delves into dark , taboo of american society yet see beauty in everyday we take for granted weird keeps getting weirder but end everything comes together sense great writing acting really funny !
excellent movie with a unique plot and great actors . kevin spacey is seen to be slightly mental in the beginnning not likable , as well yet continues he character whom you feel for
deserves all the praise it got  !
american beauty is a brilliantly crafted film that echoes john cheever's the swimmer --both are cautionary tales suggesting how easily lost we may become in search of dream and difficult it to find our way home again . powerful ending presents narrative from grave as spacey's character , with christlike forgiveness dies for us suggests existence path might take through thicket materialism egotism sexuality characterizes landscape sights higher during long second before death ; hopefully will see this less traveled earlier own individual journey
awsome - this movie was painful to watch for all the characters became real as i recognized then one degree or another in my own world!.. . loved it! ! benning is great so hot too
excellent movie - it offered some interesting insight into suburban culture often we only see what they want us to this showed could happen if people looked deeper .
great movie . harvey keitel plays a good role as does tim roth tarantino movies are if you like what he
this one's for you , all eddie bauer-wearing suv-driving suburban-sprawl-inducing yuppies who think are so superior . annette bening is stellar as the woman we love to hate ( notice how handle on her pruning tool matches gardening clogs ? that's not an accident )
well directed with a strange atmosphere . the actors were great and dialogue was excellent
this movie was extremely entertaining . the narration over at beginning and end were a definaite plus acting spectacular also , idea to show rose pedals instead of nudity ingenious added classiness
great film with a cast . an extremely stark and realistic view on crime harvey keitel , michael madsen tim roth are awesome ! very original story format tarantino is genius
look closer and you may find out that there are things about might not like . this movie portrays the essence of life in middle class suburbia under superfical happiness is a disturbing very thought provoking intriging fact so many people related to shows we all abonormal
cinemetography , screenplay and kevin spacey makes this film a must see . it takes you behind closed doors into an upper middle class neighborhood kinky !
what can i say.. . wow! !
an incredible movie . it combines drama with subtle comedy element american beauty also sends message that stirs emotion and stimulates the mind
reservoir dogs is quentin tarantino's best film and arguably one of the films , period . it was very cutting edge in it's time remains so several years technique evolution later will undoubtedly continue to be far into future this twists your imagination destroys morals you'll love like nothing else go see movie !
this movie was well thought out . i agree with the oscar award made very beautifully is one of best movies have ever seen
this was one of the most thought-provoking movies i have ever seen . anette benning character really made me take a look at myself , and what can you say about kevin spacey-the man is best actor our generation
this is an awesome movie . it was thought provoking and not too predictable you need to see understand
i loved every part of the movie , especially ending becuase it was so unsuspected . covered a lot topics that go on in everyday lives like drugs sexuality friends relationships jobs etc really made me think about my life and how 'special' everything around is
and what a beauty this is . i haven't seen film uncompromising in its search for truth since 1969's best picture , midnight cowboy sure it's not perfect but audacity exhilirating an important wake up america !
if i were speaking to the people who said that this movie was bad , would do it veeeery slooooowwly so as they be able understaaaaand me . thing about is you need look deeper there are layers complicated--you can't at like current julia roberts and just go home requires contemplation certainly not indicative of a dark place inside yourself please liked appreciate individuality situations arise in all walks life feel didn't reuse movie's tagline closer
aboslutely loved the film . a wonderful depiction of average oridinary life at it's best
my friends told me it was a must-see , and they were right !
top to bottom a breathtaking piece of work . absolutely loved it , especially annette bening because that role could have been so much less in the hands lesser actress (which is almost every one hollywood)
wow ! i had enormous expectations still it was better than thought would be this is the most dramatic movie i've ever seen , one of ironic theatre on film hopefully will create a new aera where people start making films sam mendes may become greatest all directors in history - at least his first absolutely terrific more anything else it's script that overwhelmed me expected deep while fact as entertaining todo sobre mi madre . totally disagree characters cartoon-like again compare to much cartoony great acting course and fasten your seatbelts : ending like taken out an agatha christie novel even sixth sense' teqniques matrix fight club added together little american pie which think second best year hope it'll get tons oscars only thing didn't with actually trailer hehehe tell but maybe positive made my cinematic experience overwhelming 5 date after forrest gump gandhi la vita bella dogme 1 festen :-d
a little simplistic in it's portrayal of rebellion and middle-class ennui , but these times resurgent conformity material crassness very refreshing to see movie promote among other things simple joy pleasure . the acting is fantastic spacey deserves acclaim he received ; wes bentley also mesmerizing
this movie is absolutely flawless . i don't understand how it only #26 on the list if you haven't seen , go rent right now
this is the loveliest film i've seen in a long time . poetic testament to what real every human heart kevin spacey wonderful as always , and chris cooper who doesn't get enough work films also excellent keep an eye on wes bentley kid going be major
fantastic acting , character sketches story idea and plot development . spacey is beyond excellence in his portrayal of a lust-struck man midlife all the other characters are almost as vibrant their depiction well casted way it's told after death intriguing it works this case masterpiece that will be known 200 years from now great literature we know lady chatterly's lover today
excellent movie . pretty 'deep' though , so don't expect you'll understand it easily very funny
this is the best movie i've seen all year . when i walk out of a theatre completely speechless and in daze , quite something ! if kevin spacey and/or anette bening don't win oscars i'd be very surprised disappointed
fantastic movie ! kevin spacey is creepy in this one .
one of the better movies i've seen in a while . don't ever let me be like kevin spacey's character was before his rebirth
this movie has an excellent plot . it the typical quentin tarantino structure where gets started at last scene of then jumps around to finish end comes together perfectly is one my favorite movies
this movie is so f*ing sweet it clearly shows how america troubled with these poor , annoying  tyrants that hurt the nations economy . and derek vinyard does what all white americans ahould go out there kick crap of dumb ni**ers
shocked me the first time i saw it....and have watched it at least 10 times since
put your mouth on the curb ! hearing that still makes me cringe . god bless you derek vineyard
a very powerful movie . not for the young it doesn't pull any punches when comes to way skinheads and neo-nazi's in country spread their hate this film is about skinhead who goes prison killing black guy while his younger brother gets involved with he out of older (ed norton) trys get him away from that he's been rehabilitated i've watched 3 times ending still me must see anyone over 14 i'd advise people an adult , preferably parent if they can it's pretty strong ed norton has be one best actors our time
i loved this movie it was a great could watch over and not get board .
what appealed to me about this movie is that the focus of racism from other side fence , which very rare in film . we see a young white racist thug and hate he emulates his father's view on life eventually anger over death spirals as contributing factor downfall passes onto brother i also liked ed norton's character can danny mirror image himself before went into prison knows order for get through needs change it will not conquer all
how can you not like this masterpiece ? i have seen it dozens of times . never get bored if haven't epic , advise do brilliant!! !
american history x is a movie that i think all people need to watch regardless of the violence . this stuff occurs everyday in our country , and nothing being done about it will wake you up make feel like improving race relations  ! loved
a very intense , chilling movie that exploits the racial issues still exist far and throughout this great country of ours . as usual edward norton charismatic actor he is gives us brilliant performance brutal skinhead who when released from prison has finally seen error his ways talk about character transformation i thought working buddy in did wonderful job together also by usually-annoying furlong it truly shockingly blunt film with its language exploitation reality racism offends me but found to be good suggest all americans whether you've been able let go or not see
this film is brutal in it's portrayal of racism , prejudices and the consequences thereof . certainly not a for average viewer ; many scenes run you over like freight train if offends should see blunt treatment racist ideas your cup tea i still think since it takes on these frank manner reviewer known as newsoul would be well served to watch
an absolutely powerful movie about racism and overcoming one's own prejudices . edward norton is fantastic in this it's disturbing graphic , yes but necessarily so definately worth watching at least once
if you have race issues should watch this , and still do after that your ignorant ! im glad not . put in pipe smoke it
my favourite movie ever . i have it on tape and saw about 10 times , one night even 3 in a row very hard but has important message edward norton makes the better think it's of movies that everyone just to see
my 2nd favorite movie of all time . a must see ? -scarface
wow . edward norton is one of the best actors all time ! he gets better with every movie does god i love that guy anyway , fantastic loved how performers made charcters seem real this shows you hard life can be it everything until sure understand what they're trying to convey
may offend people . does not gloss over racism which is what makes it such an excellent movie , but also quite disturbing edward norton gives amazing performance
it is hard to think of one person who can't gain something from such an important movie . this will shock you awake gets the begining and not let go until learn every harsh but well needed lesson i just wish was a manditory film for high school kids especially loved beautiful scenes toward end that show edward nortan's character furlong's as little on beach how much wonder they each had life makes point hatred learned we are born with hope those see don't take wrong way glorifying which most us obviouse enough stateing ignorance want people watch have humanity day might unite.if in mood move teach very stern highly recommended
the best thing about this movie is edward furlong and norton
this is a great movie . there isn't person in the world who can't learn something from film
features edward norton's best performance to date . incredible movie with mucho importance one of the fifty movies i've ever seen
great movie with some wonderful talented actors . danny glover , whoopi goldberg and oprah winfrey was a natural the best part when whoopis character finally stood up to that mean husband of hers you could only cheer her on as she got stronger
underrated 80's movie- terrific acting . a powerful drama the fact that it won zero oscars is still one of all-time embarrassments academy
i love this movie since almost every whoopi goldberg plays a role in is great :-) however it very sad but like such movies
i cried ! - this says a lot for me
excellent movie . everyone did a great job , oprah danny glover and whoopi goldberg sad but i enjoyed it makes me happy that we are not living in the early 1900's..
one of my most favorite all time movies because it's ability to explore the minds characters . this movie gives you a sense passion for criminals that become vitimized and officer who gains everyone's trust , then turns around shoves it up their ass
great movie !! ! even i shed a tear or two in this , especially the scene early on when sisters are separated as young girls not to see each other again for many years .
this is probably the most moving aspiring and touching , riveting movie i have ever seen ! it's life of a poor young black woman (whoopi goldberg) who's sold off into marridge where her own kids husband hate but soon makes living revenge prosperity . reccomend to everyone
an outstanding movie , just as good the book with great performances and beautiful cinematography . steven speilberg should have won oscar for this because it is one of his best thumbs up on casting !
steven spielberg should have at least been nominated for an oscar this movie . is disturbing , but important in understanding our history a realistic way
one of the most unforgettable and beautiful films last generation . vivid portrayals all around , writing that brings pain poignancy joy straight to your heart
a movie that i could watch over and . loved oprah in this whoopi was excellent as danny glover real life picture from the african american view early 1900's
a really beautiful movie . whoopi goldberg was spectacular that first time she smiled , when shugg avery there it made me cry so raw real i think is possible the best acting i've ever seen did wonderful job in very few words
made me cry - that speaks volumes
whoopi's first and best performance . a touching movie , the of it's time
tarantino's direction makes this movie chronologically confusing . it does however , not lack for action and good acting dropping you right into the story like pulp fiction has many memorable scenes
best movie of all time ! everyone who is a human should watch this mvoie it's history , love hate and victory in one .
this is my favorite movie ! the story warm and inspiring . i loved different stages in characters lives also way it ended music was good
i gave this movie a five because it has historic meaning . gives good picture of black women's past experience
oprah was great in this movie . it is a long but worth the wait good cultural about african americans
the best movie i have ever seen .
this movie was so sad . i must have seen it at least ten times and still cry the music is good don't know if would been able to survive in that time period as a woman whoopi did fabulous job makes me hate men brings out lot of emotions very powerful
oprah was great in her acting and the movie has a lot of symbols that can affect our lives .
it was a really good movie . whoopi goldberg , oprah winfrey and danny glover acted excellent in this abused treated her badly took sister away- but at the end reunited them back together
oprah and whoopie goldberg were excellent in this soulful , spiritual film about women's relationships love sexuality hardships .
timeless movie . and how perfect was stuck in the middle with you for ear scene ?
i read the book last week and rented movie afterwards . it was a wonderful adaptation of
it may be a movie with mostly african-american cast , but the women in this story exist all races and face same choices . whoopi goldberg shows pain strength as she grows so does viewer oprah winfrey seems strong defeat very well importance of sisterhood is message need to learn remember men see too you'll enjoy film book by alice walker even better
one of the greatest movies ever made .
several of my guy college friends would keep reservoir dogs poster up on their walls . at that point i had not watched the movie thought it was a typical found very exiting , images are vivid especially as one (i think police guy) got his ear cut off makes you get into story it's just plain killing takes roller coaster emotions so this is intense to watch it!! !
great . robin williams was as always
normally a fan of action movies , i was skeptical about watching dead poets society . after did however found it to be an amazing movie with great plot and many lessons learned hits close home alot people on points opression peer pressure just plain being yourself robin williams stellar job portraying the very enthusiastic individual mr keating who's teachings lead group restless discontented teens reinstate where they read literature from past few centuries taught in this film are based upon transcendentalist views famous writers such as henry david thoreau ralph waldo emerson urges viewers free constraints worrying what others think is perhaps best-written acted have ever seen if you not yet strongly urge do so
really good
the dead poets society , in my opinion is one of best movies ever made and slightly underrated . beneath pure entertainment value its interesting story incredibly brilliant performance by robin williams this film tells much about soul's desire choice vocation versus just trying to do what's expected us authority figures such as parents heads prestigious schools on another level i think it encourages passion books poetry reading besides all other roles were also well acted students seemed very real
one of my favorite movies all times . i can still remember that almost dizzy/stunned (in a positive way) feeling felt after going out the movie theater first time saw it robin williams' best role so far and performance he will hardly ever surpass let's not forget peter weir (director) is man behind this masterpiece many young actors went on to become well-known names +the ending , which as someone else has also written in film history (the only perhaps surpasses citizen kane )
silence of the lambs might have scared crap out me , but i find it to be a psychological thriller not horror movie . this is probably jodie foster's best role and shame she refused do sequel takes you into world psychopath like no other manhunter an excellent prequel
my favorite . excellent message teaches about the power of knowledge and individualism
the life of a seer . that is my through poetry will shall find meaning let us sit in caves and lick past want tradition ? no longer create not be created ! we are poets slaves live our own lives open mindness key to
awesome movie cast . good editing and cinematography very realistic
i don't usually like robin williams , but this was an amazingly powerful film . very well written and acted !
another great robin williams flick . i love this movie because poetry to me is the best stuff on earth combination of actors and story made fall in with
reservoir dogs was made before pulp fiction and finally got the attention it deserved when became popular . is even better than great movie
seize the day
robin williams , as always leads the way .
an inspiring movie that makes you think about taking advantage of every moment life .
if it's got robin williams in it especially when dramatic must be great , obviously i'm a fan .
one of the best movies all time
one of my all-time favorites . superb
this is a great movie with one of the most powerful final scenes ever in . really defined robin williams as dramatic actor captain , my
dead poets society is a great movie with cast .
we watched it in social studies class.. . there was a bit of an issue getting us allowed to watch because language or whatever but ended up seeing i liked lot good movie , plot think realistic they didn't go overboard on the blood and gore trying get more viewers however do that..
this has got to be one of the best war movies all time . it beats out patriot by a long shot film had goods nad presented realistic re-enactment rise and fall 54th massachusetts regiment led col robert gould shaw as lover history , i knew that see movie when first heard about was not disappointed characters were perfectly developed buildup climax phenominal mention wonderful acting all-star cast which included matthew broderick denzel washington morgan freeman cary elwes jay o'sanders others enjoyed seeing each evlve in their own way : espescially whose character so cynical hateful spiteful at beginning but end we learned his true feelings respect for brave men fighting beside him glory is moving inspirational shows who defends country even wronged tries fix wrong exactly what helped do great !
the best and most captivating civil war film to date . denzel washington should have recieved an oscar for his performance one of few films anymore which is inspiring very heroic
wow , is that farris bueler ? oh nevermind . this movies by far my favorite war film very good acting and insane reality i loved it
excellent movie . at times you weren't sure who to feel sorry for , the good guys or bad
although i watched glory when was younger , have to say that it one of the most memorable movies my time . it's drama scenes were touching and theme movie good
i thought that glory was a great movie , and it expresses what the black soldiers had to go through during war .
civil war movies ar historical and tragic . this is one of the best it covers mass black regiment on union side very educational being a film can give people chance to see history , rather than read about great cast including carey elwes morgan freeman denzel washington
excellent film ! it was very touching . a chance for many african-american male actors to shine historically based that semi-accurate no unnecessary battles/bloody scenes at the time of release , showed part history few knew about great musical score haunting melodies
this was one of my favorite movies . i'm not all that into war , but movie really helped me out a lot it showed afro-americans made difference in the world even though took us long time i would love to have been back then only fight and prove point myself others
old war time film that is actually good . realistic and place during nice music
matthew broderick and morgan freeman , as well denzel washington are great . the civil war is shown in all it's unglamorous horror way better than patriot because it deals with history has a moral realistic
this was a very moving movie and brought to life interesting aspects of the civil war .
one of my favorite movies . glory is the story robert gould shaw - white commander first battallions black soldiers in civil war book which movie was based upon written by piecing together letters sent back to his new england family and are still on display a boston museum acting superb morgan freeman , denzel washington matthew broderick compelling (and true) drama intense if you have not seen this brace yourself it sad powerful deep historical
great movie - soundtrack was terrific . a little bit of extraneous graphic violence could make some people squeamish , but you can close your eyes for minute and not miss anything
the first war film i've ever seen . it was exciting this movie at which my eyes actually started watering
easily one of my favorite movies all time , glory paints a wonderful portrait the profound sacrifices americans backgrounds made for fundamental liberties during civil war .
i love this movie .  .almost made me cry .i'm a sap
this has got to be one of the best movies ever made . tom hanks , as always is brilliant in movie a great suspension disbelief you know couldn't true story but wish so much that it was and believe every single thing happens on deffinetly my top five list i've seen
awesome movie ; acting was great !
this was a really great movie and it suprised me as i did not know what to expect . is just good story the acting fantastic production right on , giving that depression era look how can you like tom hanks at his best
arnold is a big time bad ass and this good movie .
another great tom hanks film . this verified how i feel about the death penalty read book too and found movie to be fairly good at covering characters were believable well rounded felt like knew them
it was a powerful book and an equally film . i thought david morse especially good in his role this movie nearly changed the way look at death penalty row country my favorite scene is when john watching of fred astaire ginger rogers , tears are streaming down face michael clarke duncan gave very performance
a great movie . acting and visuals i really enjoyed the story of john ; simple man with extraordinary gifts it kept me interested until end seeing percy get his in was relief for
yet another great movie made from a stephen king novel . ever notice how many tom hanks movies are in the top 20 for this site ?
the green mile is a movie that i probably will never fully forget , because it succeeded in not only grabbing my attention but also emotions . laughed and cried during this watching was worth every minute plot solid acting supurb props to michael clarke duncan for his phenominal performance as john coffey an african american falsely accused of killing two young girls awaiting execution we discover he has ability heal truly god's miracle  great performances usual by tom hanks james cromwell highly reccomended !
the green mile is without a doubt one of best movies i have ever seen . it was nominated for few academy awards , and personally think that deserved picture (don't get me wrong american beauty great but this better) it's got an impressive cast - tom hanks michael clarke duncan james cromwell doug hutchinson way death row (e block) represented beyond mortal imagination most human beings both inmates guards are humanized shows horrors electric chair many ills our penalty system john coffey character almost nonfictional representation anyone who has been wronged by criminal justice applaud director actors take care everyone !
this was a spectactular movie and the cast amazing . even though it is over three hours long , i couldn't stop watching has such magical tone to music almost eerie gave an unbelievable performance doug hutchinson as percy little a**hole by end of you just had urge strangle him tom hanks always gives astounding paul edgecombe bonnie hunt very good too paul's wife david morse great give two thumbs up for pushing around nearly beating crap out sam rockwell so hilarious wild bill barry pepper young gaurd on e block michael jeter inmate who befriends mouse course clarke duncan john coffey accused murder but can life with touch his hands loved evil in these men brought marvelous way if read book
do i even need to say anything ?
really good movie.. . read the book.. just as if not better
this movie is outstanding , not just for it's fine acting and interesting plot but ability to make the viewer think long hard about place death penalty has in so-called civilised society of ours . i would rate as one best have ever seen watched it twice since first saw 3 months ago a must-see any adult who likes depth behind their entertainment
i love this thriller it is entertaining and would be better if jamie took her top off . body can kill man
this was the saddest movie i have ever seen . couldn't stop crying ! even get through end of it , had to turn off titanic nothing compared
wow . what a good movie didn't you just love the way tom hanks managed to make character seem so real ? gee , i can't see him enough more hanks!!!! ! aaahhh ok back loved ending plot theme everything about it i'm looking forward reading book..
enjoyed it so much i bought the dvd . it's a keeper
this was a really great movie , and one of my favourites . it's worth watching original well acted by everyone fairly long but it keeps your attention throughout is little graphic though so not for the weak stomached
this is one of the best movies i've ever seen but it's a total tear-jerker and in end you find that it moves inside lot .
this was an amazing movie ! i don't see how neone could say wasn't great it kept me mesmerized throughout the entire thing .
outstanding plot , with drama emotion and comedy . up there american beauty
i think that this movie is a must-see ! it has like comedy and sad stuff at the same time . to me couldnt watch again but was awesome first dont know how rate , guess u have see yourself because its hard without ruining suprises
this movie made me think about my career in law-enforcement . i was wanting to work a prison but have changed mind if had see or even here someone being exicuted so will probably be normal police officer now
can i just say this movie was incredible . didnt even notice the hours going by because it hooked me at beginning and transported into world of paul edgecomb rest guards prisoners ensemble great actors is what really made spectacular david morse doug hutchison top list they were both played a sniveling little rat to t such moving powerful story so sad all did their parts well , you felt characters feeling have watched again never tire
definately worth the three hours.. . sparking every emotion within a person cast is awesome , acting great and storyline excellent months later we still talk about john coffee
this movie should have won the oscar! ! truly a moving story!
this has to be one of the top movies year . will draw you in and extract every emotion possess characters are well defined early picture story just leads along i couldn't find a weak link cast or is must see
the green mile was a wonderful movie ! one never knows what life comes your way , make best of everything you do in and ?
how this movie did not win the oscar for best film is ridiculous ! i was moved to tears many times .
another fantastic adaptation of stephen king's masterpiece .
the green mile is a wonderful story that will make you believe in miracles and despise dregs of our society . i totally fell love with characters had to get out my kleenex few times this great film has performances by all actors
i thought this movie was great ! it different . a little slow throughout the first hour , but after that fully engaged
i thought this movie was great . liked the whole didn't fall asleep once
this was a superb movie . the chemistry of cast just added to excellence film.i would highly recommend it character study alone is worth price
the best movie i have seen since braveheart !! ! this one should take home all awards possible . a must see of movies ever no regrets that it is 3 hours long , none will be classic as huge steven king fan was pleased to green mile tops his other (with out comparing shinning - wouldn't know how compare those two) ******************************
i enjoyed this movie a lot even though it was long . little disturbing during the execution , but overall good
this is an outstanding movie , with exceptionally well assembled cast . the talented actors bring depth to characters (i may never stand at a urinal same again) visualization of shamanic tradition played out in exceptional ; anyone who has studied shamanism any will immediately recognize sucking shaman john it's three hour that actually keeps you interested and stimulated whole time care what happens want see someone kick crap percy definite must see...heck i'm buying copy !
a great movie with very good acting . it causes one to wonder what is really trying say , but movies like that are always
it was a long movie but incredible . one this years best great cast
it was a tall order , but ted levine(buffalo bill) steals the show from hopkins and foster .
i enjoyed the acting and directing of this movie . also spirituality content was phenomenal
great film . very long , and emotional good actors tom hanks is at his prime
tom hanks has a great hit on his hands . despite it's length , green mile holds the viewer's attention throughout whole movie goers would not want to miss this one
excellent movie . i liked this a lot , would watch it again good story line recommend to everyone after watching was amazed by the that kept talking about for hours and made me cry
i didn't expect to like this one , but wound up being very moved and entertained throughout all three hours . highly recommended..
with an all-star cast , this film definately delivered . i always enjoy watching film- a great mix of action and coemdy tom arnold schwarzenneger had very unique chemistry thought that did wonderful job as the wisecracking annoying sidekick espescially like his line at end : i'm sick sitting in van...  jamie lee curtis also gave performance schwarzenegger's clueless naiive shy wife love way she makes transition from good little housewife to bad girl her notorious dance scene was both hilarious sexy reccomend anyone who is fan or if you're just looking for funny hell flick
well worth the three hours . i'd see it again !
a terrific movie . you won't feel the 3-hours playing time highly recommended !
definately an option for picture of the year . it was similar to shawshank , but great in its own right not much action except when tom hanks and other guards beat up one sadistic guard
great movie ! tom hanks gave an excellent performance (as always) . the captured every essence of book..moving , humorous definitely makes you think if it didn't bring a tear to your eye must be made stone
onem of the best movies ever . i loved it great acting , story lots surprises
what an action movie should be . quite long but you always want to know happens next so it is okay exactly the right amount of comedy  , plenty and tom arnold was brilliant as annoying sidekick arnie
this is easily the best movie of year . tom hanks turns in another fantastic performance , supported by an amazing ensemble cast air magic and faith makes every moment three hour intriguing believable
very powerful emotionally . christopher walken's performance is must-see
most people will think it is too long to take the time sit down and watch , but they do realize was well worth . russian ruloutte scene very intense acted due fact that deniro one of greatest actors all because vietnamese portrayed were told really hit
the best movie i've ever seen , hands down
this is without question one of the most poetic and heart breaking movies ever made . it beautiflly written,directed photographed has best casts assembled for any movie oh yeah there stanley myers breathtaking theme cavatina playing throughout in short you should watch before die!!! !
i love christopher walken and robert deniro . deer hunter is long but its a very good movie
this is the greatest film i have ever scene , although it too sad to be my favourite . epitome of dramatic acting highlighted in russian roulette where so believeable its frightening de niro and walken are truly superb
this was the first movie that really took on emotional experiences of our vietnam veterens in a realistic way . before and after scenes made strong point how war affected those people difference between other it these were not treated as heroes , turn they able to handle life i don't think understood what went there until saw
very twisted and smart . kind of long must be pacient
this is the most memorable movie i have ever seen !
this movie is definitely not for the faint of heart , but what a great . focuses on group friends and impact that vietnam has had their lives christopher walken incredible as guy who just can't get over horrors his capture robert deniro meryl streep give performances well isn't your typical in it doesn't focus so much war itself instead you gain understanding how were absolutely ruined even survivors if you're looking light friday night fare to be moved would good choice
this is one of those movies i will watch over and . such a great story the value human life friendship..the cast was so perfect for characters way kathy bates' character developed from unself confident doormat into person who learned to make her own happieness fun see think we all know an izzy out there somewhere !
its a wonderful movie where kathy bates meets this old lady in nursing home that begins to tell her story and after continues return as she herself grows person
really good movie . you need to pay attention though , don't leave go the bathroom might miss something makes me want have some bbq relationship between two women in this film is wonderful plot spellbinding little and one big surprise pop up through out kathy bates finding herself as a side story only adds watch it all
one of my favorite movies . based on the book by fannie flagg , this heart-warming story tells a tale forbidden love murder compassion caring and redempion in south during early part 20th century told narrative an elderly nursing home resident (played brillianty jessica tandy (but then again have you ever seen her act anything but brilliantly?)) not only gives hope can actually see it caried out screen kathy bates (also brilliant role!) as she listens befriends lady movie is best watched while eating some title's namesak fried greeen tomatoes remember secret sauce!! !
i really enjoyed this movie . thought the teaming of bates and tandy worked great live a few miles from whistle stop cafe it is such quaint place to go like going back in time , looks just did no matter what you order will get fried green tomatoe on your plate food very good their tomatoes are
i think this is a very good movie . it has really superb acting by all the main people , and look to but script takes few liberties that disagree with there some flat out mistakes in would still recommend though because if you haven't seen as many times have (too count) won't notice any of entertaining however reccommend reading book too best version story
great movie! ! i loved kathy bates character.part of the film was done on location just ten miles from here . our small part is a source pride in this area
fried green tomatoes , the quintessential chick flick is a fantastic movie . show alternates between two stories of women's friendship- one taking place in present and other set 50 years earlier small southern town whistle stop kathy bates (as dowdy unenlightened housewife) jessica tandy (playing an octogenarian living nursing home) are great pair they deserve credit for most movie's humor more serious side shown through relationship idgie (mary stuart masterson) ruth (mary-louise parker) who deal with string problems at time when women didn't have many options acting outstanding across board storylines engrossing even if you aren't i recommend checking out this
this movie really amazed me . when first i saw it , went back and again oh the acting was amazing that kathy bates where has she gone ? we miss you come anyway certainly deserves 5 star rating have given
even after 24 years , still the greatest nyc sports psychopath family redemption film ever . will not be topped in our lifetimes
a brilliantly written , beautifully filmed nasty story about largely despicable man . not easy to watch because it is hard find someone like but provoking intelligent film
scorsese's best film . deniro gives the performance by anyone in last 25 years one of drama's all time , and probably drama 80s
robert deniro was never better;jake lamotta really came back in this movie .
maybe the best sports movie ever , and shooting it in b/w added to darkness sinister power of story .
wow ! directed by martin sorsese who has a long working relationship with robert de niro and mainly shot in black white . its basically the life story of jake lamotta's regards to boxing his relationships fight scenes this are magnificent i don't know how people can rate rocky as better than film doesn't sensationalise jake's , it shows him hitting young wife lashing out at brother being jealous other men looking putting on weight storyline is intense fighting i'm not fan but i'll happily sit down watch movie
a true modern classic . the slow motion fight scenes are , indeed realistic and bloody de niro is amazing in this movie about lamotta there adrenalin rushes aplenty thanks to martin scorcese's fine work
truly martin scorsese's masterpiece and a candidate for the greatest film of all-time !
palpable pathos . scorcese does a great job of setting up lamotta ! subsequent fall in the opening night club scene cinematography is gorgeous
i liked the action . how it had lots of mission and what if's when your family gets mixed up with spy work like ending
scorcese's greatest film . it is simply one of the most visually beautiful films i've seen , and has an uncommon power
deniro's best . why is rocky rated higher than this wonderful movie ?
this movie is by far the greatest of 1980s if not all times . it's so realistic , you feel as though are a fly on wall experiencing everything jake does robert de niro gives his very best performance career ! it documents rise to glory and violent cascade down
who's an animal larry ? this is a brilliant film . you appreciate it little more every time watch bobby marty rule !!! !
one of the top sports-related movies ever made . deniro's performance is phenomenal this movie paved way for a host copycats , none which equalled original dark intense and powerful so if you're in mood light-hearted comedy not right to rent
this is dinero at his best . he got so into character that gave himself a concussion and broke both hands in the filming of one scene(when he's prison) i thought it was powerful , quality story an early rocky
adrian !
one of the best sports movies ever made . this movie almost didn't get it was written by at that time and unknown(sylvester stallone) acted largely a cast unknowns as well shot on very low budget also first to use steadycam yet won picture 1976 oscars overcoming all odds..just like rocky did in i can totally relate character , man so down life nobody gives him chance they look it's just about obstacles life..and even if you don't succeed completely atleast went way
this was one great movie . arnold really makes but hunt isn't so attractive , that should have been changed
i'm so glad to see many positive reviews for rocky . this is my favorite boxing movie of all time in january or february 1976 i was a young boxer training at the main street gym , los angeles california when got call from manager/trainer mel epstein telling me that they were filming about life marciano he asked if would like be an extra well course said yes as it turns out not making bio under way had chance meet sylvester stallone very impressed since only other ever seen him lords flatbush yet superstar later become infact really unknown however nice guy picture with and i've blown up into 8 x 10 it's pride joy long ago case anybody interested scene mickey are argueing after his gear removed locker hung on skid row upper right hand corner ring that's screen sparring monroe brooks who state champ by wearing off white tan colored trunks head actually these navy swim believe red matters but just identification he's black (i hate doing that) burgess meredith lunch (my trainer) picked brain character filmed three days paid forty dollars day have done free get oscar dissapointed did best actor award funny kids always tease know showing whenever someone over first tried stop because think embaresses them classic story underdog gets shot respect reasons one movies definetly
it was the best boxing movie ever !
i have seen all the rocky films hundreds of times and still dont get bored watching them it's very hard to say witch is best many people find 5th one be quite crap but that might just cause there was i'm sure if 2nd or 3rd film wouldnt it . what better story could you ask for a no name guy world icon because he went distance with champ when stallone made had got idea from muhammad ali fight (i cant rember who fought) inspired ali's apponent taking so much beating keep cumming back avetually knocked down home three days strait wrote entier script even rote fighting manovers they where going use heard there's 6th comming out hope dose aswell as others
the rocky series are my favourite films ever for so many reasons , acting fighting and everything else is all brill ! also brought hope to little guy in which they never get a chance (or rockys case got shot at decent title) line of whole film has be rockyiv where apollo(just b4 his fight)says i feel like could eat nails stallion replies i'v seen them snails garden but wanted every time see that clip always laugh . after watching roughly 30times still dont know thats how good these are.i heard rumour rockyvi on cards steps back into ring 1 more we no when says just one fight he really means another 20.hope true.rocky
best movies i've ever seen!! !
great
all of the rocky movies were great , i especially liked 3 one . are
everyone loves the italian stallion . it is a great story of how underdog can rise up and become champion world , even beating mr t russian
this is one of those movies i did not want to see but was glad . a young man named rocky who boxer chosen play against apollo creed professional loved the fact that movie about underdog sylvester stallone very good as and he wisely showed human side rocky.with his dertimination work out be hs crush on woman dating her.i found myelf realing caring character rooting for him.a well done
a simple guy with goals but who conquered the world...who couldn't like movie that whether it's sports or something else ?
this was a good movie . i like boxing movies and is my favorite one am also big fan of sylvester stallone
gotta see it . is old but very cool
great all time classic . full of action it is a bit cheesy to think rocky making , but gives everyone the feeling hope for doing and becoming their dreams
this is one of my favorite movies . i loved the storyline fighting also good movie really shaped american culture with catch phrase yo adrian  , and tough guy image rocky
great story of triumph and success . even more amazing that stallone wrote the screenplay best boxing movie i have ever seen
i still watch rocky today , so you know it was good when first came out . the best because towards end he always had style to him
it's great because about a super underdog who gets break and takes advantage of it . he also the chick wanted
greatest boxing movie of all time . the script was originally written by sylvester stallone it shows outstanding triumph human spirit had to actually train box , making that much more awesome
rocky is a symbol of underpriviledged america rising up from the depths to overcome all odds and be champion . although doesn't win fight , he truly victor i've seen this movie over twenty times i still love it
this was the ultimate american hero movie . it had an underdog , love and of course a wonderful ending where wins hurray rocky !
written and directed by sly stallone it provided an in depth look at the struggle of italians 80's . epic movie that started equally series
smart ! scary great characterization need i say more.. . loved it
an absolute classic . who doesn't get goosebumps during those training scene when that song starts playing , and sly puts on his game face the blue collar residents of philadelphia rally around him i mean come this is what movies are all about
an american classic - stallone was at his best .
rocky is a movie that can motivate even the most unmotivated person to succeed
rocky is my favorite movie b/c it gives me inspiration for life .
this is a great movie , i believe tom cruise's best acting performance and jack nicholson does an amazing job . the exchange between these two at end of in court room probably greatest scene history moviedom one have seen
i love demi , think jack is terrific even tom was good.. .
this movie includes one of the great court scenes ever done in a . i'm can handle truth : was fantastic
what a captivating , compelling military drama which is nearly perfect in every department . solid story and phenominal acting alone makes this film worth watching jack nicholson gave his best performance ever delivering those famous lines : you can't handle the truth !  prior to after saying that was just so intense it me wonder why he didn't win oscar tom cruise also at top of game equally courtroom scene with truly will thrill keep on edge your seat from start finish unmissable
a powerful look into corruption in the military and debate between following orders v obeying your personal consience .
nicholson at his best . jack plays playing a hardcore usma colonel heading up the base guantanamo bay tom cruise cocky , young military defense attorney kiefer sutherland as nicholson's conniving lieutenant portrays slimeball accomplice perfectly and kevin bacon jagcorps da gets that part to tee combine all of with splendid direction by rob reiner you've got courtroom drama since inherit wind oscars ? no they don't give movies make you feel good about but after 9-11 maybe should reconsider
why jack nicholson did not win an oscar for his performance is completely beyond me . the whole you can't handle truth outburst was one of all-time examples great acting oh , yeah everybody else (tom cruise demi moore etc.) a pretty good job fast paced thriller that never runs out steam anybody know who played dawson and downey ? i'd like to well that's enough my babbling take care everyone
a must see
this movie kicked ass ! i have seen it like 50 times . it's sooo cheesy and predictable but totally cool just really good exciting , arnold is kinda' sexy his wifey kicks everybody should see
all i have to say is two names : tom cruise and aaron sorkin . the best director writer seen in a long time he finally got recognized 2000 at emmy's for his talent few good men has great looking guys believable plot as what might happen weak member of military squadron
very entertaining . after i saw it felt like going to law school
jack nicholson's has the greatest court speech ever . intriguing story that keeps you glued to your seat interesting look into military life
love the story . intense i can watch it over and again tom cruise jack nicholson
great performances by high profile actors . tom cruise was fabulous as a lawyer , not to mention attractive intracite plot that i could follow
this movie i rated a 5 because it emotionally touched me in way that changed my life . opened eyes to view the world whole different
one of the bests casts ever in a movie . intensity and emotion came from this cast jack nicholson tom cruise were great
this fast-paced movie kept my attention from start to finish . it tells the story of two marines accused killing a fellow soldier and investigation that follows with gripping plot excellent acting across board (tom cruise , demi moore jack nicholson star) few good men is winner favorite scene in courtroom you can't handle truth !
true lies was a very good movie . it full of action and excitement from the first scene to last , there all kinds
the trial scenes are really intriguing , especially final one . i don't like tom cruise being lawyer though he doesn't have lawyer-kind-of face hate his acting too jack nicholson does a great job! !
demi moore in uniform (sigh) i think i'll go and have a lie down
i wish this movie would have been hours longer . the story was compelling as love between them think that in our american history books we glorify people and gloss over reality exchange for heroes showed what believe a much more accurate description of average soldier , ignorant narrow-minded masterpiece !
true lies was a good action movie and arnold schwarzenneger is character who plays an undercover agent that guy . that's why i like this because it has comedy plot
i liked this movie because it showed american indians as wonderful people , not savages . how the settlers took advantage of poor kevin costner looked pretty hot in
i was born on the day that movie came out
it's great because it shows how a man can change into something unexpected . he also gets the chick
this was a beautifully filmed movie . it presented part of history rarely shown in film , which great the rich colors and landscape added so much to how received captures essence that time period
the drama movie dances with wolves was a very well directed . story incorporated true history as fiction beautifully without making it boring heart-wrenching and actors played their roles brilliantly
great epic . sad , melancholic honest on the cruelty and stupidity of american soldiers bs war non compassion good prevails
i don't care how much is incorrect , this was a great movie !
a classic among american classics ! this frontier story was masterful portrayal of drama and emotion . one costner's best
an all time favorite . scorsese's best ; de niro's a classic
a groundbreaking powerhouse of movie ! one the finest acting performances all time by de niro and inspired direction scorsese . disturbing but brilliant deserves it's cult status how did this not win any oscars ? still gives me goosebumps in boom , scene..
what the heck is everyone thinking ? this movie should be at top .
another brilliant film from the '70s . deniro and scorsese team up for second time have created a masterpiece on subject of loneliness despair foster is superb as 14 yr old hooker that saves part his redemption
it takes balls to make a movie like this and no one else could have pulled off besides martin scorsese . there is dark underworld the human soul which id reflected by de niro's character , travis bickle i don't care how much anyone denies in us all
de niro kicks ass . one of his best roles he's a complete lunatic nut
illustrates how the anonymity of city coupled with its sweetness can drive a person into feeling deep isolation . taxi driver points out growing trend in society- people's need to be noticed all people feel significant , however some do it positively and negatively twist irony end makes clear that society is very distorted they make this deranged hero without knowing who he really we must careful choosing glorify
a man stands alone...he is an outsider . unknown but shy and curious he wants friend can't can help doesn't understand do you want to push further...let us take slow ride through the life of insane preacher !
one of the best movies i have ever seen ! robert deniro was fabulous at portraying this character whom you want to dislike but same time feel sorry for him . great film
taxi driver is a great movie that portrays loneliness .
this movie rocked . tia carrere is fine arnold really buff the action was good , too
matt damon and ben affleck at their best ! this is one of the great movies late 90's .
my all time favorite movie . it's the kind of that hits home on so many levels i never get sick watching it
md is rad
this film was simply brilliant . matt damon and ben affleck wrote story when they were struggling young actors wanted to break into the industry a simple set in their hometown of boston some main characters based on irish-american roots people who accussed being too overlooked what makes great which is heart soul , well written script intelligent dialogue that seems be lacking many films today monologue professor delivered will at lake one most gripping moving emotional speeches i've ever heard alone made movie stand out
not only is it a thriller , but it's also for families . my younger siblings loved great just enough action comedy and love story almost chick flick
great story and matt damon robin williams are excellent . who doesnt like this movie ? i reallywant to know
see , here's a movie for which matt damon can be fairly judged because of his excelent acting . one the best movies all time robin williams is such an inspiration was at !
a great movie that involves one man's struggle to cope with his own inability pursue success due personal insecurities of not only trust , but incapability move forward in life .
this is a fantastic movie . it's entertaining , intellectual yet fun easy to relate and the characters are memorable robin williams was great
great movie . after watching it , i feel like studying
true lies was a good movie and it had nice killing all through the . is in movies makes more real
this movie is an absolute triumph . the character collaboration and conflict ingenius , every emotion played on heart opened thought explored incredibly responsible bit of filmmaking wonderfully edited divinely written it prods into human spirit as few others have done before trailing life boy/man genius will hunting we see him in love pain cornered forced to face his past present future insanely gifted man interact with a variety characters including psychiatrists bar buddies childhood friends fellow geniuses (with explainable amount contempt) girls he both accelerated hindered by unheard brain power good bad sides talents are robin williams minnie driver ben affleck give performances comparable damon's own surprisingly casey portraying stupidest bloke boston foil delivers performance evoke humor pity all involved deserve commendation watch again
this movie changed my life . i love everything about : the writing , acting and direction ben affleck matt damon robin williams gave outstanding performances education boston is one of best
this movie is one of my favs because it has matt damon and ben affleck , two very good guys actors . the a plot i also love robin williams
well written script , where all characters were fully realized . the audience got to understand each character's motivations and desires fears very interesting watch main character will hunting because he was so complex violent vulgar on one hand but a genius funny other this movie had great message underlying : everyone should find their potential we shouldn't waste our lives are only alive for short time
hot guys and an original story . i love the accents of real pain matt damon shows in his role as will hunting
this movie is about a genius who's stuck in job going nowhere , and city . he reads to learn has the gift of understanding almost anything solves math problems that even professors can't solve wins girl wanted at end
appealing to both men and women . has a great cast was hollywood success story for matt damon ben affleck
good will hunting probably remain my favorite movie for a long time to come . i think that it left me thinking two days about confronting hurts and seeing people from within is beyond great !
matt damon is hot . he's great i watned to be my best friend
this movie was an original . the fact that arnold a secret agent and his wife didn't know about it made hillarious , especially when they were on mission together i loved one of my favorites
this is a great movie and wonderfully written screenplay by matt damon ben affleck . robin williams are both excellent as the thug/genius therapist , respectively it also includes one of greatest lines in recent history how do you like them apples!! !
i really enjoyed this movie . matt damon does a good job playing the tough guy , tormented working class genius while robin williams (whom i'm not normally big fan of) is outstanding as therapist who only barely keeping it all together chemistry between and why works with story line excellent acting likeable characters - highly recommended
i loved good will hunting . it was so remember seeing in the theater right when came out and wondering who cute guys were usually don't cry movies shed a few tears shocked to hear that matt damon ben affleck had written screenplay made me like movie ten times more
incredibly powerful movie . masterfully made robin williams was at his best(which is awesome) , and this me a fan of matt damon
i loved good will hunting . believe genius runs all through our society among the poor , rich as well various ethnic groups however we live in a where this is not often recognized arts music and other fields should be exposed to everything only few kinds of creative endeavors are
i think this movie was the best of year .
i loved that movie ! it was very emotional . robin williams is a great actor
this movie was just filled with talent . julia roberts as shelby lovable sally fields maylynn shelbys mother a great performance darryl hannahs character irritating shirley maclaine and olympia dukakis were hilarious especially when they did scenes each other those 2 my favorite its funny sad happy all in one
very sad .
i loved this movie . the cast of characters is wonderful it's by far best film julia roberts , sally field dolly parton or darryl hannah have ever been in-either then since guess it would be considered a chick flick but bring some hankys girls tear jerker interaction between women fantanstic-each has her own personality and we see how each one changes grows more than others hannah's character probably most in my opinion all field's husband are marvelous
a great movie ! i thought the whole cast was . it is listed as drama , but had number of hillarious scenes in espcially loved scene with shelby's wedding and red velvet cake shaped like an amarillo.and not just for chicks this will make you laugh cry really good
this is one of my all time favorite movies ! it's the only thing i actually enjoyed julia roberts in .
this has to be the greatest movie ever made .
one of my favorite dramas . it is the definition stunning beautiful film
classic . for some reason ('can't put my finger on it) , f murray abraham as salieri was phenominal
one of my favorite movies all time !
a favorite . no one's sure how accurate we can deem it but i certainly enjoyed the story and helped me to appreciate mozart more
this...is...perfection . an absolutely marvelous period epic , inspirational and essential brilliant funny one of the greatest films 80s it scooped up a gradiose 8 academy awards 1984 including best picture which highly deserves i bought this movie on vhs because loved so much wow ! can't recommend enough just two words : see summary
this film tries and succeeds at adapting a play in which mozart is hated by one of his contemporaries . salieri's hatred never really developed well other than mozart's arrogant slight salieri , but the movie does very chronicling life composer relationship with both wife father for anyone interested type period work it must see not just dialogue plot music make
although i rate this as a great movie , could never figure out why saleri hated mozart so much...time and again the 'reason' is shown in film but jealous idolized . scene particular when mozarts wife constanze takes originals to for his 'approval' bring into royal court they are becoming penniless...he says music 'miracleous' drops on floor steps upon them he walks refusing give any sort of consideration throughout entire constantly claims devotion him...anyway !
this is one of the favorite movies my youth . even though it's a period film , really funny actor who played main character did great job
amadeus was a great movie because just about every part of it flawless . the acting , storyline costumes set....it also extremely believable and way mozart's music incorporated with scenes
amadeus is a great movie for its cinematic efforts ! this that tries to show the true lives of mozart sake telling story , not just made put actors in costume .
if you enjoyed this movie , then ought to read mozart bywolfgang hildesheimer . was a very twisted perverted genius
excellent film . sure there are some inaccuracies in it but who cares it's entertainment and at that very engaging , really draws you f murray abraham is absolutely transfixing this he does an incredible job as the aged saliery his expressions mannerisms speech spot on if you've missed then out
from its debut on the theatrical stage to cinematic reproduction , story of worlds most renowned prodigy has found place among great stories all time . film portreal mozart brings with it more than a though including excelent acting and one thing that remained unparalleled in movie making best soundtrack
aside from the useless profanity , this ron howard-directed classic combines great science good acting and special effects with an upbeat ending ! highly recommended
outstanding !!! ! ron howard really did his homework on this one . the story is well written and actual facts are as damn close to truth possible in hollywood use of props nasa footage made movie a real look into history i think intent was inform you more than entertain , bolth say boring three guys floating around broken tin can shows lack inteligence that particular viewer apollo 13 true it happened an important date areospace portraies
i'm 35 and was just a small child when this happened . i don't remember it at all liked the movie happy to learn about those heroes had never heard of before
good film . it is an accurate and legendary recreation of the apollo 13 incident i highly reccomend this brilliantly directed by ron howard tom hanks has a career performance
a great learning tool about leadership styles
this movie made my a list when i first saw it . is one of the best protrayals actual american history have ever seen , and really brings out some work necessary to bring about greatest technological achievement all time amount danger in which astronauts could easily find themselves tom hanks his series on apollo missions thirteen episode concentrates aspects separate from those portrayed allows become working part kevin bacon gary sinise greatness film while portrays pain aborting lunar landing if you haven't should anyone even vaguely interested space will be impressed
tom hanks , gary sinease and kevin bacon all portray the astronauts of apollo 13 remarkably . musical score is very beautiful movie heartwarming yet suspenseful
tom hanks directed a winner . very compelling and enjoyable to watch
one of the great moments in cinema history when kevin plays catch with his dad- makes me cry like a baby every time i see it .
a very well-done movie with feel-good attitude through almost the entire film . great performances from james earl jones and kevin costner don't hurt , along scenery ending as well !
this is my all time favorite movie . every minute of it was great , i didn't even mind his annoying hippie wife costner acted with a little personality and lioatta did job playing joe lancaster everyone story brought tear to eye more than once remember the first saw on usa moved like never before think could be emotionally effected by movies very wrong
w p kinsella is an american treasure and this movie may actually be as good his book (titled shoeless joe) . costner the always-excellent james earl jones shine like angels if you baseball movies , i love them a great film don't moves but films about characters who persevere follow their dreams still
wow , not just a baseball movie . i loved it for variety of reasons but really think that 'baseball' was vehicle the expression sorrow regret and reconciliation between father son watched maybe dozen times last 20 minutes always chokes me up we all look at our parents differently when get older usually an opportunity to mend fences kevin costner's character had no way reconcile with his dad except thru field dreams james earl jones is great in supporting role provides many quotes final scenes
i think this was the best and most beautiful baseball movie ever it had all greats made even people who didn't like love game !
just a baseball game ? yeah , well it shows how if we listen to our inner voices new life can emerge out of what seems like hopeless situation . all are in search field dreams.. and have too
while i would not bother seeing any of kevin costner's recent movies , field dreams is a timeless story that watch anytime . it showcases the heartwarming spirit associated with baseball got shivers when 'shoeless joe jackson' emerged from cornfields this should easily be america's favorite movie about pasttime
eventhough i'm a 'chick' , i liked it very much .
show it , and i will come .
true lies was very unexpectedly excellent . i don't like arnold but think he did an awesome job and jamie lee curtis , for old woman she has a great body
as a closet tim burton fan , i was excited to see this film and while the odd pace of movie slowed me down bit wasn't disappointed . visual extravaganza for eyes filled with fanciful sights effects it delightful plot fun ambitious in its twists turns always wonderful ewan mcgregor charming heart-warming billy crudup also did fantastic job darling that definitely be given chance
nothing i could say even begin to give silence of the lambs praise it deserves . by far is best horror movie , although it's not original version (manhunter was first) words enough.. amazing
the air cav assault is a classic .
first thing to get straight is that this not meant be some cak comedy but an amusing satire on media power gone out of control . carrey at lasts drops the gurning and turns in a decent performance here viewing film up nice little surprises such as when he discovers his family isnt real much better than copycat films like ed tv , original thought provoking movie
the movie that proves jim carrey actually has acting talent . i love basic plot of which explored idea reality tv before actual fad hit airwaves in form survivor and big brother if you want a comedy then this isn't for , but you're looking well written acted explores somewhat controversial issue is your
the redux version fills in some holes and makes more sense . watch that if you can
this is basically the only film where i can actually watch jim carrey - he's being an actor instead of a cartoon character and he pulls it off really well . whole point to question just how much media influences controls us from day extent that company adopts baby creates false world for him everyone in his life , friends family even wife are actors reflects we get sucked into shows believe characters be real plot good with truman realising living breaks free heartwarming definately teh best role carey's career
incredable preformance by jim carrey . perhaps his first drama , this movie really makes you think about life could be but just another truman in a world modified especially for i walked out of the theater pondering stupid quetion have not yet found an answer forget screenwriter's name at moment what marvelous idea he(they) had amazing story
it's amazing how they have sort of the big brother theme , where are taping truman's life into a 24/7 tv show . it was really an intriguing movie
maybe not the greatest , but has to be seen in 70mm widescreen and full stereophonic sound really appreciate this film . a large theatre with at least 65 foot screen
it's a movie for everyone , would like it . eventhough jim carrey isn't being funny he's very good and entertaining
truman show was funny . i liked it thought a comedy though jim carrey did an excellent job in this movie he is wonderful actor
i thought jim carrey had a very sensitive and convincing role in this movie . it made me ask questions about myself like what perceive as reality the idea was original well cast think should have been nominated for an oscar
i loved it ! the idea imagine living your whole life(using bathroom , masturbating digging noise taking a crap) not knowing that rest of world is watching you too . there someone controlling environment and are just guinea pig in some aliens experiment or something scary it's kind like matrix way cool
movie is not only funny , but justified . violence and language kept to a minimum true life doesn't have unnecessary stuff pump ratings
i like the movie because it relates to my life and did not think a could touch heart way this has .
this show has something extra - it remains with you long after it's over , raising questions bringing up new perspectives etc . jim carrey was a good choice but he didn't seem completewly restrained to me there were few the top moments these balanced though by some incredibly acting
out of all the jim carrey movies i've seen , this is best ! it's so real.. .
i loved this movie ! jim carrey did a wonderful job . at first it was confusing , but after you wantch few times it's easy to understand think one of the best movies that has done
this film was very special for me ! i felt like it that had written the manus or maybe movie about ? reason topics of , what if everyone knows you're doing all time etc . thoughts i've a lot as child one greatest movies at :o)
hilary swank is awesome . imo
i was dragged to this .  .i had my mind made up before saw it- pc junk boy wrong a solid dramatic film based on real events hillary swank (who clearly has left her awful karate kid movie behind her) terrific and believeable good .but unpleasant watch the final violent sequence- be warned
an incredibly powerful and intense movie . it reminded me of american history x with the atmosphere mood story its setting characters are all wonderfully developed , is very interesting way through hillary swank was oscar-material her amazing performance in this film a emotional true well worth watching highly reccomended !
i'm a bit late in coming on this , but i count boys don't cry as among one of my favorite films . it is raw powerful disturbing and heartwrenching hilary swank was amazing totally deserved the oscar ! supporting cast great well from chloe sevigny just-as-confused lover brandon to peter sarsgaard sociopathic killer john lotter first time saw wasn't too sure after watching few more times really got into story fact used live just over an hour where real teena murdered (i now omaha) hit close home seeing movie helped me become obsessed with case i've been falls city seen house her grave lincoln blows your mind that something like happened america 1993 along lines racial lynching south 1920s right under our noses we were sitting theaters stunned schindler's list yes might be very uncomfortable for many watch it's such important film if you can't handle then must have problem reality not freaky stuff goes film- did dress man date women sex them get pants pulled down she raped no good reason make kind up folks people need open their hearts minds little realize there are still country day who harassed beaten even killed because they does name matthew sheppard ring bell anyone ? he will go history tragic martyrs gay/transsexual rights movement
i loved this movie,and if there is only 1 reason why it should receive 5* , it's because of the incredible amount work that went into on all levels to create a brilliant piece art.the opening songby doors flying dutchman can get no satisfaction by stones and especially hendrix solo in outpost scene are one best songs chosen for film ever seen.wow.as rest its qualities...too short here.brilliant .
this is an incredibly powerful film . and it heart-wrenching , make no mistake about the performance by hillary swank utterly amazing chloe sevigny also fantastic in her role will homophobic among us quite uncomfortable i'm sure if you can keep open mind heart feel for these people deeply care what happens to them brandon teena not portrayed as a perfect person but human being with faults dreams needs that are shunned most around him things do happen real life choose recognize sheds light on intolerance pioneering honest way i can't recommend highly enough
i haven't seen it , but want to . there's just a response would like make toddsternohio are you sure student of film and cinematography or narrowminded idiot???? ? have never read so much crap that makes me feel angry did know the human body has male female hormones if there was an imbalance then person either be more feminine masuline been many cases where should born as other sex people in this world who succeed dressing up opposite getting away with surely watch jerry springer show - get lots man decides woman boyfriend he doesn't japan men transform themselves into women look very realistic my sister gets mistaken for young boy were saying....
it was really sad and kinda messed up too , but a great movie
this story first appeared in vanity fair about two years ago , and at that time i was both saddened intrigued the life of brandon teena . movie very well done acting excellent it touched upon a relevent subjuect : hatred persecution gay women
not since shindlers list have i felt so devastated by a film.truly one of the most effective movies to ever been made .
it is hard to rate this movie . there are so many disturbing things about 'boys don't cry' that makes say great ! on the other hand , done well as i have no choice but a 5 story girl who really boy inside (but born with parts) goes new town and discovers love young acting amazing forgot she was he put together in all aspects director did job
this movie kicks ass!! ! you have to see it . however , remember that is very intence
this movie was excellent . very shocking and eye opening living in a somewhat liberal city makes you blind think that sort of discrimination doesn't happen the story well told , gripping
the movie follows book fairly well . while depressing from beginning until very end , shows a slice of life that is real for some i think pain experienced by todays youth whether it's related to sexual identity or acceptance and belonging in general
i saw boys don't cry on campus and really liked the movie . topic was fresh acting very convincing thought that it did not try to sugarcoat what is obviously a emotional , this made stick in my mind as powerful
this movie is superb . hillary swank was incredible she a wonderful actress the poignant and heavy fact that it real made more intense it's downer , but worth watching !
i've never seen a real-life movie that was this good . it presented controversial topic in way can open people's minds the acting great hilary swank deserved her award for portrayal of brandon
this movie should and will leave you sobbing . it takes on an emotional roller coaster , from sublime to heartbreak the tragedy is that true it's so sad when realize people can be cruel (more conservative might not enjoy flick but i suggest they see anyway open their eyes.)
i've only seen the redux , but since they added a nude scene i don't mind . lots of carnage surealism and kilgore was hilarious
a totally awesome movie that is the first to make me cry in long time . itself very cathartic afterwards you feel exhausted emotionally
hillary swank did a remarkable job at portraying brandon teena . an oscar well deserved !
this movie is well worth the price of admission . hilary swank gives a stellar and convincing portrayal brandon tina i highly recommend to everyone keep in mind it bit disturbing
i wish there was a six-star rating for this one . it is so important to see a) because the story devastating and revealing really happened , b) hilary swank astonishing deserves rise up from her seat next sunday take home that oscar unbelievable
boys don't cry is an awesome film  , with great cast especially hilary swank as brandon teena she ia absolutley amazing that's why won the golden globe for best actress and probably oscar i hope so . go see it
hilary swank's performance as brandon teena was phenomenal . there is an oscar award this young woman's future! !
i was a little cynical about seeing this because of the mixed reviews i'd received it . now only wonder who could dislike one critic described as two most powerful films all time , right up there with godfather well guy pretty much hit nail on head by end movie unable to get from my seat and still had word horror playing in for three more hours colenol kurtz is an outstanding representation every single aspect hell vietnam war scenes walking through island near cambodia bodies everywhere heads scattered over ground were say least shocking what's worse that things like probably happened take care everyone !
i loved everything about this movie.i think it should have won the acadamy award,even though shakespear in love was good .cate made movie for me,she got best actress award,she screwed.the music terific costumes,the actors,it me want to learn more elizabeth and english history general .
an excellent movie . it has all- mystery , action political intrigue and sex fabulous costumes scenery lush cinematography this was gyped of its oscars by shakespeare in love
beautiful costumes and great casting . brings forth queen elizabeth in a whole new light that attracts young people
this movie gives insight to a woman's life that is major part of history . until i saw did not realize what kind she went through am glad the storyline wasn't changed too drastically from actual historical events
i thought this was a good movie . didn't think i'd like it at first elizabeth led an interesting life and learned little bit about her as well being entertained
cate blanchett was superb as elizabeth , she deserved the oscar . a brilliant portrayl of virgin queen i believe that it matters very little there may be small historical innacuracies in movie for 'elizabeth' inspires watcher learn more about themselves
now this was a very well-done historical film ; kate blanchett's steely white face without doubt will flicker before my eyes everytime i read british history . both accurate and intriguing , came to life in all its costumes turning an otherwise dull chapter of monarchy into magnificent saga sacrificial triumph elizabeth the queen feminist-whoever would have thought
put the god damn dog in bucket ! that creepy cross dressing naked pee hiding man still enters my nightmares once a while . i think this is most frightening psychological thriller have ever seen strangely , started to like hannibal and demented relationship he was creating with agent starling may be sick but classic you can watch over again freaked out
there are many great war films out , but apocalypse now is certainly the greatest of them all . although technically not a film it deals with thoughts and ideas that could only be conjurred in act thus i classify as such this showcases francis ford coppola's director skills even more so than his godfather (although endlessly arguable)
absolutely positively the best period piece ever ! love won lost inspiration for women wishing to kick butt in a man's world .
two thumbs up! ! one of the best movies ever! i really recommend everyone to watch this . was very disappointed when it didn't get academy award think film deserves cate blanchett should've won actress too
wonderful thought provoking film and [thankfully] no-one being blown up , chased....not much action but emotion
very touching movie with two old veterans , henry fonda and katharine hepburn . they are both hilarious heartwarming as the aging couple who spending another summer in their lake home relationship have well relationships daughter her fiance soon to be stepson gets stuck there them all right on target it rings true you can't help but laugh at even though he's spouting obscenities half time
one of the greatest movies all time , definitely !
francis ford coppola directed 3 of the greatest films 70s . godfather  , part ii and course apocalypse now captain willard (martin sheen) must track down kill a man who has gone crazy is running mini-empire in depths vietnam (i'm not sure name guy but marlon brando played him) simple enough story this movie one made ever it's haunting experience from tigers to arrows robert duvall's i love smell napalm morning...smells like victory jungle-crazy reciting t.s eliot around piles severed heads ultimate trip if you haven't seen magnificent film you're see it brilliant summary : best 'nam war top 50
simply wonderful - not much action but charged emotion  , seen it several times
great acting by old actors . script
wow... . my favorite movie the plot line , actors and directing were fabulous this was a psychological thriller without any major actions scenes it made me evaluate what/how i see things would defintley recommend to an older audience (not young teens) deserved awards they got for their roles in film!! !
russell crowe can flat-out act . jennifer connelly gives an exceptionally fine performance as well
this movie was excellent . very intriguing story of mathematical genius with a profound life-debilitating illness i fascinated how his delusions were made to seem so real know someone personally affected by schizophrenia and opened my eyes little more about the victims lives are taken over their imaginings truly touched me , shed tear russell crowe is an actor
beautiful mind is a movie . the story of john nash , in itself fascinating but russell crowe's protrayal stellar piece acting crowe would have gotten his second straight oscar for that role had it not been an episode behaving badly to film exec just before oscars jennifer connelly goddess-like this her well deserved scott glenn as always excels depicts horrors going through life paranoid schizophrenic nash's eventual triumph overwhelmingly emotional my favorite parts when cogent and lucid he was genius highest magnitude way demonstrated nobel prize winning theory economic equilibrium (using example picking up women at bars) one neatest things i've seen movies
the best war movie of all time ! very smart . around bad ass
this movie hits home . i have an uncle who has schizophrenia classictvfan , how could you not be moved by ? it's a true story of man's real suffering do feel sorry for him he didn't ask to that way sometimes hope bias against the mentally ill which would hurt my feelings very much because severe clinical depression raises awareness about disease inspiring and beautiful
an amazing and powerful movie . a moving depiction of schizophrenia well written acted i could almost say that russell crowe is possibly the best actor working today
without doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen . it`s quite simply brilliant
fantastic! ! this movie will be used in abnormal psych classes for years to come due its remarkable portrayal of schizophrenia . disorder is sorely misunderstood and shows it not just a skid row problem russell crowe was flawless jennifer connelly earned her oscar (although i thought co-star requiem dream had an equally compelling performance)
if you want to understand mental illness , this is the movie see .
a very well done movie.this is based on the life of mathematician john nash . russell crowe did wonderful job portraying and his battle with schizophrenia i really felt for demons that he delt mental illness this movie showed real brutal honesty about how hard it must be to deal schizophrenia.ron howard won much deserved oscar directing would recommend bit too long though
great story based on true
words fail me . i saw this film for the first time , today and cannot even begin to tell you how absolutely stunning it is francis ford coppola has gained my vote as one of cinema's greatest filmmakers godfather part ii are his achievements but apocalypse now a tour de force movie
i thought it was a great movie from the story to acting of course directing . kept my constant attention it's kind you walk away and can't stop thinking talking about hubby's first words after ended , makes feel like never too late go out accomplish whatever want made us laugh cry wonderful performance by russell crowe he really very real were right there going thru all with him (mr nash)
it's a great movie , and please do not read ellajedlicka's comment if you wish to see it with any element of surprise or suspense . i'll say got my mind turning in areas psychology made me excited about the potnetial life
it is the true story of mathematics and economics genius john nash his terrible struggle with paranoid schizophrenia . he has delusions a roommate at princeton (where attending graduate school) niece as well an f.b.i agent that supposedly making him code-breaker to save world from nuclear attack in early '50s mental illness made apparent when psychiatrist takes asylum gives electric shocks try eradicate lifelong becomes threat others starts teach still suffering wins nobel prize 1994 for economic theory materialized late '40s while was school really makes seem like real people so you can see what schizophrenic think their inability discern reality imagination very touching movie little sad this guy suffer much
no oscar marterial , but an intriguing film with a few good lessons to be learned . russell crowe's characters' schizophrenia had sort of double meaning...he saw the world diferently than others did like i noticed that everyone seemed have blue eyes and else thought was insane...guess i'm only one who it this probably best movies i've seen all year (up there life as house ) if directors don't wake up start making couple really films may end winning deserving most awards overall pretty ron howard job outstanding acting by crowe co take care !
tom hanks got an oscar but denzel should have gotten one too . he was awesome as learned about human compassion and to throw bitotry out the window this movie moving compelling told a necessary story aobut treatment of people with horrible disease
tom hanks is great as a lawyer who has aids he hides it long can until the symptoms become more obvious , when his lawfirm finds out they fire him . hires well played by denzel washington to defend him.shows prejudice and ignorance those have against people very done movie tear jerker at times
a classic court drama , and tom hanks was perfect .
tom hanks and denzel washington were great . this really has to open people's eyes what its like live with something as stigmatizing aids should be mandatory for all people watch
this film really gets to me - its so powerful . the story is quite simple tom hank's character a lawyer who has aids and when his employers didn't know , he was hotshot had bright future within company they made homophobic jokes 'had laugh' it became obvious that ill got sacked for 'misplacing very important file' hanks decides fight them enlists denzel washington help him happens be but agrees throughout you see friendship between two develop denzel's reach an understanding about gay people how trial affects tom's family partner disgusting former were even their hates doing case there are many moments in will make cry big time i did
this movie sets an example all families should follow if their son , brother etc . comes out to them i was touched by acceptance and it pains me when hear from other gay men know how they have been shunned family immensely as many others were
an emotional , moving film with a superb performance by tom hanks as gay lawyer aids . i loved the way that movie brought rebuke and scorn to ignorant homophobics damage they can cause systems of homosexuals (and some heterosexuals) throughout entire was rooting for hanks' character win fight must-see everyone especially ; good deal them need realize what do say gays is mental stab in back see why won oscar his performance...one my all-time favorite movies take care !
talk about a trip through hell ! apocalypse now is both real and surreal most definitely devastating . this movie captured the overall mood of viet nam era with all its emotional turmoil , political insanity feeling emptiness more completely than any other film i have ever seen saw it when was first released sat there wondering for awhile why theater seemed so odd then suddenly occurred to me as leaving that nobody in place had moved spoken or even gone bathroom last hour show
a brilliant and beautiful film , with sympathetic characters lovely moments - the opera scene final scenes representing hollywood at its best most powerful emotionally .
an incredible movie that came at a time when we needed it most . tom hanks is moving and quite amazing as the lawyer afflicted with aids denzel washington becomes homophobic who takes on case not only does philadelphia explore professional prejudice against victims , brings us into personal world..the human side very touching sometimes difficult to watch i specifically remember scene after costume party (washington trying discuss sings translates aria) effective if have explain was lost you must see
a nihilistic descent into schizophrenic madness that i can't stop watching . maybe it's the intricate photographic work , fincher's ear for dialogue spellbinding performances by ed norton helena bonham carter meatloaf and brad pitt all of aforementioned.....it's an obsessive relationship never want to end from opening "needle drag" dust brothers intro you're swept dreary dirge norton's anticipated existence (recounted through jarring skips flashbacks) suspecting ease with which he ends up dealing his insomnia-induced repression shot trenchant humor jabs at popular culture gnarly twists throughout you'll find yourself enjoying it little more than you should few "squirm shifts" time (and name is robert paulson) but title like "fight club" shouldn't expect shortbread high tea get disc see why this film instills such ardor among its legion loyal eager fans
a very good movie . the first time i watched it didn't get again and listened to an interview of ed norton , brad pitt then began since i've probably two or 3 more times pick up each it's brilliant film how see from beginning don't know twists turns this take really makes you pay attention think not that can flip back forth watch while you're doing something else norton-a fantastic actor pitt-more than just pretty face like when i'm alone so there are no distractions
great acting
my favorite movie ever
brad pitt and edward norton shine in this cutting edge drama . the whole movie is thrilling humerous i was on of my seat (couch) entire wow!! ! one favorite films all time no doubt about it
one of my favorite films .
what do you think
a cutting edge movie , through and . norton does another great job (i only knew him from rounders) somehow complements pitt pretty well the camera work was fascinating original
a brilliant film ! coppola's adaptation of conrad's novel is beautiful . apocalypse now cinematically excellent , and beautifully preformed martin sheen so convincing in that role his lack recognition for it crime
the greatest movie ever made .
hands down the best socially influential movie since pulp fiction and resivior dogs best(and probably only good) brad pitt . this is my bible
its my fav . movie ever if you havent seen this go buy it ! now not about fighting cant appreciate for what really means i feel bad wish could give 10 stars
awesome movie ! inspires lots of philosophical conversations .
why isn't this movie in the top 10?!? ! is by far one of best movies that i have ever seen brad pitt and ed norton are amazing , it really stays true to book .
it was ironic and very strange , i had no clue what going on untill the end confusing but if you think about story's good . bizzare ending who would've known ? film
francis ford coppola at his best . this is coppola's rendition of the classic heart darkness , set in vietnam war a glimpse into primitive evil inherent within men-see it cinematography awesome !
a powerful punch of movie . tough hard hitting drama , with edward norton as the nameless star pitt and bonham-carter are excellent in support but this is finchers film his direction faultless crafting music orchestrating editing to weave magic
my 5th favorite movie of all time .
the best movie ever made...thats that .
definantly a five star movie . its almost scary of how real the acting was you really dont get all sub messages that this gives off unless see it about four times your some badass and can name every little twist thing shows if want to will thinking,than is
what an amazing movie!!!!!haven't seen one that good in a long time . i really admire edward norton's work he's talented actor ! brad pitt was at his best just loved the end i'm optimist when it comes to judging movies..
david fincher always manages to direct the kind of films that take viewer deepest , darkest recesses psyche and have them relate it consciously or subconciously . fight club is a fine example this ! fincher's presentation film proves as his skill improving cynacism originality remain intact (the ikea scene was much lauded i know will be emulated in future.) script blew me away with it's colorful narration crisp dialogue acting phenomenal wasn't so edward norton surprised what i've seen talent he could play transvestite crying game us all completely fooled nor brad pitt who by way hasn't exuded personality since 12 monkeys  helena bonham carter fleshed out marla beautifully difficult sympathize her yet impossible hate well meatloaf surprising touching funny portrayal bob but let's talk about violence movie i'm going agree ploughman on one : signifigant clockwork orange should not missed watching word title expecting like faces death traumatized scenes are only representative norton's inner turmoil (as pointed insightfully) an lengths we go feel more alive complete society where becoming merely human counterparts technology create if you haven't watch let make imprint your mind find disturbing academy chooses recognize three-hour long drivel titanic english patient almost ignores brilliant insightful explorations into condition
by far one of the best films ever . edward norton is unbeleiveable ! brad pitt's role tyler twist was great and plot line strangley fascinating this movie all around
the kind of volatile subject matter which cannot and should not be tackled to often but fincher does it perfectly . top noch film ignore all pathetics who say is 'disturbing'
i hate to give any horror movie a great rating because them all but in terms of being very good at scary and the same time quite interesting as story well done have 5 stars silence lambs . intriguing , especially when she is down basement that house it's pitch black she's scrambling around trying get her bearing he's stalking slowly with his night vision goggles on oh man could you heart attack just thinking about there yourself under those conditions
this movie is an outright classic . never has a vietnam epic been depicted in such psychotic , yet moving fashion apocalypse now gives you moment to relax and just stare at the screen will constantly find yourself questioning sanity of characters definite must see
i felt had to rate this film point out an error a lot of people seem be making . the fighting that everyone is going mad about in , while being very accurate and thus nasty watch also supposed symbolise inner turmoil on within edward nortons charachter person who recommended it but fast forward fight scene's mis guiding scenes are as important rest story they give you actualisation his well my opinion anyway one more point- seems think main charachters name jack (nortons) if again will see he only adopts after reading article magazine found house shares with tyler- something jack's kidney or something- we never find it's not considered because all happens done by tyler opinionated- am right- your call !
i first saw this film when my partner brought back a pirate copy from khazackstan for 19th and loved it . at the beginning thought was imagining things an image of brad pitt is imposed onto frame in about 3 times very clever , you can see insominia building up with main character intresting concept acted out well
billiant acting . awesome cinematography great storyline , original funny very smart cool score/soundtrack music 10/10 best movie i've ever seen in my opinion
i thought this movie was fascinating . my favorite part all of the voice overs that edward norton did in his mellow monotone , esspecially am jack bits whole look film really intriguing everything from endless darkness to strange costumes bloody fight scenes i'll admit lost strength towards end as if wirter kind ran out steam none less it keeps you on edge your seat and leaves thinking
man , this is a stunning incredible movie . you should also check out the documentary about making of it's called hearts darkness : film maker's apocalypse won't forget it
exceptional . very deep twisted if you ever wanted to be virtually shashed by movie - go for it
many people expected something else . and so did i but like what got instead great film very interesting , creative funny weird shocking just perfect
fight club is the best movie ever created .
i was not disappointed at all in fight club ! went knowing anything about the film , and came out satisfied with acting themes (underlying apparent) as well twists . think am a rather observant person however totally caught off guard twist of this movie thought it provoking raw look into life ordinary man
someone will literally have to explain me what is wrong with this film . nothing great acting , an intersenting ending a message philosophy behind it and brad pitt one of the best i've seen year
a strange , dark descent into nihilistic fantasy . uneven yes.. and yet it's now one of my favourite movies
jessica tandy and morgan freeman dan ackroyd were awesome . it was fun to watch the relationship between grow plays tandys son as he tries make sure she is taken care of despite her stubborness
a very good film , retired jewish school teacher in the south with black man that her son hired to drive because she was old herself . it brought up bigotry illiteracy ageing all kinds of issues but most pretty subtle fashion relationship between driver morgan fairchild and jessica tandy changes throughout movie
i loved this movie . it was funny and sad like a that makes you laugh then brings tears is what real life
until last night , the only time i had seen this movie was in my 11th grade english so that we could write an essay comparing it to conrad's heart of darkness . it's really difficult get a sense 45 minute pieces boy am glad took second look is wonderful narrated incredibly by martin sheen follows his character capt willard as he goes further and up river into jungles vietnam terminate with extreme prejudice kurtz former military hero who has gone crazy tremendous performances entire cast notably robert duvall apocalypse now allows us see many horrors how men went there were changed forever you definitely have be right mood watch but if haven't make sure rent vivid pictures camera shots created coppola great acting will worthwhile
subtle acting of morgan freeman and jessica tandy with excellent supporting performances lupone aykroyd . very worthwhile-and entertaining
excellent movie . i would recommend for all age groups this shows how blacks were treated , not only in the past but now as well there are people who mean and cruel some respectful humane has/had context was enjoyed by
morgan freeman is always wonderful . this academy award winner full of humanity -- what a nice change pace from so much hollywood..
this is my alltime favorite movie . i even liked it better than the book based on , heart of darkness by joseph conrad music fit mood perfectly especially end doors
i think this movie is really cute and touching . the friendship between them was beautiful
this is the most intense movie i have ever seen . everything great about acting , directing and cinematography truly film aronosfky makes you feel characters pain with his direction
the finest acting in oughts (2000 to 2004) so far---the academy shamefully overlooked ellen burnstyn . her performance is heart of this incredible or difficult film you will not believe your eyes when see what she goes through jennifer connelly , jared leto and marlon wayans (appearing his first dramatic role) are equally believable anti-drug that does glamorize its subject matter least it's brilliantly directed--you feel as if on drugs with characters because direction a perfect
5 stars , but a reserved . an excellent movie that was also incredibly offensive and revolting at the same time why you ask ? depictions of lows human nature which characters enter are 100% disgusting if have weak stomach opposed to sex violence drug abuse etc. by all means do not watch this for those who can appreciate extremely strong anti-drug message in watching it will want again once is enough however one primary reasons i give its possible service considering/experimenting with/involved use catch your teenager using or experimenting with drugs preview strongly consider making them serve purpose fact generally well made find must great rating despite wanted vomit
this was an amazing film . i thought that the cinematography fantastic , and all though it quite graphic reality of very raw drew me in is emotional depressing but enthralling well done most definatley a movie you need to watch closely pay attention to- deep detailed 5 stars without doubt
great film .
this movie shocked me to no end- firstly because its in-depth , graphic look in the far-reaching use of drugs america and secondly acting was incredible . by far one most depressing films ever but obviously point film is not entertain it an unconventional disturbing piece meant cause you think dragged through so many emotions from disgust empathy nausea extreme sadness clearly a mvie for faint heart as depiction these character's lives relentless painful magnificent storyline touches deep chord
a visual masterpiece . many of the actors smoked weed and dropped acid in order to really get into their roles this movie has gritty , surealistic feel that definitely benefits from sacrifices passion francis ford coppolla
wow . this film was amazing , a true masterpiece movie really shows how drugs will destroy your life the unique way filmed is what makes it so great from each character's point of view yes ending devastating but do you expect drug addiction usually doesn't lead to happy even if don't like sad movies fascinate and hold full attention until horrifying one most powerful i have ever seen.
a disturbing , brilliant and heartbreaking movie . if anyone labels this as just another drug they need to look deeper see that requiem shows how someones pursuit of happiness can become an addiction ellen burstyn is someone you would never forget sara goldfarb in the end it was painful her slowly....rot must be shown high schools when there lecture on drugs unfortunantley due some graphic content will probably happen
have to rate this a 5 just because of ellen burstyn's amazing acting alone . it is quite unusual movie be so thought-provoking and hopefully will wake-up call some who are into drugs i had no idea what was about when put on surprising , depressing but very outstanding well done
i would recommend this movie ! it almost made me cry at the end
who needs dare when you have this movie? ! the performances were awe-inspiring . message of movie was one most poignant i ever seen it is shocking and very disturbing , but important much like schindler's list don't want to see stuff need in order understand world what can be done about we wondered validity hospital scene thinking that can't imagine would legal send him jail instead at least treating infection realize point they making already made by worked even better if longer showing how son got involved hard core drugs first place showed my kids while having explain believe gateway before heroin hoped feels good temporary feelings are not worth cost also addictive whether or less socially appropriate than another beautifully as a society shouldn't treat drug addicts criminals either torture doesn't solve anything process
this was a greatly powerful movie i used to be user myself but have since cleaned up my act and that hit on every nerve of emotions wet through all the pain suffering felt real . so almost well thats it good
a very hard hitting , relentless and sad film . the acting is superb especially by burstyn who deserved an oscar another 1000 awards directing editing just marvelous i love this
never has a film moved me so . i watched in awe the whole time but thing is , storyline=very average characters=so-so filmmaking...f*ckin unreal would kiss ground this director pisses on
first let me get a few random words of advice out the way : 1) don't see this movie on date , 2) eat dinner while watching and 3) expecting to feel good afterwards . requiem for dream is one most disturbing movies i've seen everything about it makes you uncomfortable - downward spiral each character relentless music jagged filming editing techniques.. acting performances are universally excellent ellen burstyn especially gives an amazing performance as lonely widow mother who falls victim diet pill addiction clearly not everyone but it's hard give such unconventional powerful film anything less than five stars
this movie is truly an incredible piece of art . i can not say was enjoyable  , but it both unforgetable and haunting while some people reviewed talking about the lack nudity that totally what acting elly burstyn should have won oscar for also music so important to especially in creating mood includes incredibly stunning last ten minutes definetly a director we be expecting great things from future
ive never had a movie touch me as much this one has . of the most depressing movies i have ever seen , but honest i've about drugs and how they can destroy relationship between mother her son two best friends perfectly happy couple after was over in awe didn't know what to say who it worse just amazed leto's performance amazing great see marlon wayans serious role ellen.. man everyone gave an outstanding score too beatifully directed i'm shocked that take home any oscars scince american beauty.a must see..
as a person with some retired habits of highly questionable nature , i feel comfortable informing you that this film does justice to the desperation and hopelessness heroin addiction . movie comes from book by hubert selby jr jennifer connelly ellen burstyn give exceptional performances was uncomfortable have been while watching since seeing panic in needle park it so powerful didn't realize had seen great motion picture until much later evening one those films makes like need shower immediately after viewing
well what to say.. . do i give this movie a high rating becasuse it effected me so ? or low because didn't effect in nice way becase changed --in blunt painful way--for the better feel good about fact that whole fcking was drug addiction and (andother) addictions don't usually end happily hmmm.. is dilemma.. i'm just really not sure. mean , like puppy dogs there were none.. that's minus. also enjoy chocolate sundae's with peanuts on top think best got shared icecream cone during summer segment-- fall winter thing stupid becasue who wants be left off middle of cold ! happened spring huh blooming flowers everyone else likes flowers!!!! yes todd agree your point nudity-- would have been more than appropriate for what's her name gotten naked-- enjoyed god's sakes-- c'mon she's hot girl problem should = sexy nudity scenes right course some piece equation im missing? seems fairly simple if you she at part where has go dance all those old drunk men stick petrolem jelly dildo up but nothing drugs life knows boyfirend as hopelessly addicted can't come back same reason-- might even money drugs-- wouldn't emotional danm could made an nicer profit herself time golly director writer man sure are missing common sense!!
this movie was brilliantly made and could go either way . you love it or hate even those who say they won't dare take there eyes off of from beginning to end one the greatest movies i ever saw
this film could quit possibly one of the most brilliant motion pictures ever made . no movie has me feel way did i read book over a year ago and is best adaptions director aronofsky next stanley kubrik cannot get performances ,the visuals,the score out my head since saw it will stick with forever beautiful,dark,scary,depressing brilliant.can you smell oscars ? mmmmmm...oh buy if are seeing just because might have chance to see t do not go only there none but about sex love , more specifically gone wrong nc-17 does nesacarily mean nudity requien highly disturbing beauty type who goes so they can home later masturbate pair breasts instead for ! still someone make choices we ourselves as much others when an addiction becomes strong destroys emotions caring toward ones that wrong.yes depths depravity people their fix in key subject film.yes within film,yes little yes graphic scene means getting point accros.sex part side note such deep thought provoking disapointed lack need step shallow kiddie pool into big kids pool.sometimes life than like meaning
it is really great to see a movie that doesn't cop out at the end . requiem for dream played my local art theater (for far too short of run)for about week i saw twice first time was completely blown away don't remember being so disturbed by film loved ellen burstyn should get more than an oscar nomination can't when all aspects making came together well as w/ ending selby writer imagine his words put into effectively wish could again !
movies like this you don't give five stars because they're warm and cuddly safe . i it for the honesty of its portrayals various downward spirals addictions to heroin speed add dazzling substantial direction editing by darren aronofsky which really puts in head wasted bodies addicts four most stunning performances have seen all year result is a film love appreciate high quality absolutely unflinching at one point , watching drug addict shoot up car could not watch any movie that makes me squirm usually has engage so much am moved beyond being lackadaisical say scream contrast oh gee he cut stomach open kudos especially ellen burstyn who can out-act nearly everyone else on planet unforgettable as diet-pill desperate shot national tv
this movie goes to the extremes on all fronts . what a rad show !
this is a great film , not so much for the story content which has been done before and will be again but its presention . an all-out assault on senses.. visually audially emotionally ellen burstyn gives oscar caliber performance that you living her descent into addiction psychosis right along with one actress hollywood should start paying more attention to.. best work may still yet to come
the first time i watched this movie have to admit was quite disturbed . direction , script acting and music were done so well that emotional bang hits you in end is almost too much bear it as close ever been walking out of theatre because feeling gave me when starts spiral into darkness character's lives clench your fists together pray for some glint hope second watch requiem a dream notice how beautiful at beginning around its less disturbing all more depressing
i have no clue how to start . the movie is breath taking not only was there a superb case (including ellen burstyn , jennifer conelly jared leto and marlon wayans) but effect had on me amazing just finished reading novel immediately see reality of it makes you sick your stomach keeps from turning away wayans perfomed astoundingly well major turn his somewhat comical roles he normally assumes burstyn's performance brought tears would highly recommend this show any true fan
one of the best movies all time- great acting and music- lukas is at his best- i wish he made like this .
a wonderfull movie . george lucas' look at growing up in california the '60's must for any collection
if you haven't had your heart broken as a teen , wanted to fit in with the crowd own fast car or hesitate leave friends after graduate from high school couldn't identify this movie . i'm not anymore but i sure recall those great memories wonderful movie..
a classic , awesome movie filled with tons of old cars . keeps people's hearts beating and is entertaining
my favorite movie . it relates both to teens and adults (former teens)
really great movie . a classic the next time i have to come in here , i'm cracking skulls !
this is one great and scary movie . anthony hopkins perfect as hannibal lector jodie foster almost his equal the fbi agent there are some twists dialogue will keep you on edge of your seat right until end obvious bad guy , embodiment evil but find yourself mesmerized by him rooting for not slasher-type horror an incredibly suspenseful brilliantly written thriller
this is a great 80s movie . its really funny teen classic and it has soundtrack
this is one of the best movies ever , and definitely teen movie because it didn't show teenagers as drunk party animals dealt with real issues that teens go through but was still really funny .
oh my gosh think about it
this movie is definately in my top 5 greatest movies of all time . the whole cast was brilliant , and so believable you laugh cry just leave feeling like saw something worthwhile i would recommend coming age to everyone as always john hughes scores again  ! a wonderful director with much talent
this is really a good movie . i'm usually not that big on movies aren't funny , but entertaining glad tbs shows it all the time !
another 1980s classic . i must have seen it 1000 times , but just never get tired of had all the major high school categories ; brian geek andrew jock alison freak claire princess and john slacker showed how appearances could deceive that not everyone has bad course molly ringwald is perfect in her roll
this movie is a classic . and that's not just because it's john hughes' film it very well done , with great story acting timeless i think much better than many of the teenage films out today
i really loved this movie . almost every detail is perfect the cast , cinematography score costumes and of course script directing think julianne todd are one greatest teams in hollywood it's sad that far from heaven didn't get as much recognization it deserved however will always be my favorites
this movie is moving up my favorites list everytime i watch it . the cast terrific (although , how can you go wrong with julianne??) a wonderful film and definitely deserves more credit attention than has received
far from heaven uses superb craftmanship to make this film look and feel like a the 1950s . it plays powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before one detail is particularly true time : interracial love homosexual are treated as being on different moral planes contemporary movies take so many subjects for granted that they really at them director todd haynes , by stepping back in able bring these issues into focus cinematographer ed lachman faithfully reproduces lush studio style every shot has studied artiface of set decoration  musical score elmer bernstein with its underlining points punching-up emotions.i don't wish give synopsis movie's scenes except say packed power incredible acting images hit home i had find showing an art theatre made major marquees catch if you can! !
loved it . was soooo good and so sad julianne absolutely stunning ( as usual) a must see
a great contemporary film . well-written , acted and directed
my god . i don't think have ever been so horrified by a film one of the few times felt badly to be an american-the depiction us standing idly while this horror happened unnerved me
had don cheadle and sophie okenedo been nominated for many prestigious awards would this movie have viewed raised awareness about whats going on not just in rwanda , but sierra leone ethiopia uganda ? i don't think so . the bbc was only channel world that covered what to me thats simply enough theres more value human life than people its a pity an independent is showing
i am not a real big fan of people taking history lessons from hollywood , however think this movie is one the best mediums to teach young westeners that holocaust wasn't only 20th century . canadian youth learn about massacre briefly too actually because involvement in peacekeeping there don't know how much americans are taught on subject and source get point across lot saw it won't win oscar for picture but wish would pretigue recognition so more will go see haven't seen any other movies up award (don't really what award) can honestly say have while few mind paying 10+ bucks theater thing found wrong was nick nolte ambush scene felt action-hero like
chilling . some time ago i did freelance journalist work interviewing refugees of the massacres period heard stories wish could scrub from my mind , and have twice interviewed serial killers movie was incredible although a little grim
the blood was meant to be overboard and comical . q , as annoying a person he is genius when it comes making movies
this is a movie you catch for the history lesson , much more than entertainment value . there's plenty to admire in though it's heavy subject matter i'm glad i went last weekend and felt ashamed didn't know about million people systematically slaughtered during mid-nineties rwanda's holocaust of sorts why makes sense un its supporting countries intervene major international crisis which happened too little late rwanda easy relate family that centers around seeing all modern day conveniences most every scene do defeat myths have lifestyles africa big props heroic real-life hotel manager who excellently portrayed by don cheadle film
predictably when you consider the subject matter , hotel rwanda is not a particularly uplifting movie . but it an excellent one without giving anything away true story of hutu manager four star in kigali who converted at which he worked into refugee camp for hutus and tutsis during 1994 massacre (mostly by machete) that slaughtered about 1m civilians it's extremely educational film - example i didn't know tutu designation had been arbitrarily assigned belgian colonialists based on completely subjective physical attributes (e.g you're pretty tall shall be tutsi) does really good job showing civilized modern city took place was between two bloodthirsty tribes desert somewhere most all illustrates with chilling powerful simplicity what can happen out control partisanship combined hate radio animosity my wife cried much entirely through this parts are hard to handle worth seeing if nothing else education see brilliant performance don cheadle
this has been one of my favorite movies since it came out . it's great...this movie all ; love , greed violence the characters in make great as well actors that portray them sharon stone's performance is best i've ever seen by a female actor you also have to time setting '70s and '80s clothing cars houses every moment was entertaining truly cared about what happened
not in the top 10 ? are you people crazy what a film ! excellent
one of the greatest movies ever . this shows life history a great man very well presented with acting and characters
not as good pulp fiction but thats an unfair compaison . kill bill has amazing story line and many original parts(anime the black white fighting scenes) i understand that blood seemed fake missing point of movie for those who love guts , highly recommened
breathtaking . shows how one person , just can make a difference in life and the world truly beautiful piece that ease pain of anybody's passion for violence
quite intense emotionally as well the individuals strength of character .
an excellent film . this is not just a movie , but that should be rated among the classics of all time it fine example films on grand scale such as cecil b demille what more important subject gandhi was amazing man three hour only touches surface you will transformed by grace and dignity wonder why world has created gandhi's
incredible !
saw ghandi years ago and cried through the whole thing . very moving , compassionate yet mixed with life's danger
this is a movie about the man who held indian ideals in him real sense.the values for respect life,freedom time of colonial subjugation made great.but height his greatness was when reporter asked him...(sarcastically) mr gandhi how come you never won nobel peace prize even after being advocate nearly all your life??..he said i don't care because am not aiming it...my aim to help common india...when india passing through it's darkest days non-violence and peaceful methods
the most important film ever made of person in modern history ! mahatma gandhi is closest i , as a humanist come god :o)
qt does it again !
i have two favorite sports movies that stand out from the rest...remember titans and hoosiers . both coaches came into hostile territory proved how they could help shape lives of high schoolers school can make or break young people but these in helped responsible adults their athletes what made even better was dennis hoppers performance hackman's character not only men boys , inspired a man to be too !
along with remember the titans  , this has got to be best sports movie of all time . gene hackman as always gave a great performance did dennis hopper drunk basketball fanatic who badly wants get his life together but can't seem mind off bottle its so surprising me that emotional story is actually true- very rare espescially today find anyone dedicated their job hackman's character and team was
hoosiers will remain the greatest sports movie of all time . if you have only seen it on tv , must rent a copy and see almost always cuts out great dialog scenes that are classics alone what doesn't tell is this small town team also had to win two games in semistate round an afternoon game finals means they won day three consecutive weekends after their sectional state not mention (the milan indians) went final four year before (1953) total enrollment 161 1954 while at video store get breaking away it's another underdog story academy award for
the only movie involving sports that ever interested me because it was so much more than . a wonderful tale of underdog all way around on an off basketball court gene hackman does his usual stellar job acting and giving us very memorable character barbara hershey also believable as love interest but best performance dennis hopper cast pathetic , washed up alcoholic father one players absolutely excellent - i ve seen from story music era are definitely compelling misted start since personal level really reminded my in great part due to fact they filmed championship game at hinkle field house butler university campus (indianapolis indiana) where attended college early 1950 s course when call went out for extras cousins naturally answered oh yes m hoosiers even though you couldn t find with microscope ! lol
hoosiers is a terrific basketball movie . gene hackman stars as new high school coach with mysterious past , and his approach to coaching raises the eyebrows of players townspeople alike hackman's character forges ahead eventually takes team indiana state finals build-up was very effective i found myself totally involved in outcome after living small town for two years can attest fact that people really are obsessed ! if you're looking an absorbing feel-good try renting you won't be disappointed
an old high school movie that is still great . my family from ind , and it's a perfect representation
great freaking movie ! timeless tale of the underdog , all you have to do is tell it again and in different situations with acting (or maybe even so acting) you've got a hit . just look at versions this story chariots fire rudy rocky raging bull on list could go such stretches as it's wondeful life (he's an underdog) make film fella whose never gotten fair break who scrapes his way top win yourself winner course didn't hurt that had some best actors our time like gene hackman dennis hopper let's not forget lovely barbara hershey
hoosiers is one of the best sports movies all time . based on a true story , it shows what can be accomplished if you work hard and believe in yourself those around weren't would almost think too unbelievable yet that makes so special actor who plays star player jimmy chitwood great through very few words he portrays embodiment hopes indiana basketball gene hackman dennis hopper are perfectly cast as well you're looking to get pumped up before big game night out or an important meeting interview perfect choice
an important movie . wrestlers have vision quest , boxers rocky nascar drivers that bad tom cruise (days of thunder????) - clearly it's high school basketball teams inspirational to get them fired up for big game and this does the trick gene hackman a great job as coach hickory huskers dennis hopper nice drunk but knowledgable junkie one those movies almost impossible not like
well acted and a great story . made me very nostalgic for the early '70's just before music business became too corporate phillip seymour hoffman was absolutely brilliant
i have probably seen this movie easily 50 times as would consider it my favorite of all time . agree with an earlier comment that does leave you a rather empty feeling , has bittersweet ending but think title like almost famous didn't view the expecting to see feel-good year thought was real and very deep look at human nature emotions is not just about what life for rock stars in 70's people any period kate hudson amazing she perfect actress rest cast absolutly well there enough humour executed perfectly make fairly light hearted without taking away from drama soundtrack fantastic paused through credits wrote down every song they are actual should been 4 disks 1 doesn't do justice
one of my favorite films , this is based on the life director cameron crowe during his days as a teenaged journalist for rolling stone . patrick fugit plays main character with fresh-faced youth and vulnerability journey to adulthood he travels rock band compelling wildly entertaining kate hudson groupie heart charmingly rest cast terrific huge plus film its wonderful soundtrack filled great classic i just can't stop raving about movie
really loved this movie , was very well made and billy crudup for a great depiction of 70's guitarist .
one of the best coming age films i've ever seen . i was highly impressed , and this film makes my a list unfortunatly unable to see until after it came cable however does not require big screen come through is beautifully set extremely funny somewhat autobiographical circumstances characters as well their depth allow that if you enjoy 70's period pieces or even just like good comedy recommend flick
patrick fugit was soo real . you could not help but like him mr made this movie for me.i look forward to seeing in his next film
his mother was me ! i loved the innocence of that time . beautifully done kate hudson essence era
i love this movie it was everything ever wanted out of a , had comedy,romance,drama and light sence to that made you want be in . kate hudson though never could act but her smile inocence me think wow loved everyone on even if yo werent supose just so amazing
i really got into 'almost fanous' . this movie took me back.. ! tells it like is in the music scene even today was there hollywood during jim morrison and doors episode my point as well person when grace slick jefferson airplane performed their first public performance at long shoreman's hall s.f (the greatful dead appeared on same night , later) an enjoyable flick..
really good movie.. . i am not gonna say anything but you gotta see it if are into lots of music
this movie is so endearingly honest that you can tell cameron crowe truly trying to get it all out and really express himself . i could feel the amount of emotion he put into , including his love rock roll classics has an understated tone which probably what liked most about
i really just loved this movie . think it explains a lot ! also luv kate hudson and she is an excellent actress only more room to get better
best movie ever , really . it makes you actually feel good showcases a bunch of actors (except for frances mcdormand) that didn't think had such great performances in them but they truly do kate hudson is guaranteed oscar winner her face graces the cover and steals every scene priceless
great plot acting characters music ending . i truly enjoyed this movie , and think could see it again find equally entertaining.. the is well developed many-layered actors do wonders with even if that weren't case would be worth seeing just for soundtrack 5 stars
i was really impressed by this movie . the story line great with a lot of emotion
almost famous is the best movie i have seen in last six months . this strong every element casting was amazing film gives a great view of 70s rock and roll scene through eyes young writer found script very unmanipulated , never felt as though hit over head with any point or emotion myself tears at one not sure why believe it sincerity story telling that moved me to most memorable moments were words all but instead visual images contained much power would recomend anyone who can appriate good cast heartfelt experience
better than vol . 2 (which , by the way was outstanding) kill bill : volume 1 has following superlatives -- 1) best martial arts flick ever ; 2) homage to 1970s more obscure references [to that decade] a 5-hour dennis miller rant 3) musical soundtrack 4) girlpower (my my how uma evolved since playing helpless femme in dangerous liaisons) 5) while i think tarantino is an outright jackass ( particularly giving fathead turncoat moore palm d'or) you must marvel at his masterful directorial skills and cinematography 6) most violent film saw (though of bloodshed roadrunner vs wile e coyote variety)
this movie was awesome ! the very well-directed , actors did a great job even though i expected little less from some of new-comers and writing . patrick fugit portraying naive caring boy who learns life lesson not to mention that he has lot talent will be big star gets two my thumbs up
i was really impressed with 'almost famous' . it had a lot of starting out actors but they were all fantastic the story is about high school guy who good writer he gets job rolling stone (rs has no idea so young) to write an up and coming band goes on tour them along way that sad , funny exciting adventerous romantic develops this movie one thing look for in whether horror comedy or action adventure if get attacthed characters did into many different messages intertwined music amazing led zeppelin date have just heard some breaking news weekend come back share makes me like ten times more now based upon directors life used magazine follow bands around when teenager there penny lane changed my rating give 5 start
not many actors could pull off being on screen for a major potion of movie alone , and make it interesting belieavable but tom hanks pulls wonderfully . one the great acting challenges our time lives up to expectations he gives an oscar-worthy performance propably would have won had already captured two other awards earlier in his career co-star wilson really stole show became star everybody loves helen hunt did her best what essentially was throw-away role that poorly written photo locket real preformance here still castaway remains ijr's favorite flicks ijr says check out! !
excellent film . no cheese in this jodi foster played a convincing investigator the suspense was maintained throughout , especially garage scene you never knew what horrible lector going to say or do i like last line i'm having friend for dinner
both volume 1 and 2 are great !
the only reason people say they don't like this movie is beacuse it's either boring or stupid because he talks to a volleyball . those obviously can't sit for couple of hours and witness an excellent tom hanks gives another huge performance much film contains no dialogue , but still delivers powerful memorable experience
most movies tom hanks is in are great . this was outstanding possibly not so much for his acting , per se but the reality of movie it pretty showed what would happen if someone stranded on a deserted island gilligan's wasn't i enjoyed and realism portrayed can also see how even volley ball could become one's best friend such situation (i'll bet wilson company paid lot that one eh ? quite as fed ex did though)
tarantino takes all the best from martial arts genre and packs it into one great , tongue-in-cheek classic .
an exceptional movie . after all of the lukewarm comments on this page , i didn't have very high expectations for film what cast away delivered was a phenomenal performance by tom hanks couple chilling action scenes and un-hollywood ending storyline man stripped everything but his survival instincts pitted against awesome unpredictable power nature is powerful one if you haven't gotten around to seeing because hype / mixed press it received should wait no longer - real winner
cast away was an excellent movie , although some of the scenes with waves didn't look that great i thought tom hanks did part in this .
it's a great movie !
great movie ! tom hanks did a fantastic job wilson was cool--- though silent . the plane crash awesome island part good touch it showed harshness that can be encountered by man has very little survival skills i liked ending crossroads idea of 4 choices , believe would have followed pick-up truck this is definitely 'must see'
suffer..suffer... ! god it got to the point where i was literally squirming in my seat... enough is enough... showed much intelligence a city boy turned primal man on deserted island however . tom hanks surprized me this bunch... didn't even begin think dude like he could handle relationship had going so good movie and tho required tremendous strength tom's part do as did towards end....that really pissed off see her she ended up doing put after all he'd been through ending bozzled me......a bunch
this film definetly made me cry . it's effort and thought really payed off ! however , it did have a similarity to the story hatchet that i've seen read but leads you big surprize i just wish they didn't leave ya hanging at end
awesome plot ! a movie that grows on you . wanna know what happens next i would reccommend this to just about anyone
i put seeing this movie off for a while because of its length , finally saw it past weekend . certainly falls in the category different  other than plane crash doesn t really have any true action or suspense but some strange reason couldn pull myself away from wondering what was going to happen next now you might say well that s and wasn there been lot films out tried tap human suffering condition cast didn just tapped main line feed core tom hanks brilliant how many actors can take up over half solo never loose an audience ? not see questioning ending at first little miffed seemingly clich who knows decision will be made however more thought about else could end anything would considered predictable too convenient wrapped pretty bow fit rather nicely within whole theme life sucks awful bad
this was an interesting movie and it had some funny parts in which is awesome . i like most all of tom hank's movies
i thought cast away was a good movie . tom hanks as man who worked for fedex his plane crashes and he ends up on tiny deserted island has to find way survive the next four years opens one of boxes that washed shore finds volley ball decorates calls it wilson.the only thing talk hope getting rescued get back girlfriend this drama , humor sadness main character.i do not want give too much is little long we found be
this is one of my favorite movies all time...its just the feeling i had while watching it
i loved and also that at the end it showed what would happend in real life .so is great .
if you are looking for a feel good movie with happy ending , this isn't the to go watch . it is more of one man performance and hanks simply brilliant as always he has become that we love have sit next us hear him speak while i would loved see little inbetween time was on edge my seat crash scene reached such high level in acting ability reaching point where will be disappointed anything 5 star
well , let's just say i was surprised . hanks and zemekis a great film
i can understand if people didnt like it because was slow,but think a really good looking movie .
i thought the movie was wonderful . it didnt really leave me hanging as everyone said would certain signs that he had while on island made him realize his paths , and same when returned to civilization wasnt confusing figure out went back know fall in love with women at cross roads alot about life general so worried time rushing forget what important people nothing but laugh cry of any robert zameckis tom hanks are involved give two thumbs up!!!! !
if you appreciate what we have and don't take things for granted , this movie will open your eyes . just keep an mind it is a great
oh my ! i couldn't wait to see this movie and was not dissappointed tom hanks' character goes through so much you feel it all with him the crash scene spectacular ( iwas holding breath) , watching survive in island amazing (you his lonliness yet will survuve) then try readjust back into a society after being alone for long heart-wrenching (post truamatic stress syndrome...) . would again helen hunt also does great job best have ever seen such little dialog go
i loved the movie ! it included so many different kinds of feelings . sometimes you cry , other times laugh grip on edge your chair smile thought ending fit reflected what noland told his friend after he lost kelly all over again sun will come up in morning and never know tide might wash
it puzzle me to think how people could have not liked this movie . was so well planned out and directed that is clearly oscar wworthy also mention tom hanks perhaps did one of his best works ever point i disagree with the beach scene dragged too long because audience needed see exactly what like be stranded on an island , fending for yourself
little known fact , but the sequel is about further adventures of wilson . apparently after he floats off into sunset he's picked up by a kung-fu/volleyball master (played michelle yeoh) who's immigrating to america boat yeoh catches bad guys spiking at them
great movie ! there's a lot more to this than meets the eye if you're looking for an adventure , you'll be disappointed . you hate movies that have 'open' ending will it i think ratings showm at website reflect is about life itself and choices we've made make many criticized end of tom hanks has some new does not indicate exactly what he way had because there certain amount logic each different could fascinates me love ask people which choice do their responses are varied always subject debate i'm touchy-feely kind guy ( got my degree in accounting things balance damn it!) but cast away really moved
i seen this movie 5 times and hope to see it again.the ending said all , as chuck was standing at the crossroads of his life . we must live with choices make good or bad.this true
cast away still has me thinking about what life would be like living on a deserted island for 4 years with practically nothing . tom hanks did spectacular job in this role the movie was very realistic both beginning , middle and end i know many people didn't thought it made even better cause lets face not everything good ending special effects were liked how dialog minimal as well musical score wonderful
very entertaining . its hard to not pay attention this movie i kinda have concern for anyone in a comma now if you seen it know what i'm talking about they went way far with the blood seems like even minor papercut would shoot fire hose but thats just my exageration action and fighting are preety badass
the scene where sophie makes her choice is pure cinamatic brillance !
great film
one of the most unforgettable and moving films last 3 decades . this performance by meryl streep is an unequalled masterpiece also great performances kevin kline peter macnichol story heartbreaking poignant magnificent !
this film has a great story and its brilliantly violent bloody . movie is one of the best in action movies (well all ones ive seen.) not for everyone..so those people rating twos....you suck
a flawless piece .
omg this is the most beautiful movie ever its so sad and julianne more meryl streep do amazing performances it one of those movies that makes you appreciate life
can i stretch the word excellent ? yes , . great performances screenplay ed harris is amazing
the opening scene to this film is fantastic - great combination of helicopter blades and air conditioning fan in room . was loosely based on book 'heart darkness' respect journey down river descending more into hell i wasn't too sure about french plantation sccene , but otherwise love martin sheen laurence fishburne marlon brando harrison ford are a very important must see
this is apocalypse now to me , having not seen the original version . personally i see nothing wrong with film it perfect in every way very surreal disturbing certainly one of best examples cinema at its finest
the best film of this genre , it set bar high for many films to follow life in inner-city . great acting by cuba gooding but even better laurence fishborne and ice-cube very moving
it was the movie that woke america up to what happening in places like south central and awareness there more than just a news article real people with hopes dreams not being able achieve them young men losing their lives over color . something should have been gotten kindergarten ice cube shows his capability of becoming well known actor he has come far since this cuba gooding jr done fair share good bad movies thought would do much better though
this is a very good movie cause it lets u know whats happening to young african americans . and i its fu*ked up brothers always kill each other black people need stick together
i am white , love african-american movies that are dramas including drugs violence and language . ice cube is by far my favorite actor he brilliant remember watching this movie whenever it came out in 1991.. was just 11 thinking --- wow!! ! now 24 11-06-04 understand alot better makes me feel sorry for people living south central one of the best all time book 2 thumbs up
this movie best describes the african american society where blacks were all segregated in one area and chaos drives many of them to violence . true film that shows how bad things
the movie was very cultural as itt showed an aspect of african american society . plot well directed
can you love a horror movie ? if see this will . anthony hopkins should still be winning awards for film i think saw him on the street today would little afraid ! each minute of builds suspense and even have to cover your eyes at more graphic parts , dialogue carry through without missing beat
i loved this movie . it was hella real the topic actors were very talented entertaining sad still watch to day !
ice cube does a good job portraying your typical gangster . great cast of actors laurence fishburne and cuba gooding jr do this movie has been said to be the pillar hip-hop movies it shows whole other side la
this movie gives people a real glimpse into the world of underpriviledged . it shows pressures put onto young black men and temptations they face also way life , when promising football guy gets shot
boyz is a classic . cuba gooding jr great and ice cube character surprisingly it captured the attitude of times location while still having sense humor about gangster society soundtrak good mix oldies new songs
this was a great movie about life in the ghetto and realness of black man hood . but what made stand out is how trey's father hard on him he only one to make it
an all time great ghetto movie . very exciting shows a realistic view from the life in streets will be watched by many forever it's everyone should have their collection
cuba gooding jr . and laurence fishburne are excellent in this movie is a portrait of ghetto culture very realistic i've seen it many times actually use some the lines conversation with boyz , you ain't 'posed to go college pull no bitches yo ass posed be learnin' somethin ice cube
i thought this movie sent a lot of good messages . it made you think and realize things like why there are liquor stores on every corner in black neighborhoods blacks killing was sad yet uplifting pretty realsitic too
this movie is hella tight . growing up in lower middle america you see everyday- not to extreme , but close enough i love seeing good people bad situations overcome for trey
one of the best gangsta movies all time . it shows life south central la and has excellent acting performances by cuba gooding jr
a great movie . i've lived in vallejo most of my life and some bad stuff goes down that takes many star athletes out the pros gangs , crimes or just jealousy
this was a great movie . it real and to the point happy ending not cheesey warming heart also debut for nia long cuba gooding jr
this movie was very moving . it expressed the true life of ghetto and how for others although i couldn't relate to myself , emotionally
this was a realistic movie about the hood ! i used to live in and it brought back memories .
best of its genre .
this was a great movie . it emotional and you felt for the characters storylines best movie!! !
boyz n the hood is a urban classic that'll never die !
i thought this movie was going to be a typical whodunit , but surprised me by having many layers . sean penn earned his best actor oscar with skillful portrayal of jimmy whose daughter is murdered more complex than he appears at the beginning and not just grieving dad penn's acting in convinced that marlon brando my generation tim robbins also deserving praise as psychologically scarred dave who still trying come grips childhood trauma portrays sensitive wounded gentle giant agree previous poster stated mystic river should have won picture director posesses an immediacy dopey fable like lord rings sadly lacks
now i have seen a lot of movies but this by far is my favorite love it . can not wait until go to the movie store next time because am buying on dvd if you havent here helpful hint see amazingly greatness clint eastwood at his best
simply amazing..best movie i saw last year by far..i thought the three main characters were so different and complex..was really good fun watching it..had its own nice pace..wasnt hurried at all..beautifully made..i especially liked kevin bacon..he put up a very strong performance..all together..controversies aside..sean penn deserved best actor..i thot clint eastwood shouldve won too..beautiful story. .
should've won best picture , and director .
one of the best films i saw last year . what liked about it is that there were no special effects or big budget hollywood studios sticking their ore in , just a movie making room for sheer entertainment throughout this story keeps you interested character's are real dialogue's convincing not to mention outstanding performances from children adults well told clint easwood truly extra-ordinary teller
i really did enjoy it , and can relate to which makes even better . fun performances knock-out dance scenes
i think this was a really great movie , one of my favorites have seen it so many times forgot how . the dancing is sooo good makes me wish could be ballet dancer myself and agree with circe guy who plays charlie very hott! ! :)
all my friends were talking about how great center stage was but i had never seen it . rented last night and watched 4 times already have to buy now because love so much sort of makes me wish that could dance like !
this is a real feel good movie that makes you want to stand up and dance around it has music acting wish could do what they . i think ballet elegant like how was made
it is only the best movie ever made . disscuses a lot of major issues todays world also presents characters that you can relate to and love
being a dancer , this movie inspired me to exell in my ballet . it also taught more about such as positions and the dancing was beautiful showed how hard you have work get there  i would recomend dancers of all types though must say acting wasnt wonderful ya know now that anorexia girl threw fit front her boyfriend...that pretty bad
there's only one word to describe it , inspirational ! even if you are not a dancer will watch the dancing with awe and just feel motivated in whatever want become life you're bound like . of greatest dance movies all time!
i'm a dancer of 9 years and i have never seen such excellent dancing in movie . loved it
i loved this movie....it has been put onto my fave list . if you like movies that have romance and dreams coming true is a movie to watch..the acting by the guy who played cooper wasn't great but other than was good plot amanda-jody awsome helped me see with hard work even can achieve dreams...i it
it was a great movie for anyone who would be able to enjoy with dance . shows how hard is dancer and that some things are worth working
i loved this film ; it makes you want to dance right in your seat .
me , being a dancer completely appreciated the movie . all those who said that was missing plot have to understand difficulties it is be even as little kid they pick out every detail about you show great in i personaly thought this excellent,and dancing awesome ! there's one part where eva working hard on her at night...and anyone who's can what thats like excellent totally reccomend any dancers there...not too much for guys though..
i loved the movie and watched it over . wasn't acting that enjoyed but dancing was great suggest you see if like
fantastic ! an energetic , colourful slice of martial arts mayhem with a great female lead wonderful fight scenes and absolutely spot-on music . the alone is woth seeing this film for as violence it's tarentino movie! you knew that before went to see it so why flick if morally object severing body parts ? seems slightly masochistic me watch violent you're squeamish
it might be cuz i love dancing , but this is a great movie all around and has good messages !
i thought this was such a good movie ! it made you want to get up and dance . very inspirational gave me confidence as dancer!!
man , i luved the movie . have watched it about 20 times i'm a dancer for 13 years i've never felt like dance this way until saw its an inspiration
an awesome movie that makes you feel great ! the dance scenes are bomb
i loved it!!!!!!1
i did not like pulp fiction . however , do love this movie and can't wait for part 2 great homage to kung fu movies with a definite injection of american style very violent definitely kids the is full symbolism obscure references that many people will get
i thought the movie was excellent . it portrayed young adults working hard to achieve their dreams this is highly recommended
it was one of the best movies i saaw this year..it up there with coyote ugly
this is one of those movies that makes you feel good . it want to dance , even if aren't a dancer the acting so-so but dancing incredible especially ballets at end top all off guys are hot (sascha radetsky = charlie)
i believe it was a great movie , that matthew guy is real babe .
this is the best movie ever done ! i loved it , and have seen if four times while in theater . thanks for such a great
i thought this movie was incredible . it may be because am a dancer but really great inspired me to dance better and work harder
i loved it ! if you danced ballet when were younger , will fall in love with this movie and want to go back .
it was very inspirational and nice to see another aspect of american culture being recognized . i had never realized how difficult be a dancer get position in dance company
this movie was a fantastic adaptation of edith wharton's novel . house mirth skillfully portrays young woman in late 19th century new york society who makes few dumb mistakes , and is harshly punished for them gillian anderson eric stoltz were marvelous the leading roles should have been at least nominated oscars but if you're looking that will make you feel good don't rent one break your heart
amazing movie , a must see experiance .
i do love tarintino's work and after watching this feel he has excelled himself . the direction in film is just simply beautiful doesn't been much meaningful spoken dialogue as action , movement reaction of characers enough for you to know what going on there an interesting mix animation which gels wonderfully fighting scenes are choreographered perfection well worth seeing am definately see second one
this movie is in my top 10 greatest movies of all time . i loved the drama had  ! ending made me feel great , too erin definately someone to look up world there are so few like her left anymore was also first by julia roberts that good never thought day would come
i have to admit did not like q.t . previous work but kill bill is awsome
okay , i admit i'm biased as a single mom of three kids who would like to think that someone me could do something so amazing . but really she was just working hard and stumbled upon even if were her few turn their back on liked this movie for some the more subtle scenes depict heartache mother must work keep food table best scene when in car coming from hinkley late at night heard about baby's first word julia roberts acted any other whose heart broken over missing such an important moment cried with tell person doesn't seem get what it is watch those took my advice come say they had no idea true juggling don't agree outspoken way behaving sometimes all be admired
erin brockovich is an adaptation of a real story . for those people who know about the case , it's pretty good believe it or not movie tamer than truth yes eb dresses like whore way julia roberts dressed in but 10 times more revealing and she's open has gutter mouth that's she talks when you're talking this don't forget marvelous job that albert finney did as crotchety ed masry unless predisposed to hate must see
one of the best horror/thriller movies 90s . anthony hopkins is perfect as hannibal cannibal lector , and jodie foster who usually annoys me does a great job inexperienced but determined agent starling this movie comes back to haunt occasionally because friend mine funny-but-also-upsetting imitation scene where guy says she puts lotion in bucket if you enjoyed silence lambs should also check out lesser-known called manhunter it was based on book (called red dragon ) written by thomas harris same wrote
best movie ever quentin out did himself
erin brockovich would definately be on my top ten list of great movies . i feel it deserves a much higher placement this rateitalllist because not only was riveting , interesting timely film circling an important issue based true story and landmark legal case ! if any you reading think really like so i'm big julia roberts fan again one the very few people who hated pretty woman actually didn't good in her many films except maybe sleeping with enemy - but amazed me she performed part flawlessly just seemed to belong spirit deserved academy award for
julia was great in this film and she deserves every award gets (and all those doesn't!) . the highest kudos !
great movie !
ooo mah god ! that movie was the best at first i didnt understand it , and like wanted to fall asleep but when sorda figured out all came together aww soo happy @ end cried . well cry in every so whatever
this is a great movie for both guys and girls . it's kind of long , but you don't notice because are so into the to see with big crowd everyone will be cheering her on
this movie was so good . the fact that it a true story made great
go ahead and give julia her academy award !! !
one of the greatest movies i have ever seen .julia kicks ass .
i just need to know if erin brockovich ever married george ? noticed that her name is now brockovich-ellis . but , it never tells us anywhere in the movie or credits what george's last
julia roberts was phenomenal in this movie , if she does't receive an award of some kind hollywood must be a coma .
excellent performances . good story
an overall enjoyable movie . the wise cracks were great but wardrobe was a bit over top i could really feel for victims in
not your typical julia roberts movie , but it's great ! see a different side to her and be prepared cheer on as always .
we need more post-feminist movies ! julia roberts made the movie perfect with her popularity . i definitely went to see it because of celebrity
a movie based on reality which depicts very good story with superb acting . well presented and documented
this movie was cool . i really felt for the victims of pg e's conspiracy and glad that erin able to expose them great story acted well julia is bomb !
had all the ingredients necessary for a great movie : strong plot , good dialogue romance intrigue and leading lady who was as exceptional an actress she beautiful . this is one of most well done david goliath stories i have seen in long time would strongly recommend to anyone regardless their prefs
steven soderbergh is jesus christ with a movie camera . it was commercial film that stayed true to the filmmaker's style julia roberts excellent , as supporting cast despite well known story done and extremely entertaining
amazing ! i loved it .
i enjoyed seeing female actors in strong roles . the movie was a good vehicle for julia roberts to strut her stuff
only a few words describe this wonderful , movie . women rule ! when i left felt like could do anything despite what people throw in my path
the movie turned out to be a lot better than i thought . it has of comedy with good story
i love julia roberts . it is a great story as well even her swearing didn't bother me was an interesting in comparison to prior films
good movie -- both my husband and i enjoyed it ! had to convince him go . he said was funnier than expected glad went
this movie is great! ! julia roberts gives her best performance . i agree she should be , at the least considered for an oscar nomination as dress code in i've heard from my friend that true erin said oprah actual dressing style even more revealing than robert's film so those of you who feel offended with sexy just know real dressed sexier what's up anyway ? seen women robert didn't see jennifer lopez?
this is a very fast-paced , interesting movie . while the subject matter may be somewhat serious it still ends up being feel-good in end story has few twists and exploration of protagonist's family life quite uncommon julia roberts fantastic as erin she should nominated for an academy award
it's a great movie about being working mom . the portrayal of this sharp tongued character who is quick to take offense , but still manages enlist people in her cause was incredibly effective i could have done with less bra straps showing all time
okay , so maybe the love triangle was a little contrived and annoying but overall this good movie . i thought jude law ed harris were especially in their respective roles story of russian sniper particularly interesting to me as terror insanity battle stalingrad if you ever get chance play part game call duty can see how modeled after -- everything from dangerous river crossing rationing ammo shooting those who turned back is there
historically accurate.. . and it even shows you that both sides were murderous sobs
outstanding setting and storyline . good performances by all those involved , lots of suspense action
imho so far it's the best movie i've seen in cinemas year 2001 . true that it hasn't been a great , but also this is good film storyline script wonderful acting (jude law and ed harris) score
this was an extrodaniry movie .
a classic movie that deserves better rating for it's great view of the difficulties slaves .
this film is well developed . the actors are very suited for their roles and play them courtroom scenes crafted , struggle justice briliantly portrayed movie boldly looks at some of most hated points american history displays greatest pieces ideology freeman hopkins excellent supporting but stars really bring out victory
a wonderful movie . it gives slightly different twist to history
the movie was a bit long , but very well put together . this showed history it fact based i would recommend to educators and other ethnic groups enjoyed reading subtitles from slaves
the most moving film i have ever seen . it changed way thought
amistad was a great movie because it proved that the law made out for all people , not judging among color .
talk about a great movie , this is the one . if you've never cried or laughed in then for you it gave me better understanding of how afro-americans were treated back whole new outlook
very powerful . a little too hyped up - i don't think it was quite one of those movies that has to be made(like schindler's list) , but great nonetheless
one of the most under-rated movie world has seen best spielberg-movie ! amazing acting :o)
a feel good film . :) so much better than the shipping news in my opinion
i loved this movie . recently rented it and was one of the best movies i've seen in a long time setting is wonderful takes place small french village absolutely beautiful ; made me wish there had great message to , differences characters enlightening
johnny depp is one of the best actor's in hollywood and this movie proves that . was so sweet loving i couldn't take my eyes off screen soo sexy wish could played juliette binoche part
this is a heart-warming , beautiful movie . i couldn't get over it after saw was so binoche molina dench depp the whole damn cast (including matrix's carrie-anne moss) are perfect felt like having some chocolate seeing other than fact it's french villiage and they all speak english with accents (what're gonna do?) recommended summary : hart-warming
i really enjoyed chocolat . the movie is about a woman ( vianne , played by juliette binoche) and her daughter who move to small provincial town in france open chocolate shop town's mayor not pleased with what he thinks she represents attempts sabotage story develops nicely several interesting sub-plots acting terrific i'm surprised least that binoche was nominated for best actress role this johnny depp judi dench are both great too although deals mostly relationships it moves at good pace never boring if you're looking nice without lot of violence or sleaze would be choice suggest arming yourself bar before entering theater..
sergio leonne's final , loving ode to the medium he adored is possibly his best . greatest poets can describe ineffable through words but leonne filmmaker indescribable without using one of first scenes where noodles (de niro) as an old man returns bar that was focal point so much storied life a perfect example this camera pans gradually and contemplatively over black white pictures looks agape lost in memories then slowly walks towards what appears be unremarkable closet or storage area film treats it if were hallowed ground entering gazes small opening wall sees elegant dancing girl used spy upon pubescent boy now looking mournfully into youth i watched felt deeply affected italian director had somehow communicated me like look back on lifetime profoundly moved barely even started yet ! movie documents friends young hoodlums prohibition-era america how they grew from boys men small-time thieves established gangsters intriguing duality raised because grow their capacity for crime too does sense loyalty love another course though (especially criminal) tested by ambition stray darker shades obsession disarmingly whimsical often has equal extremely grim disturbing it's truly biopic explores both very worst aspects humanity make sure catch full unedited 227 minute version long not second masterwork missable
the thing i like about sergio leone is that when watching his movies,and especially this one , you have feeling he holds nothing back in terms of reality.i mean man would be capable showing s**t movies,if it serves a artistic purpose.but not realistic la news,it also full poetry,feelings,imagery.this combo between gritty realism and feelings mastered uniquely by leone.as for actors...loved every performance.even very small roles were excellent.1 last word : wow !
one of the most amazing film i have ever seen in my life . this is quite simply breathtaking pity people don`t regard it same way they do godfather though
i can understand that some people would find the deliberate , methodical pace of this film as off-putting but think if you take it in context social and class relationships time glean a new understanding . to me is amazing amount restraint hopkins thompson bring their roles only be proper for those service at juxtaposition unattainable romance two downstairs against fading glory upstairs crowd genius especially interesting fact author who so manages capture essence english structure an expatriate japanese
up there with the exorcist , shining and all classic psychological thrillers
masterful acting by sir anthony . he must go down as one of the greats low key , but always interesting deep thoroughly entertaining movie
emma thompson and sir anthony hopkins are so marvelous in this movie ! until the end of , you go on hoping something happen .
ben kingsley probably the most evil bad guy ever in this role.. .
good british crime drama . weird link of sexuality and violence the acting is very understated , a lot going on under surface tension power struggles smart exciting film visually also sharp sense humor (ever so important) ;)
a daunting tale of drug-induced decadence and how the lead character renton few his friends effectively abandon crushing tedium their everyday poverty-stricken lives head into downward spiral addiction with some terrifying (and vividly portrayed) consequences . robert carlyle ewan mcgregor are both superb actors no less so in this film excellent soundtrack too , i listen to it all time includes iggy pop's lust for life underworld's classic born slippy (which if you long enough loud you'll feel like you're on drugs!)
great movie , but an even greater sound track .
'it's such a perfect day , i'm glad i spent it with you!' very darkly humoured look at heroin addiction in edinburgh . sharp wittly caustic and full on intelligent social commentary the film which propelled ewan mcgregor towards hollywood stardom robert carlyle gives his best performance i've seen to date as dysfunctional alcoholic begbie if you liked this try watching shallow grave not quite good but still has danny bolye's tar black sense of humour
a great dramatic film starring some british actors iv got the dvd and have watched iot loads of times never sick it . if you like this read junk by melvin burgess , portrays all difficulties being heroin addict as well pleasures can see donward spiral leading to total going into rehab similar trainspotting
i was amazed at how funny and disturbing this movie . it is one of the best movies have ever seen , for message sends those that believe glorifies drug use you are crazy showed to my kids in effort give them anti-drug (apart from requiem a dream) they will see yes drugs feel good we shouldn't shy away telling our or not trust what tell costs feelings worth all also america consider be impovershed standards quite high compared scotland ! hud housing would considered luxurious there
brillant .
i still can't believe over in america they had to have subtitles for this film . if you think that was a heavy scottish accent the , haven't heard my grandad ! even understand him right back issue very contraversial when it first released and seen as glamourising drug use never so much crap entire life obviously didn't watch its daunting can be humourous acted out well portrays depression of parts society up scotland which also reflected anywhere modern world outstanding
wow ! for a twisted movie this one is really , good . it covered many socio-topics and portrayed the cast almost magically by end of film i was exhausted having seen lives people grow or die bathroom scene swimming in toilet dream will forever be burned my mind
this movie really puts its finger on the pulse of drug scene . cinematography is awesome one best soundtracks to come out in years
i like this movie because it has a realistic plot with an optimistic ending . makes you look at the world in different way and eases your mindframe it's must see , even if is little bit graphic violent
it's pretty disgusting but very good . it showed the dark side wasn't too much , and like cheesy drug use movie a blend of everything
this movie is innovative and imaginative . it brings together an excellent story with a visionary artistic side it's entertaining well paced
a fun , yet insightful trip into world most of us will never encounter . though the lives these people seem so foreign moral and ethical questions they face are same we also see how friendships held together torn apart-need greed
irvin welsh is so crazy . he wrote trainspotting and other books has a lot of great short stories makes more sense the you watch it weird movie though
this movie is great ! i've seen it like a zillion times and never tire of . the acting good , little boy shorty adorable willie love interst was hysterically funny
i loved this movie . it was a fair and insightful look into the very complicated issue of death penalty
hilarious movie - extremely well done . my only complaint is that i sometimes had trouble understanding what they were saying (although it's probably own problem the same thing happened with full monty )
billy bob's best performance to date . he's hardly recognizable , and without a drop of make-up or latex an absolutley heart-wrenching story with some the quotable lines any movie i've ever seen
perhaps the greatest performance in cinema history . billy bob is transformed
a sad , yet wonderful movie . billy bob thornton never breaks character as mentally challenged but pure-hearted karl slingblade is serious in nature contains some laugh out loud moments well
you shouldn't have done the.. . he's just a boy
haunting movie , sad story........ .
the scariest of indiana jones movies . temple was real scary and heart plucking scene , though farfetched cool also mine rope bridge scenes were exciting
i'm much more of a baseball guy myself , and never thought that i would enjoy movie about football . but boy was wrong ! this had it all : action drama comedy great acting did job balancing out the typical disney atmosphere ( feel good type movies) with true hardships both races to face when integration implemented in 50s 60s 70s very touching film acceptance understanding tolerance topped off some music one hell cast
denzel wasington was excellent in this as always . great story about race the south especially through eyes of youth entertaining , and nice that it didnt make football scenes appear unrealistic like many sports movies
it wasn't the best done movie of 2000 (it was well done) , but it's real . i admit fall for true feel good stories take two segregated schools white school has a great football team and storied coach black isn't quite there merge them school's (denzel washington) make him head new winner nobody will believe ? life touching see !
finally a movie with heart ! decent . this is one of the best modern day movies made good directing , excellent writing outstanding acting and production
this movie is both inspirational and proves to be another one of denzel washington's great performances . based on the true story an african-american who becomes a football coach evokes emotion see through colour in his overrun white team it filmed beautifully along with highly emotional scenes , also has few funny moments (e.g learning black dislikes likes pairs) dvd features explaining meanings certain orray deleted truely told teaches us look beyond into brave wise words herman boone
an all time great movie - classic to buy on tape/dvd and watch again .
funny and moving . the only problem i saw was that there were far too many climactic moments in which they played overly dramatic music some important decision is made , etc most movies lead up to one of these however think remember titans had about six didn't annoy me enough inspire subtract a star denzel washington excellent thought plus good soundtrack !
a great movie,one of the best i've seen this year
one of my favorite movies this year . relaxed and witty most the time but it turned out to be a real tearjerker if you like original come see movie
this movie was awsume ! it had a great theme about how even people with different races can get along . denzel in as he alwayz is definetly must see
excellent movie . everyone in america should see it spoke of the power created from a united effort , as one  and enjoying making best differences people- not discounting them just because color religion etc also showed how people can change even most die-hard rednecks all colors get beyond their prejudices once they actually to know person was powerful full hope ! i think be shown at highschools churches well theatres
good movie , i could watch it with my family and freinds . something new now days
this is my favorite movie ever ! it awesome . denzel washington very good in so ryan gosling it's funny some parts too
i was epecting a good movie . this one passed my epectations easily , the acting superb as denzel always is plot well written when over wished there more
what a great movie ! i thought sissy spacek and hugh wilkinson should have gotten best actress actor oscars respectively , but of course the people like never win . does particlularly understated masterful job as spacek's husband film buffs might be interested to know that this amazing actually hails from yorkshire england was in hugely funny full monty he's anything heart-wrenching drama about family is devastated by son's affair with an older woman catastrophic results deserves kudos normally strong mother who simply cannot deal death her son makes some sharp comments america's justice system too their murderer gets off lightly has endure agony running into him at local grocery store can only manage feeble hi wilkinson's solution dilemma shocking unconventional one certainly understand it however will definitely not leave you smiling ear rent if you're depressed mood for good cry
great acting by everyone in the cast made this highly believable and understandable .
this is a great one . especially when that guy takes the heart out of sacrificed individual
in the bedroom is one of most powerful films year ! tom wilkinson and sissy spacek are superb merisa tomei excellent rest cast sublime storyline a bit predictable , yetthat not point film ; this movie shows how act violence can tear family to shreds . very quiet disturbing i litteraly mean there many scenes that show character doing something with no speech scene where sitting on couch smoking ciggarett staring at tv screen look shock its all an a+ note : realistic making it much freaky sad
great fim espacilly liked the dance seen in hall
i really enjoyed this movie . mostly the well fleshed out characterizations for instance , even when you hated father being so abusive to billy or brother angry once have a chance know their situation still manage sympathy them and though is portrayed as likeable kid they didn t try make him perfect angel either which did nothing turn against had everything do with making believable cast was terrific from poor old grandma s friend down street only thing in that not seem ring completely true became star of ballet regardless fact most dancers begin at around age 3 but start taking lessons until he nearly his teens guess whole point prodigal who beat odds - more ways than one
re-educating people about gender bias . great setting , message !
this film has a lot of heart . it's great feeling to cheer for billy elliot as he fights his passion in dance and need express it jamie bell gives fantastic performance : touching , sensitive defiant i loved was very moved by the end music with lots tracks t-rex is also superb a+ !
not noramlly my style but i loved it !
this may be the best movie of year . no kidding....no exageration reality and social butality strikes in northern england were brought home with first rate acting writing that was right on a moving totally believable story outstanding performances by actors i had never heard before....see it
terrific movie . plot and action were powerful
my favorite movie ever!! ! mel gibson gives an outstanding performance as benjamin martin , a father of seven children who keeps family top priority in his life . he is from south carolina state which going to war with the british doesn't want ; wishes there were some alternative it however ends up fighting along oldest son gabriel take revenge for death thomas one benjamin's sons references are made slaves i liked way those conflicts resolved end colonel tavington got what deserved end.. really that restoration order taking place was great when house being rebuilt overall awesome adventure and journey dealing american history packed storylines action suspence rush out see
this movie really depicts the devotion our ancestors portrayed while fighting battle of freedom . no obstacles were able to stop them it truly exemplifies what a real patriot is
powerful movie.. . not to mention the kids bearing guns part pissed hell outta left
its my favorite movie in opinion one of the best made ! :) oh , heath mel are just wonderful but soooo sad what happens .
in my opinion , an excellent movie . a great story very moving emotional jason isaacs made the as it was for me other characters were good too maybe not historically perfect but still think about this country and how we became free i simply loved
mel gibson was great as always . i really didn't find much wrong with the movie actually , couldn't see anything any mishaps or mistakes so if is near perfect it deserves a five ! heath ledger surprisingly good had only seen one by him..
very gorey and hard to take . but a good story family is priority in this film
this movie was deep . a lot of spiritual insight it's all about standing up for and preserving principles
this movie covered war , family and history all things i am interested in .
best movie i ever saw . everone should see it
i think that the patroit was one of best movies ever saw ! heath ledger looked so good in it . guess mel did too but don't really know muck about him
great movie
the bottom line is this , if you are a fan of braveheart i am confident will enjoy movie . looking to learn something about revolutionary war take history class at your local university patriot not documentary nor was it advertised as such !
what a great concept ! hot guys , history and darn good plot
since braveheart this the most powerful movie i've seen in a long time . i almost believed that actors were real people back during revolutionary war they did fantastic job , esp mel gibson and heath ledger anyone who talked to have said was cried even though i'm canadian is imprinted my mind believe it's closest will come understanding definitly be best of year
reading everyones comments about the patriot . i feel some was right and wrong movie all could say , it has spoken well to show us what really happen durring war that character col travington only doing his duty also showing true feelings thought this very emotional sure british soldier burning church with innocent folks but who higher in rank stop him from so gerneral's fault allow do he good at a evil valiant  is jason isaacs perform hope got paid for work
every citizen of this once great country should be required to watch the patriot . movie brilliantly demonstrates why we have 2nd amendment in bill rights our constitution too many people sacrificed everything make available freedoms enjoy today forces at work take them away from us must stopped their tracks as far historical accuracy , read about battle cowpens you will find that historic was a much more one sided victory for continentals than suggests !
i thought that the patriot was one of best movies ive ever seen . it had all essentials to being a great movie , too tried find out on vhs but can never only dvd well rented and watched so many times know every word mel gibson is going say really like fighting scenes also
mel gibson strikes again in another great movie . a must see
this movie is great ! i've seen it like a zillion times and never tire of . the acting good , little boy shorty adorable willie love interst was hysterically funny
and just what are some of you basing your opinions this movie being historically incorrect ? were all there during the events importance lies not in 100% accuracy , but real story a young nations' fight for independence . it shows heart soul men women who sacrificed everything so could live free today with crap generated hollywood nothing more than eye candy was nice to be treated an interactive experience where said as important done any american sense pride their country will able watch proud heritage
the patriot is best movie i have ever seen . there was so much action it had different genres of movies all in one drama , and comedy this deserves a five star rating!i loved sooooo can't wait to buy !
i think that the patriot is one of greatest all-times movie!it was excellent!the acting great(both from mel gibson and heath ledger) ! historical accuracy might not be at its best but it does really matter.the movie reflect a bit single-handedly saved world theme so many american movies have about them,but still very good . if could would given six stars
mel gibson , what can i say ? it is definitely one of the best summer movies with a great plot acting and smooth transitions between scenes . only complaint had about this movie that too much like braveheart
best movie i have ever seen . absolutly love it !
this movie was great--a perfect balance between gory violence and healthy patriotism . restraint an interesting idea for a theme i'm glad mel didn't have any most importantly , though how neither fraud nor sham definite plus
our local radio talk show host (chuck baldwin live pensacola , florida) bought out 2 theatres showing the patriot and offered free admission to his listening audience as a thank you for 6 years on air . over 350 people of all ages watched loved it ! i would rank good gone with wind epic really appreciated movie that was able take my kids taught them some history patriotic principles there were very violent scenes but think needed be told children horrors war price freedom
you can tell mel gibson has children in real life..he was very moving this film-we are lucky to have him as an actor our generation . who the boy that played older son ? a star watch , i believe
this movie was i think the best that mel gibson has ever played a role in . he fantastic made me look at our country's history of war different prospective although it may have been , realize how for men fighting freedom really brought tears to my eyes and celebrated 4th july whole light year !
i enjoyed watching the patriot . didn't think mel gibson could be as successful with he was braveheart but wrong they are both equally good movies
patriot is a fantastic movie . great story , costumes lot of action the not too realistic which rare these days
i watched x-men before watching patriot . think edges out was highly accurate , and surprised that it turned better than had hoped ! will see again almost cried when saw benjamen martin carrying the flag
what a great movie!! ! i give it 5 stars without doubt . if could , even wanna more than love the movie itself actors (chemistry between veteran mel gibson and new-comer heath ledger's are sooooo good) soundtrack i've seen three times can't wait till comes on vhs or dvd
i didn't really know what to expect going in , and the three hour running time made me a bit weary but definitely thought it was worth . story line extremely interesting enjoyed historical aspect of acting also very good would want see future movies starring these actors
i thought this movie was wonderful . think people need to remember that it is just a , not required be completely accurate everyone has their interpretation of history anyway i've never read so many pious comments have degree and know enough say there bit truth in both sides maybe every british general wasn't brutal but some were after all we are americans allowed portray the bad guy on whichever side choose please lighten up mel gibson gave us another with substance when we're surrounded by these beyond stupid teeny bopper movies thank him
the patriot is excellent ! god bless america . we need to be more patriotic and grateful for people who helped found our country
mel gibson still has it . he is inspirational , moving and emotional all at the same time
anonymous (the fraud one) must be a british subject . while this movie is compilation of multiple stories from the revolution , it has good historical base very heart ripping that should motivate any american to proud our forefathers as devout constitutionalist i found scenes regarding militia and firearms ownership use exceptional see
i really liked this movie . in a time when our idea of war is the video game-type air raid on iraq broadcast live cnn , it was amazing to see face musket battles displaying his action prowess and tremendous acting ability mel gibson great while there were parts that cheesy hokey raw emotion characters made easy for me overlook those also even though happy ending (i'm not giving anything away here...if you don't know u.s won revolutionary have no business using computer) moments true loss which inevitable times highly recommend film be sure check out theaters
like all the other indiana jones movies , this one was great . it's fun scary and has a lot of action suspense although those are is my favorite for dining scene loads bugs
it shows the american independence which was very informative and depicted . has a good screenplay roles played were superb , effort shown in presenting struggle outstanding
a very good movie . the scenic views make film appealing and pretty acting casting of characters is top notch it depicts scenes war with brutality , makes viewer feel more in touch history american revolution
best movie i have seen since titanic . should be required for all young people to get a brief understanding of the sacrifices made by who founded this country applaud mel gibson making film with such strong conservative values
wonderful film filled with thoughtful quality performances . very depressing weren't the people who played hillary swank's family members completely convincing as poor white trailer trash ?
i finally got around to seeing this movie , and man it's tough watch . the whole time you know where is headed but still can't prepare yourself for emotional wallop when it happens hilary swank one of best actors out there - she plays trailer park girl perfectly clint eastwood at his understated morgan freeman exactly same role he did in shawshank redemption again works him think story what makes work inspiration followed by devastation would be curious as foes euthanasia have say about
i really enjoyed watching the movie because thought it was funny and action-packed . liked characters in , especially little boy shorty
heart breaking . the mother daughter dynamic was tough to swallow perfectly acted by main cast and told in an unrushed sincere manner befitting story
if you don't know it we are at school , then how can rate ? idiot this was a solid movie with good story .
richly deserving its accolades . i would venture to say clint deserved the best actor oscar , but he did get director though it looks like a boxing movie is so much more than that you need see i'd put in my all-time top-10 and probably picture since forest gump
a wonderful film . jamie foxx showed me more of that special something i saw in (don't laugh) any given sunday literally becomes charles for this film-taking on the mannerisms , carriage and voice ray movie genius as well tragedy very human talent was particularly moved by portrayal his mother woman who you would expect to resent her son(s) (1 raising two young boys menial labor 2 stunned child stood younger brother drowned 3 blind heavier burden within year brother's death) instead never lays blame at ray's feet loves him strong brave way sacrifices sending last she has away (this must have broken heart) attend school where he might learn enough become someone movie's epiphany is (in dream/fantasy sequence) tells all success failed promise becoming an addict message about motherhood
jamie foxx is terrific as ray charles . i really did forget he was an actor portraying very well done movie it took life until the mid 60s liked that honest and showed his talent along with flaws entertaining movie.and we get to hear some of music
eating the fried monkey brains , eyeball soup hallway with bugs and beating heart . these scences are all time bests of temple doom it was really good i can watch over
a great documentary . the length of movie was appropriate
absolutly amazing .
jamie foxx's finest hour . he deserves an oscar nomination and
i read a review of this movie that said you forget you're watching someone play ray charles , and it couldn't be more true . jamie foxx was incredible probably find interesting life to make about
awesome performance by jaime foxx . worthy movie to the legacy of ray charles
very good movie . leo and tom did a job acting together realistically done , an amazing story
this movie kept me interested the entire time . it was mind boggling how a guy can evade police for so long and take on many identities i thought deserved five stars because intrigued not movies do that dicapprio wasn't bad either ; he's always been hottie
loved it !
my favorite movie of the year . it was a bit long , but i really liked it's kind you want to buy on video or dvd just got mine ! watch this ; won't regret
catch me if you can was a very cool story . i thought it enjoyable with well developed characters
i just loved this movie . went in expecting to see an ok , but it is really entertaining ! dicaprio perfect for the part of frank abignale,the con man as tom hanks his role fbi agent a great
i watched this movie again and really fell in love with the character daisy randone . she is just a giant intriguing mystery she's well done who's finally found out her death scene made me cry so hard brittany murphy deserved an oscar nomination for role
this was an outstanding movie ! angelina jolie's performance indescribable a true story about 18 year old girl , susanna kaysen (played by winona ryder) who accused of being insane and put into mental institute . she meets many girls with problems far worse than hers for example lisa (angelina jolie) there is no better one i can say that honest truth if you've read the book might ruin some assumptions you made during your reading or clear up fuzzy areas it's my favorite ever
i love this movie . everything about it is amazing , the acting plot characters angelina jolie and winona ryder are such actresses so real it's just perfect a thousand times better than one flew over cuckoo's nest
without a doubt five star movie based on four-star graphic-novel . yes , that's big thick comic book brandon lee had just reached stardom after the rapid fire and then was taken from us during filming of crow at least he left his mark with it great move killer soundtrack
it was movie that made you think about how much society hasn't changed and labels are still put on people . also system takes control tells have to change be acceptable i haven't read the book yet but awesome loved
i love this movie ! it's one of my favorites . a very haunting and disturbing film in some ways , but overall it is an excellent human drama the performances are awesome- think includes winona ryder's best work course angelina jolie was simply amazing disturbingly natural as sociopath lisa story has timeless quality- could've easily taken place today because world just crazy screwed up back late 1960s supporting actors were great too from whoopi goldberg to brittney murphy (daisy hoot until she does obvious later on film) jared leto vanessa redgrave addition various young actresses who played other patients ward funny scenes yet get tears eyes watching parts like when burned girl polly looks at picture herself younger before don't chick flick - awesome everyone can somehow relate see asap
this was one of the best movies i have ever seen (and that is saying something) ! it really got to depth reality for some people without any sugarcoating . angelina jolie incredible and fascinating watch as a seemingly coldhearted sociopath admit kinda could relate few situations in movie brought up lot questions my mind
this is an awsome movie and one of my favorites . the cast was very beleivable i think blandness ryders character in meant to be that way order compliment jolies wildness course it a little different than book movies aren't as clear because they're not so black white books that's coolest part about we can see differently don't believe these girls were crazy they wanted us were.i more just women who didn't want follow rules outside world maybe even would like carefree are sometimes but , we're afraid people will give 5 star rating it's realistic living
in the movie girl interrupted  . was great i saw that lisa is more like me some ways and what want for someone to tell truth , care enough about everyone knows but afraid say
i this was really good , especially angelina jolie .
i thought the movie was best ! think its like one of those girl movies though . my brother wasnt to into it but me and friend could watch that a million times
this movie was excellent . u realize that some people who have commented on it think otherwise , however is due in part because they no clear understanding of what a borderline really cares if wyonna ryder the fact someone played role susanna kaysen..was all mattered...and she evaluated and treated.. one lucky ones.. could be helped go to live normal healthy life until others,,,,we must never critized which we do not understand.. mental illness happens everyday.. right make light it. instead should perhaps take closer look try understand plight those trapped inside themselves..
i love winona ryder and she did a fantastic job in this movie . angelina jolie was also incredible the had good storyline too actors all on showing what it like to be mental institution
i found this movie phenomenal on all levels . the cast had excellent chemistry and amazing talent script was a beautiful mix of poetry , humor drama plain insanity think many were able to associate with characters one level or another especially reaching out teens who can often find commonalities main character perhaps others as well
this movie was fabulous . the message it sent very deep are we all really crazy ? or is world that so crazy? character lisa by far best in after watching i'm always taken aback its like actually living i love it! ! 5+++++
i thought this movie was very strong . given that it a true story makes even better angelina jolie as an actress
i thought this film did an excellent job of connecting the viewer with actors . it left me emotional kept involved wanted to really meet characters and help fix them
girl , interrupted is based upon a true story written by susanna kaysen (played winona ryder) who falsely accused of being crazy . placed in mental institution she confroted with the desicion her life must decide on whether wants to get better or spend insane only thing standing way controlling sociopath lisa angelina jolie.) director james mangold has been critisized for movies flat plotline and inability transfer book into movie i agree that films plot took different route than most flicks but say it had no at all an understatement those probably didn't understand ryder co-producing starring flick how can go wrong ? not mention other incredible performances jolie whoopie goldberg brittany murphy clea duvall many more lets face we relate feeling little sometimes..okay maybe as some characters eating grapes off wallpaper sense this must-see definetly deserves 5 star rating! ! copyrighted 2000 kris10 r lee
i have to say that this is one of the best movies i've ever seen ! think love it so much b/c kould relate situation well . excellent acting too
this was the best movie i have seen in months , it goes into my top 5 list made me feel alive
was done very nicely . the seriousness didn't get too out of hand , and still funny intreging
girl interrupted is my favorite movie . winona ryder and angelina jolie were excellent i related to this in everyway the plot was easy follow ending predictable after watching it , made me question reality ask myself am crazy ?
how in the world golden globes could have paid homage to american beauty and not girl , interrupted winona is beyond me . this was a touching film filled with interesting characters --- its positive despite harsh topics it presented
brilliant . anyone who can't take their warren commission blinders off after watching this film just refuses to get it
oliver stone presents a great case . if there was no conspiracy then why is the evidence set to be released in 25 years ? warren commision joke and this movie shows that
jfk is one of the most compeling dramas i have ever seen.oliver stone did an amazing job with this film as he does every other movie . probably biggest amount tallented actors seen : to name a few kevin costern , tommy lee jones bacon joe pesci sissy spacek jack lemmon john candy and gary oldman has so much info takes you right in middle jim garrison's investigation ; absolutly enthralling
this is probably one of the most compelling dramas that i have watched in my lifetime . everything about movie seemed to be up par : acting , script dialogue directing and musical score critics film like pander on fact it not entirely accurate well no but then again neither was warren report concluded oswald acted alone assassination despite a congressional investigation late 70s suspected otherwise stating john f kennedy killed by conspiracy even if you are those who believe findings commission would hope recognize film's greatness kevin costner's final speech jury towards end simple point best seen (better than nicholson's few good men .) jfk made an all-star cast with bacon costner tommy lee joens joe pesci gary oldman all at their merely meant based facts reflect opinions oliver stone jim garrison others don't some things suggested (lbj's complicity among them) still think very done fllm important because first hollywood filmt least explore possibility death many factual errors its points cannot denied (i.e sloppy investigation) williams' for perfectly suited his apparent passion obvious more espescially beginning when switching from somewhat cassandra-like theme drum roll implying military connection into human spirit how vigour dedication man team associates can rise above highest powers order discover truth controversial historically events ever reccomend anyone interested or mood thought-compelling drama
watch this film openmindedly and see if you still believe there was a lone gunman.. .
i found this movie enjoyable , pity what happened to brandon lee .
****1/2...***** is this case just because of the fact that they actually went through with film , and made themselves a final product . excellent result
awesome film . breathtaking in its conception and execution the cinematography editing are of highest class oliver stone truly deserved to win another oscar , but was beaten by an inferior - silence lambs costner has never been better should feel duly robbed
excellent re-enactment of what really occurred within the time period . timeline was accurate and actors were great kevin costner also a lawyer investigator
one of my all time favorite movies . anything with conspiracy makes a movie worth while
the movie that made me realize catherine zeta jones would be going places . great performance.great
this was an amazing movie . great acting , and a story
good movie
very interesting movie , recommend it to anyone who likes intermixed plot movies( similar a tarantino style in way )
i like the way they filmed it , looked an amature movie . del toro is awsome ! good storyline
a winner . traffic is not for the faint of heart you'll be on edge your seat from beginning to end as story unfolds who's good guy ? bad who can you trust will we ever see supporting actor do better job than benicio del toro dangerous drug trade shielded it if you've been user , should this movie known had child or think might have and make sure know
a true classic - to be owned and will an the alltime best movie list .
i think this movie is the greatest of all time . saw it when was 10 and fell in love with shows a guy his girlfriend get brutally murdered by greasy thugs eric draven gets revenge them crow brings him back also believe that if brandon lee's life hadn't been cut short he would have huge star rip
perhaps one of the best movies our recent movie times . acting , directing and overall production this are superb -interlacing several stark stories surrounding drugs in society at you forget watching a it becomes so real must see for everyone
this movie was very intense..i can see why it nimonated , but didn't win-too scary for the academy . i thought kath-z.jones-douglas quite wonderful-i honestly she a good guy
traffic was amazing!!!! ! the peoplw who you thought couldn't act , surprise they can . michael douglas is my hero i loved this movie it pure genious and anyone trys to compare general's daughter  will have deal with me if havent seen go see am in love
what a powerful movie . believe me , this is not feel good but it remarkably well-done film that makes you think with his variety of camera angles and use light director steven soderbergh did tremendous job putting together the ensemble cast was great as well particularly impressive to were performances by benicio del toro mexican cop girl who played michael douglass' daughter all in i highly recommend get an inside look at how drugs impact lives ways may immediately realize though for everyone traffic will worst give something about
this movie should be a classic ! not only is it scary , intellectual as well . the audience lead throughout with use of psychological fear to mention award winning acting performances
based on the graphic novel by james o'barr with same title . film really lived up to and its brilliant watch all gothic imagery simplistic camera work premise of is simple - if a love pure it will never die which reflected when eric draven (brandon lee) returns from dead one year after his fiancees deaths devils night seeks revenge persons responsible for their kills off criminals own trademark leads fantastic sequence between him big boss who ordered was tragic that this brandon lee's last but makes even more special as you get see in spectacular
for me , traffic is going to be my pick the best film of not only year but decade . stephen soderbergh took a large risk in making with budget stars and relevant story line agree another critic it drama hollywood has put out since godfather 1972 acting was superb photography (which shot under pseudonym) brilliantly shaky colorful plot so wonderfully complex without over top that too much explain here do justice benicio del toro michael douglas are real standouts this picture though nearly all other characters just as complicated lived even before released favorite living director brilliant epic he will surely become same others those who liked i also recommend soderbergh's cut paste noir limey which used many techniques featured always lovable luis guzman served don cheadle comic relief witty live action puumba their silly duo loved every frame
th drug problem is everywhere and the sooner we regulate it less violence crime . erdaicating will not deter growth of product or a must see for all ages gets your head out sand makes you face some stark realities
amazing
the camera work in combination with a thrilling and totally on key soundtrack only enhance seemingly flawless plot . best $8 i have spent while this movie is capable of evoking emotions commonly no associated movies its pace , action big name star caliber however michael douglas salma hayek catherine zeta jones team up to really make memorable
great movie that mixes drama and comedy . a where in one weekend 4 people begin to find their true selves very well written some places funny michael douglas gives of the best performance his career as professor grady tripp tobey maguire robert downey jr who are two actors generations give terrific performances
ok for some reason i just looove this movie . the action is awesome and story lines think are touching it has something guys girls:)
highly entertaining , very funny . one of michael douglas' best performances at least since wall street well written !
quite possibly one of my favorite movies all time . the elements are there : first rate acting from whole cast , great storyline adapted an amazing novel michael douglas at his humble best and if you can believe it--and honest portrayal or modesty redemption lost talent rivalry above else--an heart it takes to be a writer
one of the best movies i've ever seen . actors and performances were i went to see this movie because loved book , for first time wasn't disappointed with
easily the best american film of 2000 , curtis hansen's edition michael chabon's wonder boys stands out as a classic modern cinema with its exotic characters and absurd story structure . it's innumerable amounts fun certainly moreso than average any genre including fluffy movies in comdy action genres great script spectacularly acted cinematography is superb.. for all absurdity rather solid masterpiece
we rented this movie last night . definitely one of the better films i have seen in quite a while am surprised it didn't get more media attention..at least not that remember douglas , maguire mcdormand and downey jr all did an amazing job forming their characters drawing audience disagree with molfan found film very humorous..maybe because enjoy dark dry humor..you couldn't help but laugh at comedic tragedy weekend life group people for killing dogs..but whole scenario was humorous sick way..i thoroughly enjoyed recommend to everyone as ending..i fact they gave some closure..however sticking unpredictable plot could ended him wavering top stairs..keep you wondering..of course may irritated lot people..thus nice happy ending great !
great movie ; hilarious , well acted and brilliantly written . it's a shame that it didn't nab the oscar for best adapted screenplay
the best movie i have ever seen in my entire life . it over 1000 times (went through 2 vhs copies before got dvd) there isn't enough good things can say about this instead , just make people watch and i've yet to hear a complaint scenes script soundtrack score memorized it's such powerful cathartic response with another film as had 'the crow' romantic violent wry heart-wrenching satisying.. one of greatest films made opinion
best performance of douglas' career . enough said poor omr downey jr
this movie is fantastic . one of the best movies year you will be inspired by characters and story toby mcguire as slightly crazy writing student it make want to change your life
this is a funny movie that does go into both personal relationships and career issues . interesting look the politics in america , colleges universities i enjoyed aspect of writer unable to stop writing his second book
this movie just kind of came and went , nobody seems to have talked about it much . i'm surprised because was one the more original entertaining movies i've seen since american beauty not saying a ground-breaking motion picture by any means but characters had depth story wasn't predictable quality acting high i'll tell you what - if didn't see in theater night you're mood for good quirky rental wonder boys is great call
very cool . about our relationship with work and need for self-discipline in it also entertaining
realistic and bizarre at once . good characters , not normal hollywood types
this movie was very ahead of its time and is still a good today . probably the most justified violence any
a very well crafted and enjoyable movie . unlike lot of surprise ending movies , this does not lose its appeal on repeat viewings
i absolutely loved this movie and paul newman .
this is one of my favourite meryl streep films and boasted a stellar cast . although the movies subject matter divorce depressing robert benton avery corman manage to find balance with screenplay novel as why mother walked out on her son how father manages cope single parent what i loved about meryl's performance joanna kramer that she un-doubtedly did something wrong , but funnily enough sympathised character succumbing role young wife dustin hoffman was brilliant ted very justin henry billy complete natural film managed encompass complicated somewhat delicate issue its time
tremendous flick . just love it
very well done movie . dustin hoffman is a dad who busy with his career he thrown curveball when wife leaves to find herself and left take care of six year old son billy what i love about this the has change priorities make most important , all actors are good after 18 months mom comes back wants have there bitter custody battle ending tearjerker that shows sacrifice for child
munson , i certainly agree with you . kramer vs is a wonderfully touching film and justin henry as the seven year old involved in custody battle brilliant think this one of hoffman's best films well way his meryl streep's characters are shown mostly vindictive toward other but an underlying compassion thinking child adds substance to story applaud for depicting divorce through child's eyes so that surely even more hardened hearts will be affected by it motion pictures do than merely entertain ; they enlighten bravo !
talk about a movie that absolutely tears your heart out . i was kid when this came and didn't know much divorce because my folks were married , but kramer vs really moved me the performances across board super dustin hoffman meryl streep both great it performance by justin henry (he played kid) most impressive scenes with him so memorable particularly one towards end of as they discuss where he will be living if you haven't seen film check sure have some tissues
a wonderful action film that mixes both drama and comedy . the death of brandon lee was so tragic , i think success this movie is tribute to an actor whose career cut way too short
a true commentary on the duality of sexes . just brilliant !
the piano is a very haunting film . story line so moving and original , that it triumph ! acting first rate art directing musical score from jane campion thing of beauty for anyone complains hollywood doesn't make good films anymore you should see this
my favorite film of all time . and it's as timely now ever (just turn on your tv in 2004!) great acting , screenplay--everything just clicks the entire cast was peak form
depp (and pacino) were excellent;best cops and robbers movie since 'goodfellas' .
brilliant movie . it shows what a discipline can do we need more coach's like coach carter in our high schools and colleges few the workplace would not be bad idea either! !
wow ! this movie is my all time favorite . it contained everything a good should emotion , comedy and romance i would reccomend to anyone! because the best ever
a tragic story of man who returns from the grave to avenge deaths his fiancee` as well himself . this is movie for people that enjoy movies with dark atmosphere and violent storyline
that movie was hilarious . you gotta love the little kid
cruise and crowe could become the stewart/capra of their generation .
i have to give this movie a five because think cameron crowe has such talent for portraying reality with entertainment . really appreciate crowe's dedication character development (something often sorely lacking in today's movies) , his meticulous attention casting actors that fit the part and overall natural depth most movies there's hero who's usually flawless supporting characters villains i'll only like/appreciate one or two of them but jerry maguire just fell love everybody
renee zellweger's charm is enough for me to love this movie . i have seen more than 20 times , but whenever see it find what a luck that got role cameron diaz ? mimi rogers mira sorvino no if they had played dorothy boyd jerry maguire might be just so-so anyway tom cruise was good cuba gooding jr even better and the kid jonathan lipnicki great
aww..everytime i think of this movie , just smile . it's such a great own it and watch whenever can.. you know!! ! lol tom cruise did terrific job don't who says he doesn't know how to act the guy can freakin' act...renee zelweger is one best actresses i've ever seen perform in my whole entire life long live renee!!!!
this must be one of the best films tom cruise has ever been in . his character is very realistic and depth renee zellweger convincing as a young single mother - boy who plays her son outstanding well i can't think actor film isn't particularly good thats rare movie runs along smoothly music matches tempo it reflects that society now works too hard often forgets there are other things life to enjoy also points out workplace , you can never really know what people about love when want feel soppy realise have so amazing (my partner our flat just everything) am lucky
this movie rocked ! tom cruise and remee zellweger are phenomenal , the theme song secret garden with cleverly placed dialouge is awesome
i enjoyed the plot of this movie because it didn't involve sports only . incorporated family values showed a different aspect professional players along with agents
beautiiful story . encourages people to go ahead with their feelings it's funny tom cruise acted great in this movie
the best romace i had seen in a while .
i gave jerry maguire a 5 because it's such great movie . tom cruise does so well in it he is actor also the plot of good based on true life events has really storyline
this was a very likeable buddy movie . the two partners are good foils for each other
an exceptional love story and powerful portrayal of resisting the standards set forth by corporate america . acting was great i thought character played gooding phenomenal all roles were with depth conviction
i really enjoyed watching this movie because liked the storyline . also think that tom cruise did a very good job little boy was cute
a man tries to find his own meaning of life while starting business , marrying girl and saving marriage .
i loved the movie , it was so emotional . when beginning had sex scene that my favorite part of whole damn
i love these movies . gibson and glover are perfectly paired alot of action with a little humor makes them fun to watch
this movie is outstanding . everything seems real in ; the relationships , characters emotions and that not very common movies these days cuba gooding jr tom cruise are able to create intense chemistry player / agent relationship little kid really cute as well i'm surprised wasn't more of a hit - guys like it because it's about sports girls addresses
jerry mcguire inspires people to do the right thing and stick with your instincts . also a great love story
jerry mcguire was not only a cute movie , but romantic one as well .
it was a romantic but yet realistic expression of love .
a movie where the characters take central focus . viewers don't even have to know , care or like horses horse races seabiscuit and his jockey red pollard are both down out angry souls tobey maguire is excellent as he portrays hurt anger pride understand each other it shows jeff bridges superb charles howard man who takes in never gives up on of them real stand chris cooper reticent trainer tom smith racing scenes wonderful but does right lives interaction three men great perserverence
a fine family film if there ever was one . i didn't realize that seabiscuit as popular he until saw this it not only leaves you with good feeling at the end of movie , also wanting to know more about him went directly after and bought laura hillenbrand's book on which based just so could read complete story highly recommend everyone go see even you're horse fan
loved it was great
wonderfully done ! very engaging movie
great story and actors . it has a lot of heart i hope to see bridges cooper up for oscars
not your typical hollywood sports or animal flick . character development is a focus , showing the humble beginnings of key figures who'd taken their knocks during depression era provides realistic sense history and why americans took personal stake in races once-ridiculed horse likewise it's easy to get caught up movie as all cast shines admirably based on laura hillenbrand's superb 2001 book pg-13 but many age groups would enjoy it
this was an excellent movie . i can't even wait to see hannibal ! it weird how a man could actually eat people jodie foster great actress love gave me the chills , thinking of what possibly happen next
the whole series is good , but part one best .
this movies portrays a quintesential role for kevin spacey as he plays broken man seeking new life and to mend his heart . it is great story the scenery they filmed in newfoundland really captured imagination old salt characters made movie unique
hoo-ah!! !
since i'm towards the other end of generation scale , i origionally only saw this movie to see what chris o'donnell did before batman and circle friends . as usual was impressed by his peformance but pleasently suprised al pacino who is way my time loved it has taught me appreciate effort older actors rather than all teen flicks used too
pacino is the man . al definitely makes movie i also really liked story
al pacino is one of my all time favorite actors . he extremely talented and versatile chris o'donnell also spectacular as a new comer to hollywood when the movie first came out
al pacino gave a great performance . his character was real lovable but you had to get used him first he taught that kid lot about i almost cried when came the defense for friend at trial happy got out of trouble with help this good drama is one my favorite actors
one of the best movies all time . a true human interest film excellent story and easy to follow ending rivals that any movie al pacino gives an awesome performance worthy oscar
all time classic drama . superb acting by al pacino unique choice of characters and storyline
incredible man , great movie a test of endurance that will never be seen again...... .
for people that don't know about this amazing story of human survival and willpower , go see movie . it's the sir ernest shackleton his voyage to cross antarctica on foot it is most incredible you have ever heard shopws true meaning courage
it is probably my favorite drew barrymore film . combines both drama and comedy the result amazing i enjoy watching renaissance films because costumes are absolutely gorgeous
love this movie . it's a great story , and good family
i loved this movie . it's better than the original cinderella story , much more real characters come to life drew barrymore is an excellent she's not one of those toothpick thin girls but a woman-she has shape and shows it costumes were wonderful anjelica huston as step-mother was great ! good find for entire family watch on cold winter's night or afternoon when school's canceled
loved it , need i say more one of my all- time favorite movies . drew barrymore was so cute in romantic and cool a way better version the classic cinderella story seems real gotta love
i love this movie ! it was so entertaining and drew barrymore is cute .
another movie in my top 10 . this is by far drew barrymore's best she deserved an oscar for role from the beginning of to end just wonderful even though was made on storyline cinderella , it still had its own feel and great i would recommend whole family  !
fun movie . kids can watch
i love this movie and thought it was great ! they carried out the relationship made realistic . note : way talked hehe
lethal weapon has great action scenes , dialogue and better acting than you'll find in most movies . it combined drama perfectly we can truly get inside the character's heads understand their emotions mel gibson at his best-crazy as a leper
one of pacino's all time classic permormances . a simple film set largley on location , ie the bank which could have ended up turgid and monotonous due to its long periods inactivity very simplicity ends vibrant gripping soley an great performance by pacino phone call sceans act as kinda microcosm camera zooms in escaping madness crowd outside media hoopla sonny talks his two wives  again had we been watching lesser actor sceane would dragged extruciatingly dull it turns out makes among greatest moments cinama history imo acting masterclass
this is an absolutely fantastic film that was made in 1975 . it stars al pacino as the main character sonny - he's trying to rob a bank helped by his friend sal order pay for male lovers sex change he had everything planned out (or so thought) until finds money already been removed before got there decides hold clerks and manager hostage situation becomes desperate local police , led sergeant moretti (charles dunning) try get under control but because of sonny's charisma general public who are outside support whole thing media circus you do feel yourself willing be ok live happily ever after especially when wife lover become involved think they going away with ends tragically timeless really shows pacino's magnificance actor script amazing if fan haven't seen i urge
this is a flawless movie ! guaranteed tearjerker . the story of tumultuous mother-daughter relationship compelling , but what really makes are stand-out performances shirley maclaine debra winger and jack nicholson
one of the best films all time . great acting jack nicholson was
they sprinkled just enough arsenic into the syrup to make this a balanced meal .
i love all the lethal weapon films and although this one is not my favorite of series , still thought that was a great film . it combined drama action perfectly we can truly get inside character's heads understand their emotions mel gibson does wonderful job portraying riggs's eccentric somewhat troubled personality to audience danny glover cast as grouchy murtaugh who has his own insecurities about age chemistry share simply amazing really perfected boy what creepy performance by gary busey then again guess it's hard for him take on roles in final analysis definately worth watching be sure catch rest well
i loved this movie because it was so emotional and cried at the end
one of the best comedies all time .
robin williams is so good ! this funny and emotional , combination .
good morning vietnam is a really movie . robin williams does job i personally enjoy war movies , even though don't it's kind of nice to see the truth and realize what goes on also great comedian
i felt so bad for this poor guy (szpilman) ! adrien brody did an excellent job . roman polanski painted a very vivid and disturbing picture of what wwii was like great movie..
wow . i've seen this movie twice , but it never ceases to captivate me i cry with him feel his hunger and loss realize fear adrien brody was simply incredible in role -- can think of no one who could have done better the most powerful scenes is when he walking down street crying there are hundreds suitcases belongings strewn on sidewalks road also like fact that a german soldier portrayed favorable light helped wladyslaw things weren't looking so good spared wladyslaw's life (and real lives other jews) still imprisoned by russians after surrender europe subsequently died pow camp years later tragic unjust
there are some movies like jay and silent bob strike back that lower your opinion of humanity others forrest gump can raise it . the beauty pianist is do both though this a holocaust film , no concentration camps all seen through eyes one man with long periods without dialogue much has been said about whether adrien brody underacted part or not i think he did beautiful job far from seeming detached seemed more shocked numb to me if had endure what endured would probably mentally shut down too first was very hard for time schindler's list few scenes in movie proved difficult i'll admit cried most half after szpilman loses his family but own life spared goes on mental auto-pilot just does get by last half-hour moving makes violent near beginning worthwhile thing wonders putting into perpective even days seeing realize how petty our problems society we take civil liberties granted aside being beautifully made sends powerful message have be thankful
the best movie of year . near-perfect polanski's since chinatown
not mean to be a documentary , the pianist follows story of warsaw survivor . excellent brody works magic on screen
this was a great movie . the sequals were even really good i love mel gibson so that helped , but it action flick along with little comedy and suspense had an amazing story line also
best biopic of the year and return to form for polanski hope it wins something on oscar night . moving yet chilling incredible !
the best film of 2002 bar none .
good movie . about boxer rubin hurricane carter an african american who faces racial prejudice and injustice he ends up in juvenille detention for protecting a friend against predator.he goes on to be is known as the few years later wrongly accused of murder set by dishonest , racist police detective spends next 20 jail writes book his life which read young black youth along with friends make it their mission get out at end given tne justice deserves gets this shows how hatred can destroy lives there are still people willing ti fight denzel washington great
mel gibson at his best-crazy as a leper . the classic example of buddy cop flick performances alone make it worth watch , especially always ugly joshua
i thought this was a really good movie . the story is told well and acting great powerful it makes you think
intriguing , and makes you want to get up out of your seat undo an injustice . great acting story
damn ! this was a great , inspirational movie . i loved it acting major props to denzel
hurricane rocked ! no joke that was the single most inspiring movie i have ever watched . it over and again now is on cable acting great story true
i really liked this movie , mainly because it's based on a true story . very touching and heart warming loved the ending
i like most movies but love very few . the hurricane is in an elite catagory my mind it was a great story (mostly true) , acting and had some boxing also made viewers think different set than usual at convicted felons
this was an excellent movie in all aspects . of the actors especially denzel washington (who should have won academy award for best lead actor) did a tremendous job bringing story robin hurrican carter to life it great dramatic film
a true moving picture that depicts the adversity black culture had to go through . denzel washington was amazing in this film and portrays his character with total passion
this movie was great . it well acted and very inspirational it's a story that needed to be told the critics who slammed for its so called 'inaccuracy' missed point of triumphant man should looked up by those have seen realize his accomplishment
i loved the plot to this movie and fact that it was true made even better . really recomend anyone!!! !
very good movie that exposed injustices in the u.s . court system racism of sentecing an innocent man to death cover up police and mob connections
another outstanding performance by danzel washington , oscar should have been his this year .
this was a great movie as well . mel gibson and danny glover play off each other so the director did good job of molding comedy action into
i saw the green mile two weeks ago and thought this was best movie have seen since saving private ryan  . then hurricane had a new most recent favorite if denzel does not get an oscar for it would be travesty just as ruben carter's book acted catalyst his freedom , has inspired me to read learn more about amazing life
i was amazingly surprised with this story . it's about a bachlor (hugh grant) who hates kids , and ins up getting stuck one he changes the life of kid an though doesn't know boy beggins to change his very emotional but satisfying movie give it five ***** ( pg-13 for thematic elements some sexual refferences language including two f-bombs)
i was pleasantly surprised to find out what a great movie this . it's heart-warming and sweet , yet not cheesy lame at the same time also has lot of funny moments two main characters that you really care about
i'm giving about a boy five stars simply because watching it was such an enjoyable experience . the movie is swinging bachelor (played by hugh grant) who becomes involved in young boy's life and , as result learns to see different way sweet without being saccharine filled with funny scenes grant actor i usually avoid outstanding his role fact he nicholas hoult (who played boy) made if you're mood for nice story some good humor excellent acting check out
this was an amazing movie . anthony hopkins outstanding ! scared me from the beginning to end i shaking throughout whole when saw him win oscars , it again
lethal weapon combined drama and action in a fairly believable plot . one of my favorites
this may be the best movie i ve seen all year and m certain it s one of roles kevin kline career . first superfluous stuff ; gorgeous sets locations as well good costumes a believable trip in wayback machine to 1970 even though , we re talking boarding school uniforms not flashy trashy polyester clothing from that era those us who remember grew loath (you guys know you are because also probably only ones got reference) now for more heady aspects film - is obviously better-written well-directed films come along great while addition being moving meaningful managed address often forgotten subject ethics very straightforward intelligent basic way acting aforementioned job by will say he convey with mere facial expressions what some actors could volumes verbiage convinced talents have seasoned category emperor club was worth price admission rental few months
very good , disturbing and rather uncomfortable . baldwin for once is actually competent in this the rest of cast brilliant
i have worked in telemarketing (propably called you at dinner time!) and , beleive me there are actuall people like that carector baldwin played . one of my bosses used to always say a!b!c ! drove everybody nuts
love this movie , i like to work on my sean connery impression by saying punch the keys and your man now dog . drives brother crazy
finding forrester is one of the best movies i've seen not only in past 2 or 3 years , but my life . main character an urban kid and really a genius he's sent to prestigious prep school everyone doesn't think academically sound yet he thinks took him for his equally amazing basketball ability friendship forms with intellectual writer william makes movie bit bildungsroman i would emphatically recommend it anyone who hasn't classic opinion
robert brown is another young actor that i would like to see more of.i really likje a part two this film .
without question this was the most docile character portrayl i've ever seen sean connery play ..ever... ! however , did i mention how beautifully portrayed his ? it refreshing to see a white honkie become genuine friends with black kid too . we need get more of that out here in life.. and start letting go racial prejudice garbage has been run dirt... very touching motion picture finding forester
this movie was well developed . connery's performance fantastic , and robert brown is a natural while the story predictable relationships formed were very touching actors conveyed feelings of characters seemlessly to screen thought out young boy put under pressure which anyone can relate nothing left in question one reasons why i go see movies
great movie . the acting was superb and plot well thought out tone of this uplifting it reaches to all people who have a gift or dream that has not been realized
saw finding forrester last night . what an excellent movie no car chases , violence or sex and yes it was predictable but that is because the real characters made decisions played roles of people not supper human everything perfect in all i thought great story telling several scenes could have been overplayed overacted producer seemed to maintain a very tight reign on how far affects acting emotion opted allow become participating character fill those voids example scene where wallace gets out his apartment for first time go basketball game lost becomes confused with anxiety this over dramatized effects music building grand suspense moment instead they remain you understand caught up drama some will enjoy simply relatively flat my enjoyment came from watching superb professionals portray their without crutches sometimes much harder convince audience are supporting cast special department feel good does leave emotionally rung exhausted at end
great ! i think i'll get this one on video when it comes out
the on-screen chemistry between mel gibson and danny glover made this film as great it was . played tortured detective who you weren't sure or not if he psychotic , grizzled veteran anticipating is retirement right around corner movie had tremendous action laugh out loud comedy also featured a performance by gary busey
i loved it and was a deep movie also made me cry don't know why .
not a perfect movie , but one that finally shows gus van sant besting his great 1989 film (debut?) drugstore cowboy . forrester has the same gritty style of movie-making (and miles davis-dominated soundtrack) this time it's wrapped around an uplifting story supremely gifted black teenager and discovery as legendary mentor sure is quite improbable it glosses over lot.. connery rob brown are both excellent so you wind up wanting to forgive plot lapses hoping for predictable ending in weak year movies i left thinking was worth trip
hands down , the best movie that i have seen this year . directed by same guy who good will hunting has a similar feel to older father figure helps young genius reach his potential and learns something about himself along way yet it is very different brilliantly written sean connery rob brown are both great (i won't be surprised if they up for oscars) you walk out of feeling but aren't clobbered over head with sweetness can't recommend more highly there also surprise cameo towards end which give chuckle
i just saw the real eileen wournos on an hbo documentary . physical resemblence that charlize theron had to serial killer was frighteningly remarkable and her on-screen performance worthy of oscar halle berry could take a lesson or two from about oscar-worthy performances
what a great action movie . lethal weapon modernized the classic buddy picture (e.g. , butch cassidy and sundance kid) ushered in host of imitators that also pair up unlikely male buddies different races (rush hour last boy scout wild west just to name few) but can't match mel gibson/danny glover chemistry drives makes you care about characters has scenes dialogue better acting than you'll find most movies
an excellent drama about the notorious female serial killer aileen wuonos . charlize theron did jon as evil and christina ricci another job wuonos's lesbian lover killed seven men in florida 1990 she rightfully got death penalty was executed 2002
i love charlize! ! it was amazing how they made her look like aileen . she looked just aileen...but a younger version of this movie excellent , and charlize stellar big break for the end so sad me cry liked much that bought on dvd first day came out definitely deserved all awards received film
this film was sad and very disturbing at times , but it brilliant . many in films when they portray a serial killer you either hate them sympathise with or simply don't get absolutely cannot condone ruthless murders monster gain an understanding of one woman's tactic for survival clear why she did what most all her universal search to be loved accepted christina ricci underplayed the character selby nicely charlize prooved that shes not just pretty face by only physically transforming herself mentally too first time long i can honestly say someone rightfully deserved best actress oscar gong year
a wonderful movie ! tom hanks deserved an oscar for this performance . he plays the part of eastern eupopean man named victor navorski from fictional country krakoshia while in flight to nyc his is taken over by rebels coup and visa into united states away leaving him stranded jfk airport's international terminal without place fly home nor authorization visit u.s head security punctilious pecker bureacrat who leaves him- unable speak english- waste months on end , with no money food stay true hope that can get leave onto us soil so some other agency will arrest however doesn't decides wait even when given opportunities fudge truth gain passage mean time lives condiments crackers.. washes sinks finds portion being repaired within days figures out unique ways survive- like returning carts people use shopping receive quarter deposit (which quickly exchanges cheeseburgers at bk) security- peckerhead- starts become iritated victor's ingenuity hires someone return taking but he's unphased ends up getting meals cart guy gaining information about love interest has learns how english gets involved emotionally confused attendant (played catherine zeta jones) who's dating married job construction crew working becomes local hero workers calms down having dad's heart medication confiscated peckerhead bureaucrat,-and through recollection rules forms had been reading learn lies says they are "goat" which would make them legal carry throughout story you warmed goodness perplexed what it planter's peanuts carrying- say's it's "jazz" revealed was only visiting new york fulfill promise made dead father gotten autographs every famous jazz musician picture except one flew america went all these troubles simply put last signature father- keep much human spirit immigrants come here take nothing granted doing right- keeping your word i highly recommend everyone anyone
mel gibson's acting was superb . great edge
a great movie ! tom does it again . the wonderful tale of man who comes here and is stripped his nationality money confined to jfk airport tribute immigrant , character those come this country remember what america really not promise success riches equal everyone else--it promises opportunity freedom make best for yourself (all dependent on how hard you'll work succeed) fair trade
should be up in the top twenty.... .
the late great sax player dexter gordon was sensational as an expatriate american saxman dying in paris . paul newman robbed him for oscar 1986
if you liked apollo 13 , you'll love the right stuff . movie runs a little long but supplies an almost complete look at mercury program ed harris and scott glenn are excellent dennis quaid fred ward provide perfect support to create cast of well played charcters this history is interesting enough by itself that embelishment unnecessary jeff goldbloom bothers me though
one of the best all time movies ever made . i loved it , aboslutly just hoped they went into lives these great pilot's a bit more such as : by end wwii yeager had shot down total 13 enemy aircraft.that in 1954 retired from testing rocket aircraft and returned to military flying only there is no mentoin at about wally schirra's six orbits oct.62 most exiting details gordo cooper's flight were left out how he flew his spacecraft back after 34 hours ship that systems ethier dead or on way pancho barnes was indeed test pilot 1929 she expermintal lockheed j-5 also owned operated her own circus.the fire burnt club ground considered suspicious because air force wanted land threatend condem acting lawer won case awarded $414,000 scene where loses control nf-104 bails happened 5 months coopers 15 nasa moved houston movie depicted during before still
imo this should be at the top of pile . to think that and titanic came out same year.. but which got all oscars ! proof if it ever was needed 'great good' film industry are retards lac is just sheer class in every department
i thank this movie for teaching me what my history classes left out . an educational experience , and it wasn't even boring !
i wish could be as cool chuck yeager .
a truly great american hero film ! the all star cast portraying astronauts is guys excuse to miss monday night football . book was , movie did right this one of only few movies i own on tape
a wonderful , inspiring story .
this is one of my 2 favorite movies ; the other babe , pig in city . probably better for children but bv virtually flawless as a cinematic experience i liked it much more on second viewing than first there aren't many that can say about mulholland drive great also
i find it interesting that the only people who have commented negatively are a : linguistically challenged , and b desire more action . next time rent playstation game folks this is one of top ten movies last years brilliant adaptation complex novel think good case can be made to put movie in hundred all maybe fifty there no flaws here
great film with superlative directing from david lynch !
this is one of those films where you love or loathe it . a true marvel contemporary cinema real mystery , unravelled nicely the performances are superb hoppers character frank villain truly scary major league film
a dark tale of young man who finds just underneath the lovely top soil his beloved home town , lumberton lies very sick and twisted side . one he cannot fathom until day goes to pay visit father in hospital on way severed human ear takes it good friend from school happen be detective detectives daughter gives jeffrey some tid bits her fathers conversations about case this leads jeffery an eclectic older mysterious woman through meets drug addicted sadist named frank erotic murder mystery begins unfold around soon himself major player sinister game blue velvet is master work phenominal director david lynch most noteworthy works well deserving was nominated for best picture 1986 surreal beautiful with great symbolism out another masterpiece artist highly recommended!!!! !
this movie will blow your mind . it scare the living crap out of you and there is some dark mystery to dialogue that may not catch first time ; surprise david lynch a genius dennis hopper freak ! it's an experience
david lynch's dark , yet tiumphant rebound from the dune disaster . dennis hopper's performance here is justifiably legendary
this movie personally for me has to be one of the best movies aimed at teenage market . a lot times we see using virtue agnst as an excuse start treating teenagers idiots or trying instill patronising life theme they go from extreme another , no spectrum in-between are not their young adults and more films that stopped depict them would appreciated themes used in film : mother (derricks sister) inter-racial relationships (derrick julie) dreams coming true (julie get into julliard) coping with death age peer pressure all too real it very tasteful realistic manner bravo! !
julia stiles was just excellent . the music wondeful , and acting pure art
the movie was awesome!!! ! and people out there who think sucked are probably just jelous cuz actors actresses in movie's dreams came true
this is the best newest film i've seen year. . i think that anyone wh's should see it if they haven't a good movie to show u reality! !

released in 1997 and directed by curtis hanson , l.a . confidential was a throwback to the original film noir seedy detective films of 1940's 50's for uninitiated movie tells story three mismatched los angeles police detectives bud white (russell crowe) ed exley (guy pearce) jack vincennes (kevin spacey) who get entangled several interrelated schemes involving high-dollar prostitutes corruption organized crime is complex characters are intriguing as they put aside their conflicting personal philosophies personalities unravel conspiracies james cromwell does his normal stellar job supporting rule (police chief dudley smith) kim basinger okay prostitute lynn bracken (though i did not see how her screen time merited oscar best actress) on more technical matters pace cinematography well done give that retro aura bottom line very good mystery drama along lines chinatown (1974)

julia stiles and sean patrick thomas were so amazing!! ! it was one of the best movies i've seen! i have to give miss credit she always puts on such great performances- which is what makes her a wonderful actress , this movie worth seeing over
save the last dance is grease of 2001 !
i loved this movie ! saw it on saturday night twice in a row . not my choice...but still.i reallu enjoyed it!
this movie was great . i really enjoyed it stiles and thamos were wonderful
this is a very romantic , different movie . loved it !
i stalled in renting this movie , but now that finally broke down and watched it i'm glad did . the acting was strong believable could relate to characters scenery gorgeous diane lane wonderful as frances -- when she cried with her footage extraordinary ; made me want hop on next plane tuscany buy a rundown villa middle of nowhere if you like romantic comedies are actually true-to-life suggest one !
based on the book of same title by james ellroy (very good author and if you like film should read dudley smith trio book) it carries off style hollywood 1950's very well cast is amazing . yes , story slow but its meant to be want a fast simple with loads action then go watch some s**t films that now spews out this thats challenge make think kevin spacey as magnificent ever liked him in 'the usual suspects' you'll definately russell crowe plays character actually has depth shows his acting abilities kim basinger absolutely stunning veronica lake look-alike (and she does look her) also can act - i'd say her best guy pearce outstanding another added list where he neighbours way behind full suspense twists sub plots corruption lapd underworld appreciate an intelligent plot tehn for
i wasn't sure what to expect out of this movie . bought it at first , because mark ruffalo is in isn't a film for everyone but loved takes you through wide range emotions and although ends tragically leaves with lot think about
this is a very art-house film and isn't something for everyone . i wasn't sure if about twenty-three-year-old dying was going to be interesting hesitant hiring such made right choice as amazing sarah polley (go) gave tender emotional performance of young woman trying do things shes never done before during her final days on earth can understand why she didn't make the tell family want pity party , but you don't well-up makes tape two children their birthday each year up age eighteen then missed sensitive part
great movie , cant say no more... .
wow...cate blanchett was very excellent as guerin and ciaran hinds equally convincing the conniving john trainor .
an absolutely excellent and surprising movie with screenbreaking vibes between basinger crowe ! a thrilling story , actors great music : bravo to the director curtis hanson
this is the best movie of year and possibly in recent years  . film touches on many subjects without being preachy , leaving viewers with room for interpretations thoughts which i think clever music score cinematography are perfect indeed prefer than book can actually be full prpogandas those who offended by abortion incest themes give me a break what morality portrayed american beauty ( guns infidelity rape underaged girl ! ) ? why people rarely condemn pulp fiction totally rubbish makes swearing sound cool violence norm americans rather bored such heart warming films like cider house rules but cherish perverty aforementioned no wonder america has so gunshot cases because used to that still not banned
interesting plot and great representation of the novel . eryka badu , delroy lindo mindreal fane is a ensamble put together i especially like scene when confesses toward end it was very deep
great flick . strong character development , good plot and excellent acting
really enjoyed this film , acting was superb great storyline lines and music...felt good leaving the theater.. .
this is one of the best films in last 10 years . infinately better than titanic (eughhhh) , and a great crime movie l.a confidential mature thriller that delivers goods very similar to chinatown but how could ever be bad thing ? my opinion damn good must-see summary : certainly
this was easily the best movie of year for me-much better than green mile , or mr . ripley..what a wonderful story and what beautiful scenery-made me long northeast i engrossed form tyhe first minute left feeling emotionally fullfilled but not drained
this film is great ! i don't think any other , can hit the subject of capital punishment right on target . susan sarandon portrays sister helen prejean incredibly she tried to minister both murderer's family and murder victim families full quotes such as you shall know truth it will set free execution scene in end was very vivid gave me chills my spine made watching a documentary that's how powerful overall would recommend movie anyone interested wanting learn more about
a wonderful film with unforgettable performances by susan sarandon and sean penn . she definitely deserved her academy award for this characterization of the nun who is compelled to feel anguish victims perpetrators alike demonstrates that gray area between right wrong large i think it makes compelling case compassion toward all
the perfect modern film-noir . screenplay , direction casting acting cinematography were all excellent ! it comes together and of course has many surprises in store for viewer much more than a glitzy remake 1950's detective story as begins to appear at first
this movie was based on the prison system and how innocent people are wrongly accused . prisoner of crime sentenced to death when his partner only got life one who wealthy could afford a good legal defense , while poor had have council appointed for him it shouldn't matter if you person is rich or they did should pay
i like this movie because it was very dramatic . went in depth about our justice system the actor sean penn brilliant
great movie ! i found the gripping and believable . most movies that deal with supernatural tend to be 'unrealistic' , not only in its content but execution as well this film was perfect cast
one of the best movies ever made . brought many tears to my eyes acting was i've seen few i consider perfect
it's a film to watch and experience surprising change of heart man on death row can have . it learn how forgive anyone !
what a great movie . sean penn is one of my all-time davorite actors and as usual , he provides terrific performance susan sarandon also really good in this it moving that makes you wonder if penn;s character the antagonist or protagonist stiry
amazing adaptation . screenwriter/director curtis hanson managed to streamline the story , which moves like a bullet every word and frame counts so you have pay attention direction acting editing all superb
bruce greenwood didn't really play kennedy very well in the movie , but screenplay of was excellent nonetheless . it moves quickly without getting mired detail which is a tendency movies that recreate actual events hit all strategic concerns revolving around missile crisis this event turning point cold war policymakers came to grips with fact nuclear annihilation real possibility escalating conflict thirteen days accurately portrayed myriad potential solutions deadlock like soviets or blockade joint chiefs wanted while civilian leadership more cautious if you want peek at how official washington operates take look portrays high administration one has decidedly mixed record (sorry redoedo) he got off slow start i would say his baptismal by fire played hardball after cuban also changed whole dynamic realities became tangible us and had improve relations else there have been exchange ; something wouldn't benefitted anyone end day so anyways minus greenwood's bad portrayal it's great
i just saw this movie a few nights ago- and all can say is wow . what film ! it probably one of the most accurate historical dramas our time definately up at top list movies last years two things bugged me about film- role ken o'donnell was sorely misrepresented as he did not have nearly much in crisis other kevin costner's ridiculous attempt boston accent than that- really proved to be an entertaining with supurb acting , even by costner actor who played john kennedy bruce greenwood astounding- had kennedy's down pact overall would recommend people are too fond does portray him some kind god mentioning his attempts assassinating castro during term office great job communicating president's struggles audience see
when i first heard about 13 days thought it sounded like a great movie . but the main reason was going to see trailer for lord of rings by time over , i'd forgotten all being from canada wasn't very familiar with story knew that situation must've been resolved since nothing war between states and cuba having an idea how would end didn't spoil at every second this fascinating intense without action sequences high point in my opinion is performance given actor portraying bobby kennedy can easily say one favorite movies last few years can't wait again quite long kept interest throughout scene currently on top recommending list
first thing is . if u scroll down hpulba had written a comment saying this movie was underrated the highest-selling in us and world , won 11 academy awards more than any other so what hell were you talking about ? second robin hood are going to bash by dumb dumber make sure spell correctly great acting kinda shady but overall
i love this movie . it's probably the best i've ever seen acting is brilliant it basically a masterpiece ; film that you can watch over and again never really gets old everytime see i'm in awe
a great movie because of the suspense and build up plot . convincing believable actors an interesting is heroic in end good cop prevails over bad cops
i luv this movie..my absolute fav movie..leonardo is so frickin hott...luv him !! !
i can't believe this movie is so underrated . it made me cry badly at the end ! do care about what happened to titanic , but charactors gave life story still every time watch (well nearly.) one problem though was a bit too long
the first time i went to see titanic at theatre , had bought one of those 32 oz fountain drinks . was so engulfed in movie that hardly drank any my drink and last 30 minutes bottom cup fell out spilled all over lap  ! but good sat there soda finished watching it can say no has ever touched me this much put up with that..lol event next weekend without accidents loved 2nd as well have seen several times since then home still never get tired is 2 movies actually leo dicaprio star being gilbert grape don't idea how he pulled off also love theme song by celine dion excellent film soundtrack recommend families
a five star all the way . titanic won so many awards also great special effects romance between jack and rose was sweet at begining but very sad end
i agree with niterider (sorta) , it really is a good movie it's my favorite very romantic and great acting . should be at #1
people that rates this bellow 5 is retarded they should all be shot and pissed on
best movie ever made! !
a beautiful noir film . you're girlfriend will love you for russel crowe you'll it the bad guys , with an engaging story and spirited performances l.a confidential grip
this movie was great ! but very dramatic .
the naysayers may think otherwise , but titanic is one of best movies modern times and will go down in history as a genuine classic . i guarantee people be watching weeping over it 60 years from now much like we do today with gone wind sure dialogue was somewhat corny you can't deny heartfelt realistic performances leonardo dicaprio kate winslet- they had great chemistry leads made us truly connect their characters supporting actors were very good well liked how filmmakers matched real historic figures 1912 (molly brown capt smith bruce ismay etc.) after seeing pearl harbor i've learned to appreciate better ; where failed succeeded successful because really got make an emotional investment ship entire setting unlike praying for bombing begin just would somehow miss iceberg! ! sinking sequences drama what onboard went through are heart-wrenching feel tragic impact- remember sobbing uncontrolably second time saw cried several other subsequent viewings call me sap that's movie supposed you- takes into world tragedy musical score by james horner love celtic flutes whistles- added interesting touch soundtrack course my heart on beautiful song universal theme not related film gloria stuart robbed oscar her amazing performance old rose at least won 11 oscars deserved
classic love-tale made in the same vain as gone with wind and casablanca . films like this come only once a great while , so you had better learn to it i have
l.a . confidential is a pretty recently released flick that now one of my personal favorites movie masterfally directed with steller cast including kevin spacey , kim basinger danny devito and the marvelous russel crowe must see for everyone
when this first came out i did not want to see it . though , know what happends anyway people go on ship sinks die plus hate that leonardo dicaprio while was tragic didn't think is should be a movie so wasn't until released again in the theaters finally draged can honestly say i'm glad saw big sceen story superb acting superb(even dicaprio),and music went very well with each part of directing and set best i've ever seen makes you feel like your there portraid character even small roles are integral flim about magnificent charcter development but only way anyone understand if they for themselves
absolutely astounishing movie , great talented actors meaningful story very entertaining for all ages.unsinkable .
i saw this film 6 times in the theatres and 65 total . i'm an avid historian of titanic disaster fabulous 1997 movie it was great -- my favorite ever
this was a really great movie . i've seen it million times and i still like i'm not fan of romantic sort movies , but one liked it's bit chick flick good even has humour in despite the being about horrible tragedy long is
when it first came out in the theatre , i refused to go see because was sure that would not like it.. . now have seen several times and really each time
a great movie . good stories for everyone music and very direction an artistic , integrated with romance
this was a great love story . i actually thought it would be boring , but the relationship jack and rose had beautiful never scene in movie will keep you wanting to watch over again feel what titanic victims felt
this movie made me cry . it's as though they were meant to be together , but in the end fate separated them that's irony plus it showed reactions of people during a crisis think what i would do
one of those classic movies that you would like to see again and . this movie had a wonderful story
great film ! i can watch it over and . all the acting is ; kevin spacey awesome one of my top five time favorites
it is based on a true story . the told by one of survivors shows how much love meant to rose so that she would even fake new life
based on a true story that did indeed happen in the past . best picture of year suspense , action and drama
i watched this movie with my mom and we thought it was a great bonding experience . your boyfriend probably wouldn't love
an excellent movie . watched it three times and bought the video was very realistic well documented
if the earth still exists in a thousand years from now . titanic will be there and probably only one this list it's powerful ! too many things are shown it far more than just sinking tragedy
woah , what's it doing way down here ? sure you're sick of but the ones who watched a million times . this was one best movies ever made very touching and not just leo kate thing i didn't however like fact that james cameron even dedicate his work to any original titanic crew or there families he used story line sell tickets people died they should be tributed
the action was great because of all special effects . leonardo and kate made story they were both meant for each other it a remake from old remakes
is there a higher rating ? my review for this movie might exceed anyone elses here . the people who are bad-mouthing titanic can not see between line of criticism james cameron has created substantial film history (as far as cgi visual splender) and love story should have enough touching moments to carry most heartless us through 3-plus hours nasty co-stars , small amount cheesy dialoge intensity drowning all horrible floating bodies i've been fan since terminator he's never disappointed me (with his movies) if he keeps making masterpieces i could get tired seeing movies
even though the movie was really long , it very entertaining . a everyone should see if you haven't already dicaprio played his role well which made more exciting
if you liked russell crowe in gladiator , you'll love him as bud white an uncompromising la cop with a short temper and zero tolerance for women beaters . this movie drags one deep into the corruption of 1950's police twists turns that keep guessing until end
i like the titanic movie very much because it possesses love and emotion .
everytime you watch it see something different and new .
the movie was very dramatic . i like how james cameron used computer graphics to make setting (ship , furniture art ocean) seem real best part is way he storyline fit in actual shipwreck
not as historic entertaining . i liked it because humanized a very terrible accident many people just look at the numbers of victims and their stories titanic made us aware possible
three full hours of drama in the movie theater . there was comedy , but most importantly that caught everyone's heart
this movie is good ! the storyline kept me on edge of my seat . every character showed growth and development that should have i love kim basinger
titanic is the greatest mid-20's love story of all time . it mostly appeals to a younger audience but viewers ages cannot deny it's powerful and lovable characters everyone cries !
the best movie hollywood has came up with in a very long time , and i think it will be before we see another one like . story special effects actors soundtrack all together perfect !
when i walked out of titanic on jan 2 , 1998 thought to myself that the world is much better off for its extistence . it was going be interesting see how our culture reacted a big glamorous epic all about value an individual life (set against this horrible spectacle mass death) unfortunately we soon learned president using interns sex while having phone conversations sending boys fight in bosnia then finishing himself sink oval office and instead defining cultural moment '98 oh well still great movie scene with musicians playing final song as you others saying their goodbyes modest peace completely heart-wrenching leo did amazing job at pulling purely good character doesn't get boring
excellent movie  ! what do ya expect from a great author as thomas harris i cant wait for #2
titanic is already a classic film ! leo and kate are both very good young actors in it the costumes special effects great i give this 5 stars all way
titanic is a wonderful movie and anybody who can't see that either fool or has to be somewhat hard hearted . should able like this ! it's in every way does not stink at all the acting just great i have feeling there are lot of jealous people out will never so they unfaily try drag it down with their rude untrue comments film everyone
i don't think it was by any means one of the best ever , but do a great movie . enormously enjoyable and classic for 90s
cgi raphics with a classic story- one for theboys and girls
it's a wonderful movie , with great actors and better performances .
i thought this movie was a great love story with lots of action , humor and sadness .
titanic is my favorite movie from this list because it has all the qualities of a great . plot was interesting there humor , romance suspense and adventure
this movie was awesome . it very entertaining and made me cry
titanic has everything beautiful protagonists , exciting story wonderful special effects and it makes you laugh cry ! this is no surprise considering it's directed by the master steven spielberg .
titanic was a very emotional movie that really touched my heart and made me cry . it had excellent actors
i believe that titanic is one of the best movies seen , it's very emotional
one of the best movies i have ever seen . intelligent and suspenseful to core
i really loved this movie . had heard some criticism that the supporting characters were more dynamic than ada and inman , but to be fair are reserved introverted people also southern accents not good did think they bad jude law portrayed as a strong silent type who will stop at nothing reunited with his sweetheart what woman wouldn't want lover devoted romantic ? nicole kidman stretch herself she in hours came off bit too delicate ephemeral perhaps we seeing her through inman's eyes whose perception of ladylove was very idealized renee zellweger chewed scenery capable ruby helped revitalize farm avoid starvation philip seymour hoffman masterful lecherous preacher believe if he few scenes would have been nominated for well-deserved best actor award imagine going see lot gifted character agree previous reviewers cinematography gorgeous;although cold mountain filmed romania pristine mountainous country looks like north carolina finally am glad chose birthday present myself ; it makes an excellent addition my growing dvd collection
powerful , often times violent movie . life really sucked during the civil war terrific cast rene zellweger as ruby being best jude law is wonderful inman nicole kidman great ada small parts by giovanni ribisi and phillip seymour hoffman
an awesome movie . i thought jude law and nicole kidman were great even though i'm not a fan of renee zellwegger she did really good on her role think totally pops , don't should win best actress because there wasn't much intelligent/incredible acting could done in that
i love this movie .
this movie shows that anything can happen to any1 with perserverance
one of the very best movies i've ever seen ! it is an extraordinary story , and true really gives you feeling like can achieve your dreams no matter how impossible they seem
i thought this movie was excellent-so few people gave it props  , but after saw bought and watch all the time .
it's an amazing story and i absolutely love the costumes !
yes , i admit i'm a sappy romantic but don't get caught up in many movies that try to be . this one got me -- just loved it saw the theater 5 times
i thought this was a really good movie . i'm not much of fan romance type movies , but one liked everyone in the does great job and story is both interesting funny
i am usually not a shakespeare person because can understand what they are saying , but really liked this movie with gwenyth paltrow it was romantic and the main actors were current ones we could relate to .
i thought this was a very cleverly done film and extremely entertaining . shakespeare in love probably one of the few films i've seen last two years that didn't walk out feeling like had just been screwed $8.50 , would've willing to pay another see again while it theatres well acted an all around with some wonderful lines metaphors point user who said would be spinning his grave can think nothing more than you really have no idea what you're talking about fact argue amazed overjoyed by adaption/reproduction work certainly innovator time don't he happy first still being produced secondly they spun into such humorous form retaining overall storyline ? do
no independent film had success like this . i thought it was so well written , even if you don't shakespeare the writing created wonderful characters and love how accurate they were in presenting issue of women not being able to act then
great story about what if...gwyneth paltrow is wonderful in the diverse rolls she plays .
good movie . very emotional i love how the actors played their roles
besides being entertaining , this movie had many messages within it that came across in subtle ways . clearly and effectively conveyed the meaning of love insight was needed to understand such but well worth
i don't much care for paltrow , but even she was good in this . a truly beautiful motion picture well-written !
dramatic . sensitive romantic intellectual i loved it
shakespeare...in love ? hey , i'm in joe fiennes . not only is he gorgeous fab eyes but can act was perfect the part and tripped through language as though it 2000 made affair timeless
amazing movie , great music writing acting story... . and shakespeare is hot
i loved this movie very witty writing and well made could watch it again .
the theatre on screen
i'm not if it should have won best picture , however .
this was one of the most entertaining , beautiful movies i have seen !
great performances and a true story that are tough to beat;gooding deniro at their best .
great fun ! didn't expect it to be such a ride i even liked johnny depp in this . he's actor if little bizarre sometimes
just saw this movie tonight . cuba gooding jr and robert deniro were a great team ! they portrayed their characters in very honorable way which showed respect for our men women uniform keep up the work
i believe this is life after death . so of course love movie if can see some my beliefs in film agree to it
my favourite movie of all time ! johnny depp is the perfect person to play jack sparrow (oh pardon , captain sparrow) it fab
this movie has so much potential and it carries with many different emotions , such as : joy sadness . robin williams perfected the character very well way his heaven is wives paintings an idea i have never heard before you really to watch several times understand !
this is a wonderfully crafted film . the imagery amazing , brilliant colors are used in way to convey feelings heaven scene and then dark for hell that story profound invokes thought robin williams does good acting job
one of the best visual and dramatic films . this movie is rich with philosophy mythology it just boggles mind was sooooo good i want to go heaven they went symbols used were so did a lot for me love way he sacrificed himself his wife loved her much that would rather live in hell than without reminded legend orpheus euridicye
i found the blend of surreal with real and pure fantasy to be amazing . imagery was so impressive one best parts movies ability deal such an obviously religious topic without referring any specific religion
all around awesome movie . great story , effects and acting boldly dives into heaven hell like no other has ever done
a thriller without supermen gentlemen ! good :o)
plain out , great movie . i loved every aspect of it and the acting was all very well done johnny depp portrayed jack sparrow as did orlnado bloom will
this is a truly creative film . it doesn't just draw you to the main character , but opens doors in your psyche didn't know existed bring out joy sadness nor thrill me like typical films i accessed void now longing fill it's hard explain if should cry stop watching kill myself was trip
very interesting and original . different perspective on the afterlife bound to make one cry
another good drama from robin williams . in this movie he has to deal with his kid's deaths , wife's death and own sets out save wife hell during the process learns more about himself kids on way finding bringing back
this is beautiful .
amazing movie..incredibly moving..enlightening . not only is the story deeply emotional and spiritual..the cinematography..scenery..colors are simply phenomenal
this is the best pirate film in ages . costuming great acting waqs good though really johnny depp stole show
one of my favorites . a remarkable movie. full emotions
i thought this was an excellent movie . very touching the relationship between father and son , how it changes develops characters react to kevin kline's cancer what he's doing or trying do before he dies is interesting watch it's a that makes person think might be little slanted in feel about because have but anyone would like mostly relationships husbands wives children ex's neighborbs whole web of
i loved it . where else can you see life prtrayed through the eyes of a house it's story dying man , and his messed up or with family growth right along all those none just great movie even if you're guy who doesn't cry bring kleenex for this one nobody's will stay dry
the critics such as my home paper courier journal who gave life a house 2 out of 4 stars and atlanta journal-constitution it c+ have gone blind , deaf dumb loony . this was one two best movies i seen all year hayden christensen is probably good bet for supporting actor unless some amazing film comes along when read plotline movie sounded really to me but dragged myself anyway ever wrong ! if you are getting fed up with crap that currently invading theatres see  take care everyone
i've seen this movie three times and will see it again . it's one of the best modern movies ever a rather long , but you won't care michael mann manages to hold your attention has superb cast with russell crowe al pacino christopher plummer is about dr jeffrey wigand controversial 60 minutes episode regarding tobacco industry terrific as lowell bergman producer outstanding mike wallace edgy tense powerful
this may have been the best movie that i seen in last three years . superb acting , a gripping storyline outstanding cinematography - and uncomfortable knowledge yes is true story big tobacco powerful made me think about so many things how critical it to freedom of press corrupting profits can be hard hero russell crowe al pacino were excellent christopher plummer did great job as mike wallace flick
i gave this movie a 5 because thought the was really interesting and like how it focuses on real life issue cigarettes . think reached out to audience about what goes in corporate world
really gripping . if you like those action-filled-kinda-suspense movie and don't a lot of talkings , better think twice before watching this i it should get oscar nomination! ! russell crowe al pacino did superb acting job
a disturbing and important film for adults to see . based on true life experience of corporate america don't miss this one !
this is a gripping , fast-paced movie rife with thought-provoking layers . al pacino simply superb ! the writer and director have successfully translated seemingly dry subject matter made it quite interesting 2hr 30 minute explores all moral corporate dilemmas faced by main characters without getting bogged-down in minutia piece moves quickly builds to climax immerses viewer full complexity of decisions participants subtlety sledgehammer drives home impact media company mergers on quality news information we receive insider has best picture written over
really good movie - it is a long one though be prepared to sit while .
a great movie that lives up to the hype .
an amazing movie.. . pacino and reeves couldn't ask for more
this was one hell of a movie ! i must have watched it like what , two. . hundred.. thousand times and the only reason that stopped watching is my vcr broke bloody marvellous. keanu really great in so charlize theron she beautiful hurts no i`m not gay has explicit sex scenes full frontal nudity it`s r rated but thats why much don`t even know just good got something appeals to me too believable make-sense factor probably 3 out 10 overall impression superb humanist rest case  totally ruled screen because he actually acted big step for him whoever did casting very job they figured everything right : people would come watch reeves be (that`s always sign) then there impressive acting by al pacino few side characters effect attained bottom line rocked again doesn`t when based on book budget ?
an awesome movie . johnny depp outshines everyone else in my opinion great effects i actually did not expect anything so waited until it was realeased on dvd , but now wish would have watched the big screen can't wait for part 2
excellent acting by williams and de niro . extremely sad do not watch this movie if you can't handle it
one of penny marshalls best . a simple poignant drama about the friendship between two men under sad circumstances deniro was great as usual and robin williams gave an awesome performance shy doctor this movie should be on everyones must see list
this one almost slipped through the cracks for me . what a wonderful movie is type of that i could watch with my parents and kids , was so pleased to find amazing love everyone but michael caine believe your best characters saying alot !
this movie is fantastic!one of the best i've ever seen!i watched film so many times and still watch it!!orlando i love ya
i was so pleased to find a movie that the entire family can watch . it had good slow pace something is not common today
sean connery in a 14th century monastery murder mystery . it's well done
incredibly well made . geffory rush and johnny deep are both subperb in this the story is interesting isn't predictable special effect were awesome (i could go on at how great movie was or what about it but that would take all night!) one of greatest movies time definatly up there with star war raiders lost ark
great movie , almost made me cry . war is terrible
i thought this was one of mel's best performances . great war movie !
don't be misled by the other reviewers of this film : is a great movie with alot to say about officers , enlisted men and their families who were touched vietnam war.it also respectful our adversaries in vietcong north vietnamese fought us bravely shed blood that tragic war.the films including deer hunter platoon apocalypse now spent most conscious effort cinematically defecating on troops purpose being there -- prevent enslavement south people . at least we soldiers portrays more balanced light shows incredible bravery which they demonstrated again against overwhelming odds go see if you're not afraid what really happened ia drang valley
the truth about attending iu in movie is great . i was there and coached 3 little 500 teams which steve tesich rode ! saw friction fights between townies students knew a lot of stone-cutters paul dooley gem father ; guys have it just right life bloomington as depicted by way , i'm opening race scenes but not an actor
this is a tremendous movie and one that often overlooked when it comes to the greatest sports movies of all-time . dennis christopher great as main character whose cycling dreams are discouraged (to say least) by his dad tolerated / encouraged friends breaking away , buddy flick study father/son relationships love story all in may be little slow for some but check out if you've never seen i don't think you'll disappointed
this movie is a legand , jhonny depp should hav an oscar its just good
i really didn't have high expectations for this movie , considering my tastes don't normally run towards films about drug dealers but it surprised me . now i'm not going to compare other movies so maybe that's why appreciate much george jung no matter how you disagree with his lifestyle was a fairly keen guy he knew what doing-no doubt feel sorry character or hate him anything drastic just interested in story johnny depp talented as always and carried the film-the supporting cast floundered all without too scrutiny enjoyed very
love this movie . johnny depp and penelope cruz are amazing in film the ending was really sad , though underrated didn't get credit it deserved
what a great movie ! the cast of this kicked some major ass!! i went out and bought day it came . once again johnny depp rules!
this was such a sad story . at first it's all fun and games , where the main charcter expects to sell drugs forever but as they feel an uptick in progress police are everywhere eventually he loses everything even hallusination of his daughter
johnny depp is an incredibly talented actor ! this movie terrific...don't miss it
one of the best horror movies ever made . jodie foster and anthony hopkins were really awesome
an excellent movie . johnny depp rocked as jack sparrow !
my ex girlfriend use to watch this like 5 times a day , i couldn't understand so watched it and it's such good movie . one of favorites
among the plethora of crappy teen movies , this one shines as a beacon hope . based on wonderful book by nicholas sparks it stands an uplifting yet often heartbreaking film mandy moore proves what fantastic talent she is jamie dowdy wholesome pastor's daughter shane west compelling and surprisingly good popular shallow who falls in love with there's some lessons about life spirituality here tearjerker that's well worth
i always cry at this movie !
how nice to see a really great movie that has someone in it who is allowed be spiritual . love story of blossoming romance between teenagers - preacher's daughter and somewhat wild guy shane west mandy moore were excellent
luv it!!...great movie!!!! !
mandy moore is amazing .
avast , mateys ! this movie especially captain jack sparrow really shivered my timbers more
i loved this movie it had so much tied in one was a romance , drama and little bit of comedy . first read the book wanted to see because good two are very different but there still major points from thought is real tearjerker liked how they showed that you don't have be pretty or poopular just boyfriend mandy moore did job she not going change these snotty people who make fun way acts tears rolling down my face when about 30-45 minuets left bring an end better than think would
what a surprisingly great movie ! i crack up when look on other web sites that collect critics' reviews ; they're absolutely scathing in how they hate this . says lot more about the type of folks who become critics than it does film , which is just most uplifting thing you'll ever see (except course roberto benigni's life beautiful ) teen singer mandy moore as wholesome girl believes god and finds love bad kid -- becomes transformed by her wisdom faith over shane west very compelling lead role it's quite well-written too i'm sure some people will call plot twists hokey or cliche but let's be frank for moment : you don't these so-called cliches much american culture anymore so can really called ? what's now jaded cynicism ghost world movies like walk to remember breath fresh air standing out comparison good makes feel hope britney spears sees learns lesson from ms need an exhibitionist freak succeed entertainment industry
this was great ! it that actually mentioned god and used the lord purposely throughout movie .
this movie was very well done , for once a outdid the book it based on ! i saw first than dying to read . however books characters are too onesided and unreal whoever translated into screenplay did wonderful job saving
from all accounts i've read , the marquis de sade was a small fat nervous sweaty man who known for few deviant acts like those in his writing that proved more exception of life than rule . this movie idealizes him into dashing wild figure played perfectly by rush an embodiment liberal spirit rebelling against seemingly omnipotent and omnipresent repressive religious power sometimes as with plumbing facts essence revising story fiction play is best thing artist can do complete success acting beautiful moving winslet maturing phoenix dialogue wonderfully sharp without being vulgar or lost entendre plot -in it war fought words love torture embargo various other arts- movies along extremely well perhaps appropriately always gripping but moves almost imperceptibly toward emotional climax which leaves one stunned wanting will probably never be cult literature at only among melancholy souls still world elevates something far greater even he skills really able to express justifiably so while abbot says not antichrist lewd necessary evil ; way gives devil due
you don't have to look hard for the humor is this movie , but it quite violent in sections . geoffery rush deserves an oscar his performance
anyone that says this movie is pornographic , had no business seeing it in the first place . most people know marquis put sade sadism if you did not who de was before saw film certainly do now ! may have been historically correct but a fantastic for those don't like due to it's lack of historical accuracy maybe would liked better they changed marquis' name me hooked from opening scene good representation what evil can sometimes be disguised as other members institution are unsung hero's i havn't seen down minute details long time dangerous liasons should well
i must admit , that when was first told about this movie...i really had no desire to watch it . seem'd me would absolutely bore but upon renting and watching it...i could not tear my eyes away from within the 5 minutes movie entranced never heard of marquis desade before movie...except what clerk at store have learned where s m came rush gave an amazing performance has always been one favorite actors is extraordinary artist do believe he out done himself in quills  course winslet those actress' who just claim your attention entering any scene she did a wonderful job portrayed her character best mix innocence lust adventurous lovely actress then there phoenix although most played besotted young priest trying deny himself...came through whole heartedly towards end movie...while losing portrayal greed hate intense sexuality ultimate price passion whether be writing sex love or moved as other bow down wonder amazement enticing story
well , what a great assortment of comments . especially from those disagreeing with the rating ! i think that there was nothing pornographic or exploitive about sex none advertisements saw portrayed this movie as sexual therefore no kids (by way are we longer awknowledging maturity difference between 7 year old and 17 old?) would be attracted to for content lets just assume folks who see adult mature enough take it is offering impactful story love hypocrisy art censorship.. wonderfully acted directed costuming sets were despite some grim themes uplifting empowering hope everyone enjoys film know on my top 10
my comment is in referrence to all those that think people under 17 (maybe 21) shouldn't be allowed see this . i personally am 16 years old and have watched the movie , not for its sexual content made by atomicsox degrading age who can are hormone driven like adults we kids should choose now if they miss it's deeper more mind triggering meaning then their loss might want again when mature albeit deprived of seeing a psycological moving film on account some ignorance controlling (there other words supplement there) you educating young matter life (cause going go away) hiding depriving an opportunity learn about humans cause that's what
joaquin phoenix should have won an oscar for his performance !
not knowing what to expect from a movie on such touchy and difficult subject matter (having read little of the marquis' writings) i have admit was both impressed enthralled . this is boring acting for most part wonderful recommend it anyone with sense humor easily offended would like add saw feeling depressed after bad week amazingly left theatre uplifted better about many things am going analyze that too deeply ! just go see fall into story , color language costumes enjoy
kate winslet is profeesional and talented , movie with her in it a winner .
best movie in the world!!! ! with johnny depp and orlando bloom it was sure to be a winner!!
geoffrey rush is utterly terrifiying this incredible film. . also-micheal caine-after the feel good cider house to play such a monster-wow.
my friend and fellow reviewer , the marquis (who loved this movie so much he borrowed name) asked me to go along with him see . i hadn't heard of it except for it's sexual brutality needless say within 5 minutes was totally engrossed in film take a brilliant performance by geoffrey rush add michael caine great story (although fictionalized somewhat) you've got an oscar-deserving review bit harsh on joaquin phoenix but accent aside also puts performance-not quite caliber everyone needs start somewhere is not if you want laugh yet be shocked way displays hypocrisy then enjoy
altho i am supposedly at an age (61) - w/f where this type of movie should shock me , was merely profoundly moved ! 5 days after seeing it still disturbed by the images and story portrayed . thought casting excellent geoffrey rush deserves all awards he might possibly be nominated for! truly enjoy brain candy movies one had a impact on that will last very long time!!
in reading the works of marquis desade , and being a writer myself i find that when you exercise areas your mind bend human ferocity it is doorway individualism identity not just for but what seen through this particular artist . sexuality binding element between humans as life grows so structure our existence will be altered race whole are nothing more than cattle wether they want to admit or passes on moves certain directions ordered there always necessity disobey rip tear imagined sacred sex weapon if utilized such every person planet one way another including most all strike out at persons heart 'just because can' am saying indulging oneself with aggressive attack pysche an old/new own personal prowess however intending make fragile point nature us hurt another's feelings mere conversation animal can truly say work realm free expression teaching tool spirit only tender minds have difficulty adventurous having one's happen torture themself emotional negligence feed new purpose describe their private angers frustrations inhibitions nihilistic desires open up realms mental terror art scent agree vegan pride would give movie star six seven five allowed these unnecessary rules
i finally got to see this movie and was thrilled ! it beautifully done wickedly funny (even if wasn't historically accurate but hey , that's hollywood) however would not recommend everyone...i say you have a closed mind no sense of humor are easily offended then don't . like be shocked amused touched it's just about sex...it's sexual expression repression censorship hypocrisy forbidden love...i could go on rush amazing winslet perfect...i given more stars they only allow me 5
with the release of quills  , film version doug wright's play about final days infamous marquis desade a script by playwright himself we are reminded what power medium has potential to command . presents largely fictionalized account last (geoffrey rush) confined charenton institution for insane through his interactions young laundress madeleine (kate winslett) an initially idealistic priest abbe de coulmier (joaquin phoenix) and cruel authoritarian dr royer-collard (michael caine) author explores issues censorship religion hypocrisy (why do those three subjects complement each other so well?) while lacking visceral immediacy inherent realism intimacy that compensates any losses attention detail is exquisite from clothing closeups revealing stained unpleasant teeth performances superb particularly oscar winners caine rush joaquin phoenix far weakest link attempting annoying approximation english accent presumably in order sound like rest cast though since set france reasoning here becomes convoluted however phoenix's relative weaknesses more than compensated this not everyone it uncompromisingly grim grimmer even historical fact it's subject matter looking romance conventional sense happy ending will be disappointed on both counts does reward delivering uncompromising energy unremitting intensity who choose approach seriously
it was so refreshing seeing this movie after having a bad year for movies . sure , there were the blockbusters like gladiator patriot and grinch but overall i have been really disappointed in out past until saw quills last weekend left theater thrilled to seen funny dramatic well done great stars geoffery rush (from shining) kate winslet joequin phoenix (sp?) three of them amazing about writter/playwrite marque wrote his passions human sexual urges that time considered wrong writing life is what kept him sane film you see power on others himself destruction when taken away from don't want say too much more because people go good previews might think would be slow full emotions drama action wasn't bored at all recommend going will pleasently surprised side note hkill sex can dirty or beautiful fun playful twisted lot things as art not only shows passion living experiences explores topics than just love censorship corruption greed friendship religion if could get your chaste belt off
my best friend told me that quills was an amazing movie , but i only thought he said because it about sex . however boyfriend and saw together were both in tears at the end a masterful piece takes somewhat vulgar bubject matter transforms into powerful story of love sanity censorship squeamish should not attend others speaks for itself
this is a wonderful film . see it think for youself
although some may be swayed by the sexually brutal and vulgar aspects of main character movie as a whole , quills is actually very profound film with an important message (watch to find out what!) this was shocking perverse devilishly funny revealing ; in more ways than one think . spine chilling score adds suspense explores depts evil most appealing marquis de sade superbly portrayed geoffrey rush 18th century author imprisoned mental institution for publication his blasphemous erotic novels aggressive nature twisted ideas sexual pleasure wicked sarcasm delightful insanity yes even little bit tenderness are sure keep audience well entertained kate winslet joaquin pheonix (gladiator) put on excellent performances i found delightfully refreshing compared main-stream entertainment impressed its depth irony if you didn't like it probably need get past surface layer vulgarity but thing can guarantee that will not bored
this film requires concentration , serious . the links between characters aren't only of their lives intertwining its also down to emotions wants and needs - two who are dying both cheated on wives have regrets child genius' you get see what happened one them with being washed up sees himself as dumb robbed his childhood ability show love wonder if that will happen current genius do intertwin in more than way just be patient look at it an open mind scenes where can't hear dialogue because music is too loud i think was done purpose don't really need saying understand going singing same song? song expressing how desperate low they feel a magnificent something can watch again pick new from every single time simply beautiful
this film gets better and with repeated viewings . an audacious a superb ensemble cast , including tom cruise in his best performance for years excellent writing blended into seamless direction from the young pt anderson must see film! !
all the girls in my class had pictures their notebooks and were yelling (really yelling) stuff like johnny depp is hot this movie ! they weren't joking but i still liked even because don't think it was ment to be about teenyboopers pirates .
magnolia is one of those films . you know , the which make think about them for weeks on end kind film where find yourself next day wondering absentmindedly whether that character going to be okay complicates your life this course a sure sign spectacular movie as any self respecting critic will tell and no exception cast well chosen each member gives wonderful performance way in script does not allow actor steal limelight works rather than against it might so easily have every main excelent direction truly brilliant p t anderson keeps up his reputation taking risks trying new things he gained from previous picture 'boogie nights.' what other director would entire spontaniously start singing half through ? - soundtrack worth mentioning good compliments if there bad point could only commitment required sit down watch very intense three hours-ish can exhausting lightly but i advise everyone an absolute masterpiece definately my favourite year probably all time its
magnolia is an excellent movie . the storylines were riveting and acting was believable moving definitely a i plan to watch again am sure there are many things will pick up never bored , even if felt that may start lose interest story changed yet not too abruptly this one of those movies you be thinking about for days after it..and should some huge issues being challenged discussed every single actor gave outstanding performance..on side note couldn't believe how cast also in boogie nights interesting
i can't believe that the purile crap served up by american beauty gets in top 5 here while magnolia scrapes at around 40 . this film had more humanity one look than ab all cliched rose bushes lancashire and yorkshire combined
this seems like the type of movie that has 2 camps on it - those loved and hated . waht mood were you in when watching ? was length a factor for or time not essence story so winding did get chance to appreciate know characters these are all valid circumstances could affect your position i rented 'magnolia' , sat down dedicated myself 3 hours absolutely after wondered if best have ever seen very well be but is big decision make only having couple nights ago acting performances unbelievably realistic honest moving yep even tom cruise terrific stroy line twisted turned until found yourself back at beginning yeah watched would recommended anyone thought habdle kept thinking about next day really great again following night.one movies
i watch a lot of movies . am very opinionated when it comes to too is rare for me find movie that moves as much magnolia did thought was brilliant right from the beginning enthralled became attached each characters personal story and how they were all intertwined together brought out an emotion whether funny , sad pathetic morbid or happy now one my top 3 time don't know if mood in setting watched but loved wasn't so late could have over again long you rent just be prepared well spent though
the best film of 1999 ! charming , moving and beautiful . it has all things that most films are missing
terrific movie . i liked more than boogie nights tom cruise deserves the academy award for best supporting actor
excellent film - it is disturbing , moving thought-provoking funny sad bizarre  . all at the same time cast amazing soundtrack rocks
an absolutely brilliant film , with ensemble cast that rocks . absolute must-see can't remember the last time i saw a this quirky and memorable not missed note in whole thing
why is rum gone ? this movie has it all ! fights , comedy you name
a slow , steady masterpiece .  .almost feels like dark anti-western eastwood's finest work
i absolutely love everything about this movie ! can't wait to see the second one .
really , bad eggs ! seriously a great film for people into swordplay sailing ships and evil spooky stuff .
great cast and a story . very funny was fun to watch throughout
my favorite movie ! it makes u laugh..it gives you a chill down ur spine..it melt due to the gorgeous men johnny depp and orlando bloom . is very talented great as pirate he has originality his own i love
i saw this movie like 5 times and love it ! brad pitt is gr88!!! hehe
i really enjoyed this movie . there were so many famous people and think that made it more interesting is a funny definitely worth going to see
can't help it.. . love this movie
i love a great head trip !
one of the most charming films i've seen in quite a while . featuring an all-star british cast that includes liam neeson , colin firth hugh grant emma thompson and may others it's romantic comedy centered around christmas delightful hilarious it explores complicated relationships many couples from new love to old impossible but end as title suggests all about undeniably sweet actually honest leaves you with smile warm spot your heart
i loved this movie ! cried . dont ever cry not me but did it was great
great movie . entertainment
ok , i admit it i'm a sap . loved this movie definitely one of my favorites for those you who prefer garbage like closer - go ! however think is to reality than that piece trash was true love story and what all about we can learn lot from the shared by noah allie don't understand why people find depressing gross movies so interesting stimulating while dissing beautiful positive perhaps fate humanity wallow in sludge me ? roll beauty well-scripted well-acted james garner superb ryan gosling hot rachel mcadams came out nowhere hope see her more future lovely cast leaves feeling there human race where's downside too pat they indicate wasn't perfect marriage but took work commitment have been married 26 years life not only am glad hung with us can't imagine world without him no easy almost divorced twice worked hard face fantasy joy when two much stunning haven't yet met person real hasn't liked (my husband annoyed made cry other it's 100% hit) also interweaving their young end lives wonderful agree winter spirit beware scenes disagree good portion film idea let children watch probably should rated r once didn't gratuitous sex as most (see closer) culmination outward manifestation tremendous these characters believe capable happy marriages how do : bring your hankies :)
i love this movie!! ! it is the most beautiful movie have seen in a long time makes me cry everytime watch it!! will eventually buy and all until disc no longer plays!
truly the most beautiful movie ever made!! ! it didn't just make me and my fiance (and everyone else in room) cry while watching , we couldn't stop crying for hours afterwards really makes you appreciate your relationship more than before its amazingly done touches deepest part of heart definately an experience a lifetime must see all ages gender!!
me and my mom both cried . there wasn't a dry eye in the whole theater ryan gossling is sooooooooo hot !
i don't know about a lot of other people , but i'm not very into pirates . never saw previews for the movie or anything ! my friend invited me to see it and was thinking eww why would want pirate ? went with just because didn't stay home alone after got out in love again bought dvd then remembered that one best rides made too cast setting everything wonderful really think you should go let beginning is little boring you'll hopefully like there are few scarier scenes nothing worry so much about!!
it was a very good movie but little too long .
perfect blend of romance and drama that doesn't feel contrived . interweaving stories leads to rich characters cinematography score are gorgeous
a hugely entertaining film with fantastic cast - johnny depp , orlando bloom keira knightly and geoffery rush all put up great performance bring this very funny to life . i'm not going tell you what the is about as i think should watch it see
if one is willing to wait through a few dull moments person will see that the english patient of best movies ever made . it perfect combination love lost and found part this movie for me was nurse relationship between juliet binoche ralph fiennes
i gave this movie a 5 because it's beautiful both visually and story-wise . it was made to appease hollywood the actual book based on ! great actors come life-not just main ones
i have never cried so much at a movie before . this was the ultimate love story , boy meets girl dies mean come on what else is there to say ? he walked through desert for like month all her !
i can't imagine anyone besides ralph fiennes playing count almasy . he -was- , in look mood move tone but then always becomes the role superb actor that is made english patient one of memorable movies decade
potc is awesome ! i just got the dvd today , and love it . i've seen about a million times could never get tired of it's not because orlando bloom in like johnny depp's character as well
love sometimes really is predatory.. .
how much more can a man value his word  ?
the english patient is a superb movie . ralph fiennes great actor entire cast even though long , love story worth it
one of the most visually beautiful movies i have ever seen . if you found it boring , there's always videogames kids
the english patient was deep and romantic .
i love this movie!! ! it iz the best movie have ever seen!!
i give this movie five stars because believe that it's difficult to adapt a from real story . it can sometimes lack the feeling original situation had think was well done know lot of work put into they even went so far as find hockey players act in who closely possible resembled team during on-ice scenes , cameramen were right with shooting plays games completely re-enacted and deserves some credit
i love this movie . sean penn and michelle pffifer are knockouts , the screenplay is heartbreaking
great movie ! i just love all the beatle references sean penn does a supurb acting job . very sad and tearful at parts , but it doesn't end up that way an around
you have to love dry , british humor this movie . i own it and never tire of watching has a great story the power lift my spirits whenever watch
this was thought-provoking , indeed . if van helsing is what you're getting excited about you probably won't like film i would think anyway see how there an american critique in the film's themes but saw more of allegory christian faith where power comes from otherwise don't understand ending it's only being anti-american brilliant thought
this film was excellent . if you like abstract films then you'll love one shot on digital video , it so strange when saw the settings of village a big stage and homes were designed an architect's plan house with no doors limited props film's theme's itself related to greed disregard disrespect for human life nicole kidman extremely brave take part in performances all round brilliant very filmaking indeed
an incredable story of ron kovac (tom cruise) a young boy who lives simple catholic life and wants to fight in vietnam for his country . he goes over seas ins up accidentally killing civillians one own men gets leg shot looses the feeling them from being neglected hospital breaking trying walk , finding out can't have kids begins loose mind months after hellish returns home different then remembers with all anti-war protesting going on riots struggle mentally that went vietnam.trying look past what happened there physical disabilities off deep end has get away every thing is america mexico where finds other veterans are having same types problems disagree faces fear visits soldier killed start agianst war nixon climactic scene during speech presidental run writes book called born fourth july thus were movie originates states at debate supporting it first time feels like he's magnificent truly moving deffinately oliver stone's best movies tom cruise was amazing (war violence disterbing content sexual strong language)
an amazing story of the impact vietnam had on this country . it shows terrible true how one mans experience , that changed him his friends and family absolutly compelling;an job by oliver stone tom cruise was teriffic !
this is one seriously good movie because for me it prooves to people how much of an under-rated actor tom cruise really . those you that think hes just a celebrity and can't act i'd advise watch see if have the same opinion after
this is one movie that tom cruise shows his talent . he empowing and unique really did an excellent job in i loved all aspects of
tom cruise is great . acting powerful good cinematography
a true story with great performances;timeless .
seven ? i woulda named it eight ! but who am to say anything .
i always loved this movie . it does a terrific job of showing us what life was like for the jews in 20's fantastic
i love movies that show how people can improve themselves to go & do better .
all the guy actors are so hot !
my absolute favourite book and movie ever , hands down . i loved the cast : lowe macchio estevez...who could ask for more ? was explanitary but you can't visualize rob in a towel while reading !

my favorite movie .
the outsiders , written by s.e . hinton and directed francis coppola is a fantastic movie that has star-studded cast great acting c thomas howell stars as 'ponyboy' dreamy greaser who gets in big trouble when his buddy 'johnny' ( played 'the karate kid' - ralph macchio ) kills soc' supporting who's-who of young actors including patrick swayze matt dillon emilio estevez diane lane tom cruise it coming age rarely seen with depth this one go reant watch for all your favorite
the most emotionally evocative piece of cinema i have ever had fortune viewing . best movie i've seen bjork's performance is mesmerising
wonderful
snakes aren't that scary , are they ? anyhow i loved it . it's my second favorite so far
silence of the lambs was best horror movie i have ever seen . it good because realistic with a story and lots blood
hits you like a hammer . great , piece of art !
this movie leaves you feeling shocked and devestated.. . which i think is exactly what it was trying for at times almost unbearably graffic , definitly gets its point across about injustice bad things happening to good people bjork does an incredible job
if i could give it 6 stars instead would . have never seen a movie that wrenched at your heart like ditd the story , actors music visuals all come together in strange odd way wring out every known emotion from body and leave you feeling sorts of conflicted emotions when theatre for someone who is not an actress bjork was superb as selma poor factory worker going blind trying to save money operation her son really made me think mother boy myself done same things were shoes examine person how far does love child go ? should cant say what do chilling thought david morse incredible found hating him with passion yet so bad time rest cast equally whole film devestating surreal awful uplifting there funny parts many choke back tears scenes left streaming down face shaking head its my favorite ever dont will see anything close perfection
truly this is one of the most devastatingly effective films ive ever seen.when i left bthe theater was trembling and crying like a baby . lars von teir has created materpeice new saint for our times in selma(expertly acted by bjork),a woman who losing her sight as she works factory to save money so har son can have surgery not go blind.catherine deneuve co stars selmas best friend.this film scarier than any horror seen.and more emotional seen if could give it ten would.i almost forgot tell you abou musical numbers...oh well see yourself
this is a great movie , period ! my #1 all-time favorite . one has to understand the story follow along.this for young people i cannot fathom some of junk rated above classic theme guilt and devastation it wreaks upon an otherwise ordinary family tale mis-fit man (timothy hutton) being eaten away with when during summer sail on lake storm arises his handsome athletic supposedly stronger older brother drowns he blames himself unable save mother (a mary tyler moore performance) who idolized practically comes out says she would rather other had survived intensifies attempts suicide try make pain go away.his father (another superb performance by donald sutherland) typical executive today in rush living keep up joneses basically clueless at turmoil son going through takes attempt get attention judd hirsch also gives capital as hutton's psychiatrist end sees mother's coldness danger their realization that love her wanning because no longer warm cheerful girl married so long ago seemingly aversion surviving further destroying finally find deep hearts they never knew existed but still let grief harding heart leaves final scene fading into marvin hamlisch's rendition pachabel's canon 'd' most poigant endings cinema
a truly gripping tale about love , death guilt and knowing one's own feelings in an american family . it's called ordinary people because the events emotions explored could be part of loves any one us
this movie is gross , but such the life of a homicide detective . character development was also good and villains don't come like that everyday which makes interesting to watch smart stylishly done
absolutely breathtaking .
i loved this movie ! the plot is great (though must admit , though liked ending didn't like sequence or some of camera angles used in it) . acting and themes isolation individuality were really soundtrack was almost danger out performing film itself- shins rule for those who don't already know they only played it 30 seconds iron wine cover postal service's from such heights seemed cool if you're gonna see one
one of the best and most touching , cathartic movies i have seen in years . when say don't mean smarmy some moments are painful to watch but this movie is hugely rewarding want give away anything about plot just see !
what an incredibly beautiful movie ! i was in love with this from the moment saw trailer and only fell deeper once it . wish seeing again right now :) parts of seem more like a dream than , really interesting inspiring symbolism is at debateable although all characters film are certainly two most engaging leads ...largeman(braff) sam(portman) alluring being portman's character sam sweet fun around awesome .. one my fav ever talent had lot to do believability role she might be becoming quite little scene stealer after zach braff good his too but it's hard shine much when your just coming out drug induced state numbness makes acting well kinda numb that case he played part regardless portman stealing scenes him should proud because even mesmerized by charcter portrayal her still found myself pondering amazing who wrote directed starred how that? made can't wait see does next music also extremely great soundtrack listen so.. short go buy you won't sorry
wow no one has reviewed this great movie yet . and i wasn't planning on writing , but guess will anyway it style a story characters good acting managed to be very funny thoughout all the seriousness some of eliments though are already little runned down (i.e scene depicting what it's like drug an obligatory leaving airplane scene) manages do them well rest definitely makes up for it.. last not least love music in
one of my favourite movies.. . keanu rocked in this flick
nice story in the end . but let me tell you , beginning is boring!!!! !
great film , not for the easily disturbed . best watched after eating food
hardball was the only movie.if u haven't seen movie ur buggin . it will amke laugh , cry and appreciate young brother or sister i give a perfect 100% best out right now
it is a very beautiful movie and presents the way eastern countries can be .
although this movie was over 2 hours long , the not at all boring . it a nice drama of thailand that time as far location growing up child king and little romance also portrayed well relations to britain
drama-wise , i thought it was better than the musical version .
it's a wonderful , heartfelt story . i am not usually fan of jodi foster but would see this movie again and ms.foster chow yun-fat did job beautiful definate must-see..
a superb movie . chow yun fat really shows the world what great actor he is jodie foster at her usual best love every minute of it be careful if you're planning to catch this amc century city i watched there around dec 99 , and sound system suck big time hope they already fix makes hard listen words
i would see it again in a heartbeat . the love and tension between king anna could be felt throughout film -- scenery setting were equally captivating may take bit to warm up jody foster this roll but even if you don't remains pleasing eye
i love this movie so much that got the on tape and dvd . soundtrack also basketball alot perfect for fans like ending think sanaa lathan omar epps did a good job in when heard they were going together , was happy but then broke disappointed still is even introduced her as if she real player at end of liked fact showed professional players watch over sleep with deserves 5 stars sure went to show 2000 see excellent
its a great movie actually me fav and the cast plus plot of was is romance with sports which are my 2 things it really like real people who swethearts bust up cause their careers soon meet later i mean wonderful !
i really loved this movie . know because it appeals to the weepy-girl type inside me also was one of few movies that could show true nature love just how much hurts sometimes and things don't always go way you'd want or expect them had a happy smiley-ending , though liked sanaa lanthan omar epps gave wonderful performances as did actors who played their respective parents ( think day alfre woodard is most beautiful women in world.) defiently keeper
i loved this movie . finally they come out with a good sports and romance in it also has real life problems think was one of the greatest movies all time
very good movie great cast , as well a plot kept your interest thru- out the loved it . ms.d
this movie was so good . i seen it 9 times and could see some more love the characters storyline ending i'm happy that they end up together in also admire her courage to ask him play for his heart cause must take lots of actually say someone
this movie was excellent . i loved every minute of it the characters could actually play basketball which made even more realistic is a tearjerker for girls - cried twice , but worth
this was a great movie about love . basketball just something that the characters did to pass time i really enjoyed it and , in fact went movies see several times
being that i used to be a tom boy , really enjoyed watching movie about one and written directed by . the is very positive links life lessons things are more tangible such as basketball
the title of this movie explains it all . both love and basketball are potrayed in young actors actresses did a good job with film i would tell everybody to see at least twice
this movie was excellent in showing the troubles that couples go through while college . it very romantic and something every female should see critics gave a poor rating , but they know nothing of what are talking about
this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend . i liked the way integrated drama , action and love all in same plot one of those movies will want own future
this was a good movie . i watched it twice you can watch with friends or on date made me laugh , cry and could relate to because like basketball
the movie is good for relationships . there a lot of passion between male and female characters love what they really to do
it was cute . very good for the younger crowd--no violent or explicit sex
i gave it a 5 because was good movie . had love , suspense drama and story line also showed women athletics have courage
very effective story of young african-american couples accomplishing there educational goals . upbeat and high energy
who ever doesn't like this movie is just not a father.. . or mother for that matter any parent loves movie.. i know would do the exact same thing if was him truly heartwarming masterpiece
he did what anybody that loved their child would do .
this movie was astounding . the acting exemplary both by denzel washington and james woods , as well rest of cast film brought on a great sense suspense keeping me edge my seat until very end (my favorite suspenseful scene is when john q about to kill himself) really makes disappointed in american health care system itself final analysis another performance quite possibly most diverse actor out there
denzel is just getting better . he can lift a script that so-so , to great heights of entainment
i never got a chance to see this in the movie theater , however rented it and was simply baffled at how such great commentary could have received bad reviews . give 4 stars for message sends then add extra star quality film-making is very depressing must say if you are looking comedy or happy fun isn't what want not that those types of movies but film conveys an important john q exposes flaws immoral unethical practice occurs hospital emergency rooms everyday you're poor can't afford high-magnitude procedure too there couple brilliant scenes priceless their depiction exact sentiment i'm sure most audience had were scared away by just didn't get urge watch come realization about ill america's health insurance system
john q is an excellent movie . the cast in fit into their roles perfectly , and deznel washington proves strong this otherwise meaningless forgettable character james woods also does a great job
cool
the monologue given by kevin spacey near climax of film , was so brutally honest . truly justifiable homicide
best movie
critics really shrugged me off john q , but i saw it anyway and loved . like movies that get to ya emotionally washington is great in this
oh my gosh!!! ! john q is by far the best movie ever! if i could would give this like a gazillion stars . could.. friends and cried throughout whole thing. it showed real love , courage bravery you can believe humor. mostly humor from eddie griffith. eheh luv that lil guy. nehoo denzel washington tha actor. his skills. not others didn't because. me i'm huge fan of them! about man who's son has an oversized heart won't live unless hospital gets him on list for new heart. wife have two options. they either take home.. he needs until one morning wake up :(. or other choice do surgery. w/ chance boy may live. decide to surgery but family does enough money cover it. will put boy's name come with money. struggle get some lot what need so far. decides kid going go doesn't stand takes over emergency room.. bury son. quote movie. then twists turns hell ending! keep edge your seat time.. such beautiful every actor in perfect. show emotion feeling. it's just great. am movie! better win award soo great!! see everyone!! (i swear girls. don't wear mascara movie!!) luvs
i generally show little to no interest in movies , but john q kept me on the edge of my seat and held attention whole 2 hours . really enjoyed it had great acting writing drama suspense
beautiful movie shows the real world
i just got back from this movie and it was worth my money . hate to reveal much about the plot , but contained drama suspense (two elements that feel make for a fine movie) had me contemplating current runnings of hospitals press insurance agencies police forces etc.. not mention unbreakable bond love between parent child
one of the best movies ever made . cloris leachman is unbelievable
although this is a great movie , it barely holds candle to the book on which was based prayer for owen meany by john irving . touches depth of due limits making they had cut out large portion concentrating simon's (owen in book) childhood has time and space delve deeper into personality his teen years early adulthood really plays up explains instrument god theme much better ends with plot basically cuts half (or more) so basic message story lost or not as deeply felt there are many funny interesting moments that would have made excellent scenes instead should been television mini-series be only feasable way translate motion picture did allow producers use name novel feeling couldn't do justice he right simon birch one i highly recomend but you read get full impact (aka birch)
this was one hell of a movie . word advice , if you decide to watch don't eat dinner while are watching it there lot graphic scenes in film but that just adds the creepiness plot is very provocative and disturbing i thought brad pitt morgan freeman had unique chemistry together definately at his best kevin spacey wonderful short appearance towards end never lost my interest its 2+ hours thrillers out psycological thriller since silence lambs 
this was an amazing movie . i can't believe simons parents ! wanted to strangle him he little boy you had feel for that cool how his friend stuck by side , even after accidentally killed mom
this movie was first class- i loved it ! anyone who hears about film will shrug off as a wishy washy child flick  , but soon they watch love is very moving story almost remember the titans or green mile in which faith and hope emerge through everyone refuses to accept . plus- one of few serious films jim carrey played
my favorite movie ever , you will fall in love with it . i have yet to share this a friend where has not quickly become one of her favorites great story am the emotional type didnt cry all friends at titanic etc. but did for me !
merchant ivory does period (do they do anything else?) and it right , howards end is a prime example . in we are transported back to time when the flat was just becoming norm london where people longed for big houses country take them away from bustling city life who can forget christmas shopping scene so lush with victorian details what magical set splendid costumes i can't imagine that could be restored more realistically or at least has created an image of us seems realistic that's key acting wonderful great see helena bonham carter play empowered woman after our initiation her as innocence personified room view  anthony hopkins emma thompson also brilliant if you like films then this one you'll love watch over
i can watch this movie over and again . great performances by the entire cast just love it some think it's cheesy , but
do you hear that little 'bump , ? that's where the heart is  . great movie natalie portman did a terrific job she does western accent wonderfully i liked how james frain (forney) acted very sentimental and good sends out message
i liked this movie because i'm a big fan of natalie portman .
this movie was excellent . i loved it because so sad and realistic can happen to girls these days they get pregnant the guy leaves he isn't ready for a baby really like ashley jedd that's another reason why
one of my all-time favorites ! how can this not be at the top list ?
terrifying and very deeply disturbing . to make matters worse , i watched this movie when it was first released on video several years ago -- still in my preteens terrified me gives chills think about is powerful scary definitely good for those nights you want something watch with your friends one suggestion though : don't rent kid's sleepover please no they'll never ever sleep again 
i was frozen dead in my tracks by this film . kevin bacon and kyra sedgwick have great on screen chemistry about a newly released pedophile who battles with his inner demons desires man...i've never come across that showed such humanity what everyone can safely agree is the scum of earth actually felt compassion for bacon-that's got to be highest praise give some tense hard watch moments as well performances mos def , eve benjamin bratt
one of my favorite movies . gordon gekko was a great character because he ruthless alpha-male but you never see him directly hurt anyone i've seen the movie many times and still don't understand all stock market mumbo-jumbo , i'm better at it than without
this character driven drama gives insight into the inner working of wall street . it shows how , in an attempt to be successful if you're not careful you can sellout your values for money thus leaving rich and but empty movie illustrates indifference capitalist system chew people up ruin their lives because intense competition
wall street is a really entertaining movie . michael douglas' performance as the greedy corporate raider gordon gekko made film , in my opinion his ruthless manipulation of people and money seemed completely realistic he also looked part with extravagant wardrobe trim physique deep tan i loved scenes where spoke memorable lines such if you want friend get yourself dog this guy owned funeral parlor no one would die charlie sheen put solid playing an ambitious stockbroker trying to make it big there never dull moment it's worth seeing several times for dialogue alone
i'd say that this is one of the few movies where brad pitt excels (along with fight club) morgan freeman fantastic as always and together you have a brilliant realtionship . film extremely dark full suspense each mrder gory get to hear or see it in great detail tension mounts progresses certainly has climatic ending music really good (opening by nin) i love opening credits an absolute masterpiece
this movie would have been even better with more gordon gecko and less charlie sheen .
its a good thing to see charlie sheen get smacked every once in while .
any discription of the plot i try to give would not do this film justice . a perfect mix suspense , court drama and psychological case study those who have seen it know what mean simply must weather you are into legal thrillers or guarantee ending will flip
meryl streep does an outstanding job playing a dutch woman . her accent is exceptional the storyline and music are beautiful
beautiful . i love the scene in airplane soundtrack is wonderful
a moving story . it's one of my favorite movies all time splendid
if one of your favorite directors is martin scorsese and you think that robert de niro harvey keitel are two the best living actors , why haven t seen this movie? . in my opinion a masterpiece even better than raging bull  taxidriver or goodfellas (wich i really love) characters like few times ve extremely complex personality director makes an amazing experience
good film makes great use of it's two talented leads , and includes realistic overwhelming action scenes . michael caine who is nominated for an oscar the performer fantastic despite weak material he given to work with
the other comments in this section are pretty much right on . definitive serial killer movie and one of great movies nineties performances , script direction everything is top-notch
i loved three kings ! can't stand how people can come to this site and say differently am with every one who liked movie as for the other peeps otherwise you have got some problems!!mark wahlberg was outstanding troy barlow so george clooney , ice cube in their roles thought that showed a good perspective on life iraq . luved it!!!!! great movie!!!! actors!!!! everything!!!! luv u mark!!!!!that is all i'm goin' ta say!!!!
ed harris deserver the best actor trophy at oscars for his masterful work in film pollock  . movie was engrosing and very well made
an awesome movie . brad pitt can be excellent actor when he isn't playing such a nancy boy as plays in most movies kevin spacey was the perfect villan for this
daniel day lewis was great in this historical movie....scary times to live that city......... .
absolutely thrilling . a real chiller , dark moody and disturbing film great acting direction is first rate using the subtle script to its best right upto terrific denouement
was great with good story line .
now this deserved more than one oscar . it perfectly created the atmosphere of 19th century new york , touched on several haunting themes and overall had a much greater affect you chicago martin scorsese is pretty incredible hard-hitting (pun intended) director who frankly deserves bit respect in hollywood he currently gets
this one gets five stars becuase it's about the best period flick i've seen in some time . very colourful , believable and interesting to see a parallel of our own colonial history u.s i'm not leonardo di caprio fan slightest but i think even he did good job - particular role two actors who made film for me was daniel day lewis liam neeson
i thought this was a great movie..yes,it long and had its share of gore,but found it all to tie in with the tale that being told... .
very realistic , wonderful acting and story-line ! also with fairly accurate historical facts
the atmosphere in this movie is so real that it feels as if you were there and could smell all . every detail has a meaning work on accents thoughtful well done music perfectly chosen for scene light camera movements actually enhance story tell , too however best of acting by whole cast dicaprio lewis diaz also when they don't speak i loved way listens acts against latter wrapped american flag kind want to see again feel discover new things will grow time even eyes not few detractors because are many aspects might escape first viewing it's great film reaches your senses makes think can't wait dvd
too long , went with 3 teenagers so they were bored to tears but there are some scenes that simply amazing behold the story is weak predictable getting ddl play a yank and ldc irish risk it works cd link . love in chinese club ! u2 song overrated
se7en is one of those rare films that not only astounds the viewer while it playing before their eyes , but burns an imprint in mind long after final credits have rolled . and for a serial killer film to be memorable at all great feat itself has this movie got impeccable cast script direction,etc. thing unoriginal about involves everything else innovative thought provoking city drowned by monsoon may original idea sunny california being pelted endless downpour ! cinematography was color colors vivid were greys dingy browns black involving cops his scheme things victim something astonishing with spacey's monologue find himself/herself making sense murders so senseless inhuman brings average normal person level reason what ironic john doe seems trying god place where just doesn't exist- relentless rain muted are sign scene roles reversed every time i see (15x counting) can't help left bewilderment awe
this movie was really neat . i don't think that decaprio should have been casted as role he just wasn't very convincing see him the leader of a ruthless gang
great flick . daniel day lewis was incredible in this movie i liked how the movie's plots were on such a grand level (civil war , politics gangs immigration) all while tiny setting of about 1 or 2 blocks : juxtapositioning also leonardo's friend eliot from et! !
scorsese s gangs of new york is a sweeping epic historic fiction as well magnificently crusty film . the recreation mangy five points sector old coupled with authenticity costumes , makeup and other sets offers genuine smorgasbord for eyes that has been dumped in dirt stepped on few times - but an undeniable visual delight none less aside from this amazing attention to detail also stellar cast excellent performances by one all daniel day-lewis however leaps bounds obvious standout group his portrayal despicable bloodthirsty bill butcher cutting most bone chilling i have seen since anthony hopkins first gave us shark-eyed hannibal lector if there any justice world show biz will accept oscar wonderful performance coming year gives peek into very dark desperate time city history am happy not lived through set before during civil war it tells tale effects poverty both downtrodden immigrants so-called native born american citizens we see their struggle keep heads above water they daily deal pig-headed prejudice injustice so violent bloody squalid makes our lives look like life palace though based actual riots problems story probably had many facts involved tales found titanic braveheart  my main purpose going theater be entertained two mentioned films certainly did disappoint
a wonderfully thoughful movie , it takes an unlikely duo in foreign place and strikes the human chord of search for meaning fulfillment . bill murray scarlett johannson are phenomenal their mastery roles was amazing especially when there wasn't dialogue extremely poignant artful film sofia coppola is such fantastic talent ! she treats films like paintings delicate emotional i can't wait her next project
bill , scarlett bravo !
i found 'lost in translation to be pretty much damn near perfect . subtle , delicate touching tragic - it's one of those movies which nothing really happens but for some reason or another just gets it... manages capture something about the human condition and relationships loneliness foreignness timing lots other uncomfotable things bill murray is masterful as his expressions he doesn't say lines scarlett johansson was absolutely captivating can't wait see more sofia coppola
david fincher is god!!!! !
i absolutely loved this movie . there were no extreme high dramatic moments which is exactly what sophia coppolla was trying to capture how related being in a strange place , where you feel extremely out of and time can't relate anyone the person who thought could seems like total stranger if bill murrays character scarlett johansson's at home they would probably never connect but both characters met half-way due their vulnerability connection with outside world
so chill . i don't know if was just in the right mood at time or what it but one of few people theatre who really enjoyed soundtrack is excellent , plot is.. well rather simple and though not consistently laugh-out loud hilarious humor very dry wry funny a wistful modern masterpiece
the movie is basically about david dunn(bruce willis) who does not know his place in world and finds out it through helps of elijah price(samuel l jackson) , eventually dunn he has just never gets sick or get hurt like he's immortal . ending was very unexpected six sense so i'm gonna spoil but this really genius film making great story visuals acting top notch....nuff said !
i am a big fan of robin wright penn and bruce willis . so this movie was bonus for me to have them both in loved it is one those films could watch over again will
i remember seeing the adds for this film , and thinking that it looked very good . was extremely dissapointed bored out of my gord about 50 minutes movie then things changed you started realizing each character in by end enthralled needless to say went see 8 times at theater 6 more than any other have ever seen a bruce willis is perfect role depressed security guard samuel l jackson gives great performance as mysterious comic collector we must give honorable mentions kid place evil guy orange suit music awesome so definite 5 stars
okay , i like comic books even though haven't collected for a while . the language they speak cues leave this movie is written in their and if you it certain things are obvious from beginning that's important because divides its audience into two parts ; those who can see all too clearly what's going on treat normal weird thing drama reality but or three primary causes everything that happens strictly book fare what to villain staple of every great batman he gets carted off end an asylum criminally insane evil hero discovers right out some news magazine nightmare about serial killer handles by dashing situation cloak astoundingly saving day yet have quiet careful meticulous direction m night shamaylan we remember sixth sense  dividing up moments oppresive gripping tick tocks clock his was better suited fact think overrated not everybody understands where he's coming with story further there than tss reaction nonetheless you've ever appreciated dark cheesiness master vincent price's abominable dr phibes you'll contribution film samuel l jackson makes picture kid wheelchair malcolm middle without years healthy social interaction finger pulse phenomenon real seem anything crazy driven act extremes as result introverts guy exist them playing magic gathering bookstores compelling dementia still altogether tell i'm saying any totally enjoy blown away you're keyed side fandom may need something little more compromising has my respect taking chance opnion succeeding good
i enjoyed this pic..bruce plays his part more seriously than you are used to seeing him....liked it better sixth sense..interesting story and subplot..ending a bit odd .
i must start out by saying that it wasn't what expected but thoroughly enjoyed the film . twists and ending were amazing movie was a play on think most people don't give to much thought about does raise question , in mind of viewer if heoes like exist is an interesting concept backed great acting vivid cinematography this 100%
an amazing , dark disturbing film . everything is all wrong about this movie - from the rain that doesn't seem to stop uncomfortable pauses in conversation bleary rooms and buildings majority of takes place lighting horrifying ending incredible acting combined with a twisted plot very un-hollywood make one my favorites genre worth price rental just hear kevin spacey's chilling monologue towards end great creepy flick
better than the sixth sense in overall story . bruce willis and sam jackson are spectacular ending is nothing you will expect !
damn that indian dude who like wrote and directed movie is a genius . his movies are just so fu**in unique all the crap now , but this phat
this is my favorite movie . everything about it great it's got a very classy storyline the story of most perfect acoustic instrument ever created , as touches lives hundreds people on 3 different continents from italy to vienna oxford china an auction in montreal violin and its secret astonish seduce everyone including viewer
amazingly beautiful to look at and listen . the secret of red violin was a little disturbing me , but i touched when realized why craftsman did what he (you have watch movie know i'm talking about!) also bought soundtrack recently it's an incredible accomplishment - according cd liner notes musical score composed before even finished shooting which is exactly reverse from way scores are usually done effect that feels ingeniously inspired by music rather than other around highly recommended for enthusiasts
a sleeper with unique view of history through violin and mystery solved twist
definetly the best movie i've ever seen !
i had wanted to see this movie but heard that it was in subtitles and whenever the video store , couldn't bear get a with one day finally rented . wasn't only fraction of story is history violin through time from making today great done so well keeps you attention really feel for characters recommend anyone
this is a classic story of young man coming age . i remember watching as kid and remembering how dirty thought it was definately shows the morality films has declined over years , would be disney movie had come out today
jennifer o'neill is one of the best actresses our time .
.. . and a good soundrack as well
this movie showed the rough times going through high school . many people can relate to however , not everyone do karate moves
yes , it was a cheesy 80's movie but definitely classic and one of those movies you saw for the first time in your pre-adolescent years . every girl had crush on ralph macchio after that what fantastic competition scene
ralph macchio kicks all kinds of 80's ass . also , mr miyagi played an integral role in the acceptance asians society today
i love karate . am a martial artist myself like daniel-son he can give damn good crane kick
i actually prefer this in chinese , with the subtitles . fight scenes are incredible is a movie that simultaneously manages to be chick-flick and kick-ass action all at once
spike lee is one of the greatest movie directors all-time . as ruby said , it was revolutionary and hasn't aged well at that brief point in history whole fight power type high-energy action-packed tension-filled atmosphere expressed by public enemy has not really carried over to 21st century also brilliant on other hand captured spirit epoch which race relations such a hot controversial issue
spike lee's ground-breaking masterpiece . i love this movie do the right thing is a film that leaves you thinking just stunning filmmaking
spike lee's masterpiece . vital themes for america sense of inevibility builds at the end race riot that resolves nothing
this movie is a work of art . the way it was shot in yellows and blues great to illustrate emotions buiding up shows how people will kill each other over ignorance
spike lee has a masterpiece here . this movie comedy , drama sex and rap music i love it ! i'd even recommend one to mom dad they might learn something
its crazy that jesus had to go threw all for humans .
this movie was the best version of jesus's finale twelve hour ever made!!!mel gibson is brilliant!!!poor jesus!!he had to go through all that hell save entire human race for our sins!!!and i am so sick people insulting s--- out mel and his movie!!!i know very violent.but that's 'cause it be.that how brutal crucification really was!!!mel wanted be most realistic actual event,and he worked ass do it!!!i admit slightly overdid with violence a bit.that's why went back edited some unnessicary in "the passion recut".okay?!!!now no more bitching!!!alright!! !
wonderful , vivid and heart-wrenching . it's a lot better than george stevens' "the greatest story ever told."
i know it has doctrinal points that differ from mine , but don't expect perfection a movie . liked the passion because was powerful and moving mel gibson put lot of money effort into this i'm glad he did went away with renewed appreciation for suffering humiliation jesus endured on my behalf great
this movie was heartwrenching . it made you much more aware of what jesus suffered for us marys pain and as a mother watching her child suffer that despite he is the son god still baby very moving i applaud mel gibson doing risk im glad took now understand why all those people were coming out theatres crying
the passion explicitly showed suffering christ withstood for sins of man (if you are a believing christian) . movie is gripping and phenomenally done i have no idea what chatholic teaching but catholic such that all mankind bears burden his death at time does this mention jews whatsoever nor it attempt to guilt into being christians (which there many sects only one catholic) hype it's anti-semetic
it definitely puts you in awe over what christ went through for us . it's one thing to read , a whole other realm of feelings see
excuse me canadasucks , but this isn't a comedy . is true!! ! i saw it and loved almost cried update : how about you quit making fun of ralphthewonderllama
a great movie , well done . proves to the naysayers just how much love he had for us note samthecoolbear don't worry about ralph makes fun of everybody that's his way it him feel good himself i guess ?
i actually went to the theater see it . was that good
i thought this film was very beautifully filmed , simplistic and good . as some of you may know i'm not a religious person but did appreciate to anyone who thinks that subtitles are distracting - missing out on wealth fantastic foreign films unless can withstand disgustingly bad dubbing with horrible voiceovers think one the reasons why like is because it wasn't screaming at people believe in jesus god just simply saying 'this what man suffered he took on' could have been rounded bit better essence story there scenes him being whipped nailed cross were convincing certainly made me wince hats off mel gibson gone over-the-top longer than 2 hours far more intense kept line definately do regret having my dvd collection
geat movie . it almost made me cry i saw this with my church freind laughs at anything time he didn't laugh , cried thank mel gibson for making
i saw this movie today for the first time ever . it is very well made , and more scriptural (in my opinion) than any other biblical film have seen moving (have a box of tissues next to you) ! say there something seriously wrong with anyone who views remains untouched
one of my top 10 all time.gibson has done a superb job with this movie.it is not even in english !
come on , how can anyone that calls him/herself a christian give any less than 5 stars ? i feel everyone has right to thier own opinion but also if you don't anything from watching this masterpiece are not in touch w/your maker . mel did an excellent job w/ movie the casting was can't say could have played jesus better jim what outstanding experience as for people who saw nothing film and those of atheist agnostic's will pray :o)
powerful , touching amazing wonderful . it was absolutly the movie of year better yet based on truth mel gibson incredible and this well thought different so what ? i agree with bird808 how people were saying that violent violence actually happened rating which is r stands for rememberence repentance realization does have blood graphic images will make you want to close your eyes at times but wondefully put together gospel god most all very done
this movie for sure was not entertainment purposes . i think mel gibson is awesome making despite what people were saying such a reminder of christ did on the cross all us great
it's a masterpiece . gibson did great job very biblical
very powerful movie that sent a message . i'll admit it was gorey , but gibson did for reason to give people the full affect scripture said he beaten worse than any man had ever
what surprised me about this film is that people kept on constantly referring to the violence in . was realistic - i mean come , how can you tone down nails being hammered into someones palms and good these claimed passion.. had too much would be same who most probably happily sit through a horror watch blow each others brains out when look back at history read some of things kings queens especially elizabethan period used do criminals they tortured them it beyond mel gibson did an extremely brave thing by making movie like or not it's given exact reaction he wanted public informed going make christ's last hours all spoken hebrew with english subtitles press found downright laugh loudable well say gibson's
regardless of your religious beliefs and convictions , from an acting visual perspective it was amazing . jim caviezel (did i spell that correctly?) the movie is very thought provoking a masterpiece in my opinion ; having said isn't you could pop at any given time i'm not going to rant rave about biblical fact or fiction how mel anti-semitic too catholic as seem keep hearing look none us were there but what happened accurate must've been like for people who say violent...what did expect masses sing frolic with jesus while he walks his death ? savage yes come on people!! ! jesus' crucifiction beautiful act watch hello!! think roman soldiers kindly tap him whip they carefully delicately placed hand gently against wood cross make clean surgical laceration into side we have heard so often almost becomes lyrics popular song me brought meaning back words gospel prayers other no plot just getting beaten let clue something...that be healing paralytic some want turn kind humane act...well wasn't...sorry it's everyone know this website aramaic latin added don't if anyone else has read reviews polls these clowns claim laughing christ being tortured wish would've theater
saw this film today and it is incredible . a perfect portrayal of the gospel all that jesus christ suffered so we can accept him as lord go to heaven when die well done , mel gibson !
great performances ! music story briliant movie
excellent movie , music and cinematography . use of latin aramaic very effective not at all distracting disappointed in the obvious bias shown by most professional critics
noone moved in the theatre when movie ended . everyone was so quiet it like a morgue anyway , they were mel gibson did an awesome job on this blood there for reason is to portray truth about how much pain and suffering jesus went through dye us
mel gibson made a lot of people think in this movie . all the blood was for reason , it just portrays tremendous suffering that jesus went through to save us from hell jim cavaziel (sp.?) did job showing fatigue and agony everyone theater who watching too stunned get up until credits were over i find out name chiropracter because
say what you will about this movie , still have to admit - it certainly caused a lot of people think . maybe that was gibson's idea in the first place all i know is way felt when left film transcended any dogma or doctrine human beings dreamed up over centuries embellish happened day 2,000 years ago yapping voices priests popes preachers scholars and self-satisfied experts were silenced saw christs suffering sacrifice illustrated had never really fully considered couldn't cared less if film's outline followed stations cross baptist passion play wasn't offended mary cradled her son's broken dead body arms reminiscent pieta wasnt shocked christ good relationship with his friends family he loved mother do not for one minute believe violent nature gratuitous there only bring more cash no real feel fuzzy moments reality death by crucifixion messiah who willing go through kind torture us thought anything else then im pretty sure missed point (oh haven't seen your personal credibility big favor don't review until have.)
i'm not going to use this posting preach at anyone , or try change anyones opinion on religion . as a college professor who has deal with many fellow professors are non-believers i don't feel like through the frustration and anger of trying convince about anything they have set their stubborn minds guess could include myself in that equation anyway wanted see movie because am believer raised christian backround also take joy being historian so for me miss big screen would been major loss think thing really shocked even though knew were was how brutal cold-blooded romans be one reads these things but it graphically film shocking wonder all is god didn't wipe out human race what we did sometimes if there's any hope us while put lord jesus higher plane does seem always ridicule kill best among (gandhi king st peter lincoln etc.) intent committing suicide species great wouldn't recommend small children pretty vivid them handle
i think mel gibson did a great job , for his first time directing . the camera angles were perfect language really fit in with scenery people movie is grusome but that how it happened ! they are just showing you what was like jesus and if didn't then thats your own fault perticuarly liked
i think that cajunmafia should be a bit less literal . how many people actually know ? anyway , for all you said the movie was too gorey well there no choice ! could not even describe what pain jesus went through during time sure grusome bet it still great picture liked saving private ryan but didn't like this because or real snap out of far worse war some say is living hell and took trip back -by way canada sucks learn little more about god before he says things supposed to funny!
it seems to me that this film should be viwed from a couple of aspects , is looking just at the itself and examining in view congtroversy has been associated with even before was shown . as i think excellent many standpoints : acting casting photography makeup costumes scenery soundtrack telling passion story certainly much better on all those points than great movies hollywood turned out lately garner reverential oohs aahs critics respect controversy surrounding production there have an awful lot negative comments criticisms outright attacks seem based more emotion or liberal ideology what perceive fact first rumblings about anti-semitism came befoer anyone actually saw failed discern anything can construed historically factually were basically two groups people involved jews romans christ jew ; killed by but instigation doesn't make anti-semitic any makes anti-italian i'm not too sure how we spin twist distort alter historical context it's like trying ignore germans who during holocaust don't remember hearing mcuh schindler's list being anti-german movie whoever players they bad things happen say (especially seeing without it) accurate however different look same facts differently come their own conclusions (sometimes erroneously) next charge leveled violent (it is) (that arguable) personally although denying graphically would foolish deny obvious truth) can't honesty substantially plenty other productions lots blood wounds making crucifixion depicting kind violence war moview showing death (how some graphic mutilations saving private ryan band brothers?) didn't unrelenting obsession cruelty brutality do diabolical (pun intended) scheme gibson money box office believe mel prepared kiss his $25 million investment goodbye if need moosekarloff betray bit anti-catholic bias (i.e. ...typical rc anti-semitism... whatever that's supposed mean) now latest round criticism centered pornography masochism what's pornographic ? loincloth one most absurd accusations heard entire bruhaha inference possibly strictly clinical standpoint somewhat tenable nasty soldiers (and used days our culturally enlightened times) doing really scourging pretty definition masochistic guys are enjoying (which seemed - you will note) so give credit media for continuing stoke files calling though returns show americans necessarily agree judgement powerful leave taking middle-of-the-road positions either (like to) told most) want carp criticize find fault trivialize others guess jesus choice yours
there are no words that can describe this movie . it's so powerful moved thousands upon of people done spectacularly ! the graphics dipicted you feel actually sure , gorey but that's way it was  can't in will be after see guarenteed
i think this is one of the bravest films to be released in a long time . done quite lovingly , artistry fantastic and acting shines even though latin aramiac however say film not for everyone would huge understatement graphic violence gore truly shocking but certainly don't it was gratuitous mel gibson set out make passion accurately gloss over christ's suffering accusations anti-semitism ridiculous-anyone who has researched that period knows ordered christ die applaud straying from his vision please certain groups people myself am religious person moved intensely by you feel every aspect agony along with him will remember rest my life highly recommend only those an iron-clad stomach
i agree totally with kamylienne . this movie was just simply spectacular the acting best ive ever seen picture and costumes looked realistic were amazing torture scenes extremely violent don't think at all exaggerated it shows how jesus died in real life wasn't really interested seeing until heard exactly someone even from watching is sad ; to watch humans could do such things one another some people audience crying mel gibson wanted be a powerful , by far so gets an easy 5 stars whether or not accurate film does matter no knows what happened its documentary history lesson about christ's final hours deserves much higher rating espacially when selling out nation wide
an absolotely fabulous movie . it was one of those times when you are sitting in the theater and not wondering who is crying , but i deeply moved seeing how much christ really suffered its amazing that recomment everyone to see
really enjoyable and quite different from the usual hollywood fare , with a gorgeous score by tan dun (yo-yo ma on cello) . while you can enjoy it for cinematography alone story is engaging poignant i wasn't expecting to like as much did update : think interesting that people complain about stunts being unrealistic--when they are fans of films feature heroes emerging unscathed nary hair out place gigantic explosions twenty-car crashes machine-gunnings plasma-rifle-riddlings nuclear asteroid strikes gamma-ray irradiations other culturally acceptable
i think that boogie nights is one of the best movies have ever seen . it moves well , interesting funny and tragic performances by mark wahlberg julianne moore william h macy heather graham cast are phenomenal particularly (in my opinion) macy's moore's this movie in particular pool party scenes reminded me what life was like early 70's at least crazy places los angeles marin county california where lived time excesses drugs sex all around insanity resonated with as a child sixties (i wonder did anyone else feel way?) director/ writer must be brilliantly talented person still do though having since magnolia found to not seamless had some superb writing an important message (though i'm bit mystified exact nature messsage--anyone care comment?) just attempt j.t andersen along more even(in prove he star---perhaps greatest stars far..
i thought this was one of the best movies i've ever seen . hated ending though movie made you think and see things from a different slant there is some profanity few areas that are little on sleezy side , if it weren't for i'd show to students in school every where even with all kids 10th grade up should discuss movie-it really makes
this movie isn't the best that i've ever seen , but it's almost there.. . a bad point is bom jovi's acting end of brought me to tears pay it forward great concept should work
i can admit it : cry every time watch this movie . loved kevin spacey , and as a whole found the to be very moving
i really loved this movie ! it's not the greatest i've ever seen , but it was so moving sad and very poignant . i'll be first to admit parts of are unrealistic (i mean how often do strip-club waitresses who have been alchoholics their whole lives suddenly decide stop drinking because a well-educated teacher is falling in love with her (not mention those 'kid setting up romance for parent' type things always fake!)) all if you ignore blatantly aspects apply your mind heart movie's message don't think will disappointed acting great on everyone involved (even jon bon jovi!) one gripe jovi's prescence that near end film spend last 15-20 minutes noticing much kid actually looks like jovi other than highly recommended
i love this movie ! kevin spacey and haley joel osment were so cute the acting was just wonderful brought me to tears
very real . after the movie ends , you're left with a those five bucks were well spent feeling and you know that this could happen in life i didn't like ending at first but then understood why they did it i'll give even though think deserves 4.8 (considering fact wasn't best was really good)
could this be another oscar for kevin spacey ? i think so . was definitely a movie with message thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recomend pay forward is great concept ,
it may have not been original in any way but i think cruel intentions was absolutely brilliant . had a great script,great direction,a fantastic soundtrack and most cast( least the drop dead gorgeous sarah michelle gellar) love this film...
absolutely brilliant film ! ryan phillipe plays sebastian , a wealthy attractive promiscuous young man who make bet with his step-sister (sarah-michelle gellar) . the is to sleep published virgin (reese witherspoon) wonderful twist at end must see
i have to admit...when first saw the ads for this movie was highly pesimistic . now after seeing it , how wrong judge! ! (obviously if you don't mind reading sub text at bottom of your television screen than should be alright watching movie.) found myself crying end beautifully crafted and amazing fighting scenes could hardly move so enthralled seriously
one of the coolest movies i've ever seen . i'm hooked on it ! was sexy , dark and a bit confusing i didn't get first time saw but when watched more became little clearer not crystal clear am still unsure in some parts it's movie that will keep you guessing that's for sure naomi watts laura elena harring are both very beautiful too think so sad diane shot herself tragic lynch is stellar! this his great works
sassy , sexy and provocative film has the best direction of year offers fine performances .
fantastic movie , one of the saddest movies ever . if this doesn't make you shed a tear no will mel gibson is great and perfect for role every aspect was from battles to character development all around everyone should see it
like an edward hopper painting ; full of silence , loneliness and urban despair .
greatest martial arts film in history .
i liked this movie...and...the the indian witchdoctor could not have been acting !
i love virgins
excellent movie . the thing that got me hooked was dreaminess of it music flowed lighting contrasts were genious way mood changed from being dreamy to eery although strange at times , depicts perfectly how teenagers can feel sofia coppola's talent really becomes obvious in this dramatic ..you're a stone fox.
confusing but still a good kung-fu film exellently coreographed . runing up walls just liike the matrix jummping from roof top to sword fighting an all round bit stupid at end though
i was anxious to see the virgin suicides ever since read book saw sofia coppola's short film lick star  . not , by any means disappointed plot described many times over in other reviews i'll go that just say this is truly a masterpiece of movie james woods gave best performance his career as did kathleen turner and kristen dunst josh hardnett also an amazing job (i think he well highly inferior 'o') deep sorrow felt sisters so conveyed even knowing ending still left speechless at it's end recommend (and jeffery eugenides...which spelled horribly wrong)
much better than i expected . harnett dunst , along with woods were really good
this haunting tell of 5 sisters was amazing . the dying trees symbolized girls themselves , and their hope sun lux fell in love with man whore who turn screws her head then she alone lock down are doomed for suiicide fate general what life has mapped out them... almost a direct story my but more twist....
one of my now favorite films . a truely stunning directorial debute by sophia coppola her flair for that which is visually beautiful and dark amazing i've heard from alot people who didn't like the ending why did girls kill themselves ? sky blue what meaning life do we all want easy answer must it be pre packaged handed to us there an everything i ask just watched marveled at such imaginative portrait love lost very deep meaningful film work art
this is a haunting movie that forces us to think about the dark side of everything beautiful . with memorable music , and cast match virgin suicides film should've been made couldn't have any better
stylish and graceful , done in mandarin not with cheesy cliched american accents beautiful settings an authentic chineese feel to it a solid storyline great martial arts . definatly art
the movie was great . is haunting and i can't get girls out of my mind only wish that had read book first
i thought it was a fantastic film ! respect all the other opinions but definitley do not agree with them whatsoever symbolism incredibly indepth. . from elm trees , to sun being symbolic of hope course lux concentrated on most because she vital catalyst for girls freedom. only one who dared step outisde square. what suggest you didn't understand is watch again and note down re-occurring images try (they're usually portrayed quite obviously through either static or just out place images) then begin flow story guarantee once fully you'll think it's
a heart warming story with great performance from robin williams and fine suporting cast .
i am all for movies that made from real life drama . in my opinion , hope it struck a nerve the medical community don't know about you but get sick of being treated as an insurance claim when walk through emergency room
patch adams hit on a reality that many doctors fail to realize.. . you need care about your patients and treat them with times people get hurt or are sick there's nothing worse than sitting in an office waiting for some arrogant know it all doctor write prescription robitissin
i really like movies that are true or based on stories . patch adams showed a man who was as low can be and he pulled himself up made it to med school love how with the patients , loved his attitude about medicine
robin williams is brilliant . he hilarious in this movie there are a few sad moments , but what's good without one at least it ends great way and surprises the audience with his nude butt
robin williams was great for this movie . he showed how to stand up yourself when everyone is against you tells not give up- be persistent although it pretty sad , the good because based on a true story
i loved it , except when the women did . fact that was true all more intriguing much to be learned from
helps prioritize what's important in life . emphasizes the importance of people makes you want to stand up for your beliefs
i liked this particular story because it is a moving with comedy and drama . patch adams went out of his way to prove that laughter could be treatment used in medicine he made people smile when they were dying inside
this is an awesome , incredible movie! ! one of the best out and my favorites! story almost too powerful for its own good as slightly emotional among us probably had trouble staying dry-eyed through parts . but it never got overly sappy at all - pathetic just a great warm movie patch adams man has become true to life heros
i rewatched this movie about a year ago , and couldn't get past leo's terrible 'acting' . but when was teen absolutely loved it so i'll rate from that perspective anyone older than 16 should probably stay away
i loved it ! love all the movies that director has done . baz is awesome
a true interpretation ! shakespeare would be proud
people either love it or hate and that's because strikes a chord . this movie had some of the best costume set design i've ever seen i sure hope they bunch fire extinguishers for vault scene soundtrack was also incredible i'm still trying to find recording opera singing in death though it's violent , sharp exhilarating blow senses is one where thought dicaprio did decent acting once you get past his teen idol facade luhrman went out on limb with he stayed very true ambiance that shakespeare created shocked but just so damn creative !
every year i see this film at least once and it never fails to take my breath away . is an absolutely wonderful , flaws all baz luhrmann has credit for the vision that he had way executed was pure genius but bulk of appreciation admiration goes leonardo dicaprio claire danes were simply riveting as two star-crossed lovers have seen such esquisite chemistry between leads a so vital story there big time on their own they pretty great together are dynamite can't wait till next watch again
i love it . was awonderful movie gave new life to the story
baz luhrmann did a great job with keeping the script to original play , and interpreting content as well . camera work music combined shakespeare's words were fantastic it has been increasingly popular rework plays in films (10 things i hate about you hamlet etc) leo dicaprio claire danes act out starcrossed lovers very there definately was an acting spark between two pete postlewhaite outstanding friar brown tattoo of cross on his back touch hollywood can be good at producing movies merit this is one them
the best interpretation i've seen of shakepearean tragedy . actors make you feel emotionally connected lessons learned from this movie are clearly portrayed a sad story that shows emotions forbidden love
a modern version of this classic using the original words couldn't have been done better . it was edgy , violent sappy and dramatic if shakespeare still alive he'd approve updated story movie brings home in way we can relate to without losing any meaning
a misunderstood film . this story is based on an old chinese tale  .yes , the flying something you have to look past but our legendary of paul revere just as fictional cthd one most beautifully shot films i ever seen incredible cinematography decent acting terrific fight scenes it simply beautiful watch- scenery costumes locations are phenomenal
i think this is an excellent remake of the original romeo and juliet . it had it's similarities movie but brought out recent world
dicaprio acts a real romeo who contrats perfectly well with all the violence , hatred and exhuberantly burning in colours some even grotesque scenery . director was genius capturing esence of story genuis at casting too shakespeare would have loved it ! best r j i ever seen
if any film can be credited with bringing back the magic and mysticism of motion picture within last few years , crouching tiger hidden dragon is it . very beatuiful eloquent respectful when must rough performances are first-class ang lee's direction definately oscar-worthy (he should have won but soderborgh was tough competition) all-around fantastic as joel siegel put one greatest movies ever made !
delicious . dicaprio and danes are great
this movie really should have pulled in more money at the box office . it's a beautifully directed film with beauty every scene claire danes and leonardo dicaprio are great together too
the acting in this movie was beyond exceptional , some of best i have ever seen . leonardo dicaprio born to play romeo he made myth real
i love the modern twist on play ! this is one of most visually pleasing movies i've ever seen . artsy feel
i enjoyed this flick , but realize that it was not exactly historical . enjoy for the spirit of nationalism helped contribute to scots king edward a fright and think he is portrayed quite accurately defenestration scene his son's advisor priceless
i was completely blown away by this beautiful and brilliant film . certainly a great martial arts , but also drama you learn to cheer it's so the fight scenes are sheer genius in bambo trees nightime villiage far superior gladiator  which took best picture award 2001 oscar night incredibly entertaining just see it summary : wonderful
i give this film five stars mainly for the acting (especially on part of wonderfully talented young leo dicaprio) and art direction . two leads are so alive their passion one another seems real watch out lead actors because they ones that truly make what it is
strange version of this classic play , but when we've first got used to it it's very romantic with great acting from both gender ! :o)
i'm still kind of digesting this movie , but i loved it . parts were slow contrived found the whole thing together touching and funny odd bowie soundtrack with portuguese accoustic versions played by a character in film just awesome don't really know what else to say - creative cool modeled loosely off old jacque cousteau documentaries crazy storyline set against sailor / explorer starting get
i have to say enjoyed ang lee's mythical,expectation-confounding chinese adventure immensely.some thought the gravity-defying roof-top and tree-top sequences preposterous,(they do require suspension of disbelief but no more so than many hollywood action movies where hero narrowly avoids a multitude bullets bombs,defeating evil single-handedly),while some martial arts purists wanting bruce-lee style demonstration may be disappointed.crouching tiger is not merely movie;it's slice rich,magical romantic escapism,set in motion by theft legendary sword.it brings together 2 asia's finest,chow yun fat michelle yeoh,both extremely engaging suitably noble their opposition scheming witchcraft.the film opens out beautifully into spectacular landscapes which long inspired my imagination.special effects,cinematography camerawork are first-rate,while vivacious young zhang yiyi revelation.the distinguished british critic gilbert adair signed off his sunday newspaper column,having fallen love with her!i was glad see such strong female characters leading roles.the pushed all right buttons for me(if everyone):though i've seen numerous better or meaningful foreign language films,the oscar success deserved.anyone whose appetite adventures has been whetted want check king hu's extraordinary touch zen(1969),which fellow taiwanese lee,among others,admires enormously.of far-eastern films general,i'd most strongly recommend trio quite awesome japanese masterpieces,sansho bailiff (mizoguchi),seven samurai(kurosawa)and tokyo story (ozu) .
i enjoyed the older crowd making a comeback . it's amazing how quickly they accomplished their feats for over hill gang
one of the best movies summer ! great cast with equally plot . just incredible
after it was over i realized how good was..really movie , especially if you watch mandarin with subtitles really is cool .
i thought it was a superb version of excellent graphic novel .
a great cinematic achievement . cinematography , script acting and direction are flawless i would easily put it in the top fifty films of all time possibly fairly high that rank newman is superb law exquisite hanks role his life fact outside bank-robbing being totally mobbed up hanks' character many ways replication my father may be colouring judgement if damned to its fine movie
i've never seen this movie , but i want to because like movies that have the brat pack and love rob lowe . a lot of people said it was good
those who haven't seen it : it's overhyped , but worth looking at . got love and fighting up the wazoo a worthwhile plot with some extremely admirable heroes villains range from naughty to annoying is basic wire fu more ambitious settings than typical guys flying around movies china aforementioned characters *try* lend all epic sweep give chance have was that story between little thief girl her kidnapper most cumbersome distracting thing ever ? cares about episode helsinke syndrome wouldn't you rather mature master older babe loved him get on might tainted their purity face nothing i mean could redeem tramp for killing chow yun fat's guy i'll this when yeoh beats would-be apprentices in bar master's sword process pretty much takes out itself she took own life end movie's magic came through me 5 stars despite strained bits
defined the times . great flick
i love st . elmo's fire b/c it is a typical '80s movie & the music/movies from that time
it is definately a movie to watch with the family . i found be very entertaining and witty at times , nicholas cage as always gave an awesome performance really enjoyed watching cage's character change throughout film going from rich snobbish playboy man one worth seeing
great chemistry between nicholas and tia - solid plot funny keeps you watching should have gotten better , longer play in the theatres
very good indeed . it was not only a wonderful story , with more than the one simple hollywood-trick composed in way that gave harmony to clear shots and clean colours.. i felt watching of course terribly sad.and at time would have wanted li mu bai end fashion but suppose movie been as if hadn't film because every see notice new things
i really liked this movie because it depicted the life of a woman who you can be angry with , but also pity . beverly (drew barrymore) isn't too intelligent she's dumb and naive falls in love easily then she gets pregnant is forced to marry junkie crazy adventures her begin ! starts off as ignorant heavily lacking brains department type girl comes out made own success
that movie has a good message . it shows moral i would watch over and again
a memorable film . gorgeous choreography and cinematography fluid direction beautiful , music that perfectly compliments the acting is excellent an emotional experience i urge you to see this
charming and funny comedy-drama .
a loverly story .
this movie made me go awwwwww!!! ! i love those sweetheart movies it was so beautifully done , and the nyc/sf setting romantic both cusak beckinsale were incredible laughed hard at that guy who worked bloomingdales molly shannon's character....oh yeah little kid in devil costume elevator trying to disrupt fate oh you've gotta see for yourself what a sweet movie!!! :)
intresting storyline and denzel eithan hawke both did good in this movie .
face it yall this movie is 4 black ppl
denzel can play just about any role . at first you would believe is a rough good cop , but he really crooked that takes day rookie for hell of joy ride great movie !
denzel , is too much . he the best
a story about violence , but not showing any of the gore . maybe we can learn something from this loved fantasy camera work,and course flying
well done and good to watch .
this is one of my favorite movies all time . mel's performace top notch here and the cinematography breath taking i agree that battle scenes are spectacular broke new ground want to add score film gives me goose bumps it fits perfectly well with or just wonderfully as stand alone compositions music riveting mel did a heck job telling story
this movie is excellent . if you love martial arts movies , a for the special effects are really good although it's obvious that things these people doing at time impossible fight scenes amazing and it has great story makes from us look terrible !
i loved this movie . it has the best original screenplay written all year maybe cast assembled too joan allen and gary oldman give some of their performances ever , but neither can compare to jeff bridges he's really amusing as a president character seems more focused on food than running country his final speech at end is one monologues i've heard in years it's bad wasn't successful can't see anyone disliking rent if you get chance doubt you'll be disapointed
i really thought the acting was well done . it's a pretty interesting movie and sy (robin williams) is invoking character who's so creepy yet pitiful
all i can say is wwwwooowwww
a really good family movie . i've seen it 3 times (in one day) the actors did such wonderful job alexis bledel , newcomer to acting was perfect for role of winnie then ever joyful jesse tuck played by jonathan jackson and sissy spasek william hurt ben kingsley scott it's i found followed book very well besides romance part that still added lot as whole story written begin with directed all in everyone can enjoy again
this was absolutely the best movie of year . extremely well-written and acted you'd think , reading about that it would be sappy and/or depressing - wasn't never dwelled on bad stuff had many laugh-out-loud scenes truly a pleasure
simply the best movie i have seen in years . so incredibly real ! beautifully understated it's rare that you see a where actually beleive every single event happening - and word spoken on screen life translated mark ruffalo laura linney are both devastatingly good bravo!!
i just finished watching this movie for a second time and love it even more . if you want car chases , gun fights romance or comedy then you'll be disappointed to see real one with substance 25th hour is good an awesome look at man who had all (great friends of his life loving father etc.) threw away spike lee gets the audience feel what characters also proves that than movies about race he made wonderful human suffering
a great movie about man reflecting on the wrong he has done in his life , and trying to salvage what is left . spike lee made film edward norton amazing like always
salma hayek pushed for years to get this bio-pic made and i thank god she did . easily one of my favorite movies all time usually hate bio-pics see the way movie was pulled off amazing story an artists rise fame but more about hardships endured during her life compelling stuff worth expand your mind watch it you will not be dissappointed
a lot of my friends from hong kong said it was very typical . as western viewer i thought amazing ! love michelle yeoh! actor
military aspects realistic . gave tremendous insight into the complexity of decisions under combat conditions , which must be made instantaneously a hint as to turmoil that most don't experience : being shot at by unhappy people
an excellent example of political and military life .
in his best role yet , adam sandler plays the strangest and most awkward character that i've ever seen on screen . nevertheless he's lovable as
the best movie that adam sandler has been in so far .
spectacular movie and the cinematography was worth seeing for . brad pitt has never looked as good he did in this , be still my heart !
stephen king and anthony hopkins waht else needs to be said . great movie
i was distresssed to see people on this comment board who didn't like the flying of characters . idea that martial artists can expand their ki (japanese name for energy ) or chi (chinese name) and achieve magical powers is a very old myth in asian literature film say they lee's movie because it included chinese legend are simply too ignorant know what , study gong americans be soooo quick judge other culture's traditions myths legends ! first amendment allows whatever want but doesn't protect rest us from saying don't based ignorance...
have to disagree with irish about this , but the portrayal was more accurate than he might know . blue paint a symbolic reference in homage their scottish ancestors  picts painted ones face only actually theatrical stripped naked and entire bodies blue....to appear fierce...an ancient attempt at psychological warefare
awesome movie!!! !
before i begin , if you don't like brad pitt and are going to mark this as not helpful  . then what the hell doing searching for material related him ? movie was great ! simply best it is long but when who cares another good love soundtrack well your reading this...(yeah right...) really he a actor hollywood needs his kind...
through its use of well defined characters , the color money allows viewers to peek into a world that is foreign most and humanizes these people who hustle or con their way life . written script hints at what hustler might be like : cold calculating indifferent anything except own desires audience sees how hustler's may exciting but mostly it's empty shallow because they always must keep guard up watch back
this movie is what every young boy wants to experience .
surprisingly frightening but the ending could have been re-worked .
a pleasant and welcome return of sam raimi to films dealing with the supernatural . this in my opinion was on best year blistering good performances from an all star ensemble cast , movie really packs heavy punch course cate blanchette steals show as always genious performance widowed mother three young boys southern alabama(i think) she makes money by giving people readings gives these using deck cards that have different symboles face side starts strange visions during day while sleeps there is some foul play going her little town film propleeled it's great uncanny ability keep story up speed thought provoking its beautiful directing true master includes such talents greg kinnear hillary swank katie holmes keanu reeves ( exibiting acting abilities must been hidden for years) second coming very under rated actor giovanni ribisi his captivating real well done naturalistic murder mystery/supernatural thriller highly recommended if you like brilliant telling making treat yourself sleeper
will did a great job . jammie 5 stars by this one
jude law is so fine ! i hope this brings him into contention for more high profile roles .
read the book it is even better .
having read and enjoyed four of patricia highsmith's five ripley novels , i don't at all agree the book is better than movie . in novel completely unbelievable -- he's an entertaining but totally artificial creation concocted from author's desire to make a philosophical point very believable film has depth because characters like real people have feelings too long cuts should been made first half not second as most seem think after aridity english patient minghella back deep probing heart he showed madly truly deeply
an outstanding movie with some of the best acting performances i have seen in years . russell crowe is actor his generation whenever see a , am always drawn into and soon forget i'm watching portraying role (as comparison if watch tom cruise never for second that it's on screen huge difference talent) this will go down as one boxing all time think crowe's greatest performance
all i have to say is that this film should won the best picture oscar !
crowe , zellwegger and the entire cast give outstanding performances in this film . it is an emotionally taxing story about a man sruggling to bring his family through great depression i guess i've never really seen that period time depicted so vividly like made me thankful for what have there are many sad parts didn't know when cry virtually nothing boxing but thought part of was very good howard easy ignorant understand how why fights happened way they did if you hate might get bit bored overall excellent excellently told acted as well
taliesin jones movie was a pleasant surprise ! i totally engrossed in the story line and acting convincing sincere deserves better publicity so that more people experience this journey of life from perspective heart child , real true full joy heartache,compasion,adventure surprises . like is but with also showing us path to hope great movie!!
fantastic movie!!! ! the storyline is very simple and lifelike it about a boy that questions life . an honest portrayal of young makes you think one best movies i have seen in long time
very clever movie with a killer ending !
aside from the rivaling band directors , cast was full of a bunch unknowns . i found film to be believable and it made my long for college days
drumline is an awesome movie . i saw it awile ago , so don't remember quite a bit of but from what was really good story
great cast . good story line , but a bit predictable surprised the two main characters didn't share same love interest very refreshing to see movie with predominantly black show something positive without violence drugs and sex there is no defeatist attitudes abounding in this it gives people chance wonderful paegentry of marching bands historically colleges universities
nick cannon did a very good job , and this was great movie . not sure why people don't like it
good movie...nick cannon was great for the part becuase it didnt take much talent to pull in off.gq(nick white friend jayson) probably funniest.had songs and greta beats but unlike music , story just flow
this sleeper hit breaks your heart , but not in the way you expect it to . stick with its conclusion and get guts twisted into a pretzel beautifully shot an excellent score fine cast good script bit frustrating anything that affects is cinema strongly recommended
what makes this movie excellent is not the landscape happy direction by sean penn , but rather sad and mellow performance jack nicholson who obviously always incredible . time however his worn tired look matched with obsessive tendencies he was at peace unrest in a way that many other actors are capable of i enjoyed somber film very much
oh , god i loved this movie was only twelve when saw it and wowed me just love sally feilds
i was so into the movie that when it ended wanted to have a sword fight and leap across rooftops .
this is one of the best romantic films all time . it's a tear-jerker and proves how unforgettable love
intense.... .
this movie appealed to my own gnostic beliefs , so naturally i give one the nod over passion (which was good in it's right.)
i will give this movie three stars , even though i've never seen it just for the fact that makes all of jeeebus loving psycho fundamentalists absolutely rabid .
jim carrey can act?? ? it's a miracle ! great film with excellent direction , and oscar-calibur performance by martin landau .
a great movie . johnny depps sexy and kate winslets great.
this was an excellent movie . it very empowering for women the fight scenes were awesome love story great i highly recommend to anyone
even if you find nudity to be offensive you'd still have admire this man's struggle for his right express himself . hate hustler or larry flynt admit that he has a point with sex vs war speech and how unfair it was single him little magazine out when others like playboy penthouse were perfectly legal
any film that supports the freedom of self expression and speech is way up in my book . people vs larry flint chronicles story hustler magazine creator publisher , starring a wonderfully talented cast including woody harrelson courtney love edward norton all turning very praise worthy performances awarded with several awards nominations this really makes out to be hero someone who stood for his rights what he believed light wanted smut market damn you if also manages tug on some heart strings as it follows declining health larry's wife aids virus powerful thought provoking proud an american well most us fight country
my favourite movie...kudos to keanu on an outstanding performance .
one of my favourite movies all time . god , if only there were more nelsons around
i think that the movie is really romantic . and it carries idea sometimes person can only achieve happiness when he stops caring about routine pay attention to more important things , like love of sara deaver has a mission every month she starts new relationship trying make better after one dumps him lives her own life keanu tries hold forever but doesnt know secret very sick(cancer) still wants be with take care cuz loves deeply want suffer because remember strong beautiful also madly so its story two people who are in each other sacrifice their for sake at times funny especially beginning didnt was bothering finally fell thats how you hit on guys told myself point made fall without being whore seducing happened naturally by end november became nelsons world couldnt live reeves charlize theron match together( devils advocate).ok if awake would say read this definitely dying boredom just give my strongest recommendations sweet worthy watching writing
i hate and mean golf but this movie was so not about . shocked that loved as much did watched one afternoon when had nothing better to do on after 10 minutes into the happy stuck with it robert redford once again made another great film , a cast!! !
a wonderful , dream like film . for an older woman it is such pleasure to find with all the greatness i remember from films studios beauty fun and touching love story subtitles did not bother me at loved had see again before went away have now purchased sound track book
wonderful ! i was emotionally enthralled from the beginning
cormac mccarthy's all the pretty horses was one of first books tackled by my book club . us , to a person were dismayed when finding out that matt damon going play john grady cole thinking him not much more than 21st century brat pack-er we ever wrong he did an incredible job in what i think is movie year billie bob thornton's direction marty stuart's music inspiring and three actors turned oscar caliber performances am few people who thought love story got just as attention it deserved would have hated see this turn into another prince tides  loved
wow ! fantastic matt damon , henry thomas and lucas black - acting ; marty stuart for the music especially billy bob thornton his direction should all be academy award winners this awe-inspiring tale .
billy bob should walk away with academy awards for this deeply moving , awe inspiring rendition of the book . many thanks an uplifting evening total entertainment
caught the movie last night . it seems that critics were right on only one thing - there wasn't enough development of cole's relationship with any ranch family was like watching an accelerated version book matt damon and henry thomas exceptional , whoever cast as captain bravo ! he gave me willies just in saw friends who hadn't read they really liked too..
i can't say this loud enough ignore the critics  . just remember most la and ny didn't want to be , they wanted actors their pissed off makes sense that would try keep public from seeing an intelligent creative movie like pretty horses it's a story about honor truth love friendship...good old american values without all in your face you must stupid so we will have spell it out for kind of violent grotesque crap hollywood puts everyday masses seem if you've seen enjoyed yourself then hooray you!!! ! pass on...ignore critics!!
this movie evoked in me powerful emotions i haven't felt about a long , while . damon's acting was superb up there with good will hunting and his on-screen relationship henry thomas made it evident the two are off-screen friends cinematography is comparable to horse whisperer broad sweeping 'drop-everything-and-go-there' beautiful truly full of passion speak not only romance which somewhat underplayed for role plays most found within john grady cole himself soul-searching self-inflicted guilt self-consciousness willingness do whatever (alejandra) says dynamics character very acurately portrayed however editing seems bit choppy--after saw thought several scenes could have been elaborated on come find out they were talk magazine december month he speaks 'the four-hour version' that version hands-down best he's ever just hope release because leaves both great satisfaction pride human spirit but also longing see more hear be these men....and unforgettable woman excellent
does any body think thet the director made it seem that main character matt damon died in mexican prison and rest of movie was what death like for him . because all through there were mentions weird things happened after he stabbed
i thought this movie was awesome ! definitly matt's best character . read the book and they are both great director did a job telling story
classic - watch it over on tape/dvd better than ratings support
i heard mixed reactions to this movie , but can honestly say that loved it ! also love football and a lot of the actors in put 2 together you've got great enternaining
one of the really good movies recent years. . nicolas cage in top form with an excellent supportive cast highly recommended
great movie , action shows the history !
lost highway is a film that all filmakers wish they could make . but sadly , most don't have the talent david lynch has in his pinky finger this dark noir masterpiece movie was made to open minds inspire thought and feeling it accomplishes very well every person who watches takes something different out of what i take life like going directions conclusions fred madison's guilt over killing wife (which he doesn't even remember..he sees himself brutally doing so on tape sent home.) overtakes him becomes someone else or at least halluncinates does two sides road redemption suffering release more than shows look beneath surface (much did blue velvet twin peaks) showed things aren't always as may seem beautfully with man black masterful party scene which aformentioned tells fred's home..when scoffs then told call home finds answering...this brilliant for many reasons..when first saw rewound watched again..just try fully comprehend lynch's work really isn't there be comprehended it's experienced felt elements are present taken understood upon repeat viewings..and considering how i've only seen twice i'm sure miss lot amazing amazing..everything he's ever done see
this film describes its tale in a slow manner , unbearably tense and unnerving first 45 mins . the rest of does get bent out shape due to complexity mystery lynch is real master at telling mysteries because he enjoys them so much
breathtaking !
i love eminem -- from his controversial lyrics to personal life . he is an awesome man who has brought himself up nothing something anyone disagrees just jealous made of because he's such rapper and now own record label !
lotto is the best rapper in tha movie
anyone who has rated this movie lower than a 4 is just jealous of eminem . i am not an fan , never have been stepped outside the box though and looked at from lovers stand point it great plot screams talent when he acting thought was gonna flop like fish boy ever wrong!! !
eminem was great as an actor i hope he pursues acting career even though said would not .
one of the best movies ever made and if you have any scottish heritage it will fill with a lot pride . battle scenes are i seen mel gibson did an excellent job before behind camera probably my favorite movie all time
this was great . a must go see acording to me i love the fighting want fight in trees and climb up walls is movie
i thought this movie was great especially the freestyles .
i think this was one of the greatest movies ever . it had a lot good messeges in eminem is definetly actor and hope to see him soon another movie
crouching tiger , hidden dragon is a feast for the human eyes . this movie of great stunning utter beauty i chairman yi-yi declare best 2000.isn't zhang ziyi and michelle yeoh sexy damn those you who dislike due to subtitles free china movement would like say reading liberates mind so go out read all can you'll be glad did tiger.. most have any has collection in their homes see it or buy when it's on video dvd year that's final
i just saw this movie and must say , while not perfect it was excellent . have noticed reviews in the politically correct media cut on rate low because shows first two years of american civil war from confederate point view is sad upsetting to hear so-called critics hop race bandwagon they think will grant them brownie points african-americans try making that film biased toward southern showed rebel soldiers going off saying were fighting for their homes jobs instead slavery now as a professional historian would ask these same use little common sense after deep unbiased thought does one really millions fought 250,000 died defending most poor farm boys who better than slaves themselves agree many leaders confederacy planters slave holders led south into reason majority soldiery invaded fact basically about stonewall jackson facinating man an oustanding hard hitting warrior his life along with lee's army northern virginia terrific story needs be told today's paranoid populace need understand it's big part our countries history modern america learn more campaigns by lee 1862 1863 when terrors union apparently even learned reminding
easily the best of john grisham adaptations .
this is more than just a movie . it's visual masterpiece the desert scenes are truly spectacular audience when i saw picture actually started to applaud shortly after film began one that must be seen on big screen have not been so moved by beauty of since david lean's lawrence arabia
ralph fiennes shows why he is the greatest actor of our generation . plays three characters from 3 generations same hungarian family all have compelling and engrossing stories that span major events twentieth century if you like historical dramas , definitely check this one out jennifer ehle william hurt also deliver great performances not a movie for children it rather long but well worth effort
guy throws his life away
maybe it's just me , but i found this film all in to be pretty much flawless . thought that josh hartnett was completely convincing his role as the insecure hugo who is jealous of star school's basketball team so he unleashes a plan ruin life from beginning wonderful plot unfolds and what follows an amazing story jealousy insecurity mind manipulation really can't say about julia stiles mekhi pfeiffer except they were ok definately stole show eyes darkened audience able sense wasn't there after listening him talk for few minutes ending will disappoint most watch not because it isn't well done its you would want espescially when caused by one sick teenager's insecurities truly could have been prevented (hartnett) master manipulater find several accomplices throughout including very person whose planning on ruining true tragedy rarely seen movie consisting call teen actors which compelling o  highly reccomended !
exhilarating entertainment , particularly the opening fight scene between two women on rooftop that took my breath away . it is a tossup this and gladiator as to which best picture of year has everything in -- action sequences never before put film love stories mysticism teen rebellion ang lee himself described sense sensibility with martial arts people don't realize brought together some greatest talent world michael yeoh who should have been nominated for an academy award chow yun fat are not only biggest stars asia but appeared big american studio movies man choreographed scenes called business his work matrix  what he done here goes way beyond all lines movie delivered mandarin had be learned from scratch by actors none whom knew language previously see believe
it was an interesting combo of war and love .
don't think that you won't enjoy this because it is one , a foreign film or two martial arts . ang lee the director of ice storm and ride with devil both high profile american movies he also wedding banquet/eat drink man woman/and pushing hands knows character action story cinematography crouching tiger chinese fairy tale come to life i loved will believe can fly
awesome sex scenes !
it was great . diane lane is a actress she did wonderful job
a truly moving film from beginning to end , the man without face is tale of deep bond between disturbed young boy and troubled disfigured recluse who cannot rid himself his past . mel gibson absolutely fantastic in role it speaks well him that he was able act so wonderfully direct at same time however stolen by performance fourteen year old nick stahl whom picked personally for my opinion couldn't have better kid i've written elsewhere on this site just how much potential i think has believe will go far hollywood movie itself had some moments espescially interesting watching both characters evolve form an unbreakable friendship chuck (nick stahl) manages see gibson's character really towards says can't your scars anymore chuck's quest knowledge brings unusual with we gradually open up little ending provided excellent conclusion wonderful highly reccomended- remind you value grace true
i thought it was such a great movie ! funny at times , but got cried like 4 wonderful and so sad
i'm not sure if everybody will love this movie , but i know did.. . watched it two times in days the second time paying a bit more attention to music and other details. btw : website is awesome ! you can even create your own trailer send copy of friends..
very disturbing .
my favorite movie ever . i would not subsitute it for the original because flair of music that was chosen and visuals are a big part why love this
i don't know why this film is so under rated by the viewers . maybe it's to complex find twist absolutely stellar and perticularlly like tom cruise
beautiful and different
on my top five of 2001 list . vanilla sky is a dizzying brilliant film from cameron crowe you wouldn't expect like this coming , which makes it all the more cool to experience strange mind bending tripinto seemingly charmed life young owner magazine publishing company going well until he bumps and grinds wrong blonde what happens next an unstoppable rollercoaster into bizarre incredibly beautiful surreal fantastic visionary perfected will blow your right out head tom cruise penelope cruz diaz,kurt russel jason lee put in commendable performances diaz sticks most as obsessive psycho girl banged four times one night creepy hell somewhat reminds me few ex's pure masterpiece has made work art highly recommended absolutly astonishing
have to give it a 5 due the acting . parts of storyline were not great , but how can you love ellen burstyn sandra bullock maggie smith etc. ? well worth watching
a great movie with fantastic cast . very funny lines almost any ellen burstyn is
hilariously funny film is really carried by maggie smith and ellen burnstyn who give fine comic performances .
what a gorgeous movie-chow-yun fat is so captivating-the best film of the year , possibly. .
although this movie had a lot of language and people may not agree with that i feel overall the was just life . know many have similar experiences portrayed how we really act in our true lives felt actors made you as if were situations them they werent acting at all ! recommend 100% to anyone wants see can relate beware there is adult talk scenes but truth are
i went to go see this with a very good friend of mine and we both loved it . unfortunately missed the beginning - but what saw , simplicity plot since was just four main characters film is simplistic there are no huge surprises its quite realistic in terms emotion not happens real life certainly struck chord me little simple striking
closer is so honest that you might find yourself cringing . this the kind of honesty absolutely necessary for a movie dealing with sex , love and betrayal without it these themes will not connect to viewer settle into fantasy if like stay up late reading romance novels don't go see
this is the first movie that i've seen since american beauty truly original and captivating . it's one of few rare films actually copies no other ; watching it , you definitely will not feel as if you've already several times before...just with different actors there was dull moment to
it all depends on your style of movies wether you like this movie or not . but what can be argued is that flawless in every aspect the acting was great and directing couldn't better crouching tiger , hidden dragon has many scenes which would only see comic books such as fighting tree limbs flying off rooftops running up walls wasn,t done with phony graphics real cheesy attacks grace very well despite others say about should nominated for best year
larger than life comic book heroes usually don't come out as good jones but harrison ford gives him a real rugged and intelligent demeanor . he manages some of the most daring at times comical action ever filmed best scene : shooting swordsman in market place after swordsman's impressive display swordsmanship
this movie is based on a simply delightful , complex book and considering the difficult story it had did very well . kate hudson naomi watts shine as sisters roxy isabel their presence screen fantastic fox searchlight film essentially foreign which threw off audiences who hadn't read dealing with plenty of mini-plots it's smart enjoyable
one of my favourite films ever ! everything about it is brilliant , from the acting directing casting to plot humour and look/feel film . christian bale perfect as pat bateman he genuinely intense powerful (physically mentally) througout fact that i love all things new york 80s was pretty convenient in this soundtrack great with huey lewis phil collins fitting well contrasting against violence being portrayed for example played while axe-murders a colleague idea everyone on wall street at time anonymous clever such mistaken other people by his own colleagues displacement identity foremost theme here due commercialism vanity easton ellis' book brilliantly written extremely graphic (in both good e.g knowledge hit records released bad ways killing prostitute) although film's locations settings direction are needed complete look story fantastic
this is one of the funniest movies 2000 ! some may not catch on to humor at first but when you do it a laugh riot . and for god's sake killing point film it's comedy....a dark comedy
i don't understand how people could not like this movie.people look too hard to find some deep meaning , but there is none . its just a morbid comical at 80's yuppie lifestyles movie hilarious.christian bale was the perfect person cast for highly recomend that you see with your friends guarantee will laugh asses off
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie - in large part because of its uniqueness . have not had the opportunity to see a lot films from martial arts genre , and admit was expecting depth that delivered cinematography amazing gravity defying fight scenes were possibly best ever seen characters compelling delivers comedy romance action very non-traditional way don't think you will be disappointed
i thought that this movie was excellent . able to follow everything happened a little sad they didnt use the part with rat from book it awsome and will see again
i think people went to see this movie expecting too much . is not ment be deep in any respect it a funny warped look at the 80's yuppie life style found well made masterpeice of strange and macabre was interesting how greed materialism can make you completely disconnected from those around point homicide film taken as very dark tounge cheek comedy thought threesome scene with sussudio playing background classic my friends laughed about that all night day great source amusement an inside joke if succeds showing depths shallowness are am fan book even greater christian bale perfect for role did masterful job what he highly recommend its brilliant humor deffinatly taste morbid
it's great movie . one of the few movies to do justice that time in history , wether you agree with beatty's veiw or not real characters had a effect on american culture and way we think don't today
weaving brief , actual interviews with contemporaneous personalities intermittently into the story line was a very creative and useful inovation . one of all time greats
portrays the soviet union military in action of emergency incidents . excellent characters i rate it high as a drama movie and realistic portraying
my partner and i are huge fans of kevin spacey decided to rent this out one night - i'm really happy that we did . an interesting take on capital punishment the little tasters twists dished throughout film brilliant full suspense acting by kate winslet
the life of david gale is a powerful drama revolving around controversial issue capital punishment . story revolves (kevin spacey) , an opponent death penalty who soon finds himself on row for murder one his closest friends kate winslet plays reporter in film hired to interview four days before execution and herself believing gale's sets out find truth what follows suspenseful race against time as viewer unsure just winslet's character will if she it save some interesting twists turns surprising ending performances by all involved makes decent was highly that explored possibility error system i think proves its point quite well regardless your opinion this indeed with message captures viewer's attention throughout
even though i beleive this movie is a 4 , give it five to balance out those who disliked thus bolstering the grade little bit . :) thought was fairly interesting concept that somewhat predictable liked idea would prove innocent men and women get put death each year by state how really doesn't matter are in charge there many anarchist measages which found pleasing (by mean real not stuff like scare kids with) most people don't think picked up on as well enough with praise now for what didn't kate seemed breka into tears every few seconds first time understandable character of david gale started off some one you could almost but then he slips blandhood means end care happens him chalk bad writting because kevin does good job trying save heart
this movie is hard for people to understand the moral that paradise does not exsit no where u go has a nice storyline and gives out good vibe .
great movie up there with fight club , momento and identity . i loved it
the more you watch this movie better it gets . starts out as a two-star but is elevated with hidden details , visual and audio stimulation along desire to stumble upon paradise such
leonardo dicaprio was so0o0o0 hot in it!!! ! sexy mama i love richard 4 lyf!!!!
best movie i've seen in a while . gripping story , beautifully shot and directed the acting is superb fight scenes are magical every sense there's so much depth to this film it's hard know where start -- far more than just martial arts though part of it pretty fantastic
one of the most under rated movies all time- jack nicholson gives his greatest performance ever . highly recommend you see this
another misunderstood kubrick film that will soon be considered a masterwork . the same thing happened to 2001 , clockwork orange barry lyndon and shining--those viewers who didn't get it watch again took me two viewings understand what this is saying simply was unable make bad or dull
it's stanley kubrik's best film
i've gotta admit i thought this film was good , not the story just way it filmed - style . didn't know people could make films like anymore and only stanley kubrck have made a in 1999 ! another strange fact : it's completely england though set new york shots of real city were via second unit
this must be the best movie of 90's . from scene when doctor and his wife are at mansion lights glistening , to cruise walking streets or he is trying discover what happening whole film a visual treat ok last could ditched simply leaves tired ending but apart that cannot faulted
i've heard comments from people who said this is a bad movie because there was no chemistry between tom cruise and nicole kidman , i'd like to say them that's the whole point . if kidman's characters were happy enough or satisfied with their relationship do you think they would have fantasized about having affairs ? no!! ! then mean nothing be little open-minded folks also film written produced directed by late great stanley kubrick show it some respect
this is such a good movie ! all the actors play very well , especially tom cruise i love dramatic feeling film gave me in that sense similar to american beauty if you don't know what do tonight : go see excellent :-)
a saw this movie with few guys and girls we all liked it . that's hard to accomplish
it's a thriller with beautiful actors and actresses . it will keep your eyes on the screen all time plot of this movie is little bit weird
a lot of people didn't like this film . i did because thought it was good way to portray what cheating and lying really is , depends on the person their point view
scotish , i guess its cool to be nowa days . drop your kilt and play with fire kill !
everytime i watch this movie,i simply can't take my eyes of the screen.i am completely hooked.tom sizemore has , in opinion,the best performance film.love war movies,and one is movies.brilliant .
this is one of stanley kubrick's best films . a sexy mystery/thriller that keeps you thinking tom cruise and nicole kidman work perfectly together it's an enthusiastic film doesn't have to move fast hold your interest
one of my favorite films . this is truly a haunting masterpiece kubrick ended his career triumphantly i think it intense and dreamlike , liked the use unique lighting movie was exceptionally unsettling direction setting although slowly paced
the greatest war film made ever!! ! shot choppedand scored perfectly gritty and realistic , brings you into boots of soldiers . one my top five favorate movies all time
dark , existential and very nihilistic . ewan mcgregor showing again that he plays darker roles far better playing a drifter called joe who lives on glasgow barge with an older couple goes nonchalantly from one inapproprate sexual relationship to another causing emotional distress in the process seemingly feeling guilty yet unable take responsibility for behaviour his own insecurities have driven him this film has been dubbed 'last tango glasgow' due its intensity which is usually barely simmering below surface like last paris depends heavily chemistry although by comparison latter more tender custard scene young adam acquired certain kudos all of it's rightly so reminiscent (without being too explicit) after watching it i was asking myself question she consenting or not ? some way defines these women never reject weakness thier part overall challenging gives you plenty think about both morally emotionally but probably good watch if you've just dumped were looking feel movie !
great movie . it is abit brutal and depressing though
chick flick was kinda kool
an amazing film ,ridly is a master
i expected a sappy , predictable emotion-manipulating movie.instead found myself languidly moving through story that was romantic without trying to play with the audience's emotions . perhaps charlotte little too playful be credible when she told will about her illness after their 1st night together but then again young people are known for denying own mortality regardless of facts loved supporting characters lack smugness and glibness general humanity in hospital scene near end dolly doesn't allow herself denied grief it really broke hollywood formula character resolution 'niceness' face tragedy there were no cheap tricks felt hollow at life's just like well done joan !
great movie
an interesting subject , a good story great director and wonderfull melody . but over all magic couple - barbra streisand robert redford
im the first to vote
to all the soldiers of task force ranger in somalia , delta troops sfc randy shuggart and msgt gary gordon . this was a very well put together movie it is my time fav men that fought died deserve be imortalized for what they did man next them *salute*
such a great feel-good movie . it made me happy to be woman today , and not 50 years ago my advice rent with your mom will make you both smile
people have completely disregarded the very essence of what this movie is actually trying to capture . its looking at satirical , indirect negative double-standard downfall industry ethnic minorities or even as a whole are quick pidgeon-hole point finger for many outcomes yet still their celebrated in sports and media big wig companies jump immediately promote products (nike adidas reebok coca cola business cards etc) me thats just double-standards if we look programmes like eastenders instance not east london i know booming with asians gays blacks you name it why these parts so badly represented stereotyped portrayed worse all? ? black face was extremely offensive but exactly spike lee wanted viewer think about when guys performed tv show that directors such oliver stone michael moore mel gibson take risks give audiences something film would be terribly boring place indeed
a really sad and scary movie . just thinking what it was like for those soldiers terrifying considering the fact this true story
spike lee is a brave man . it will take intelligence for people to understand and appreciate this movie
this may sound weird , but movie made me fall in love . and it is a good
this movie is one of the most powerful , moving films ever made . fact that it was real really happened to americans truly heartbreaking i can't imagine horror they went through *very* graphic in parts just thinking about guy loses entire bottom half his body who thumb or picked up hand and stuck pocket  .it gives me chills makes my stomach turn think actors all worked well together ending could have been a bit better -- kind leaves you hanging fills on what text would liked see when mike set free from imprisonment by militia very tear-jerker
i think this is the imax movie,so maybe it should be put in there,cuz it's not a drama,it's about extreme sports
stupid but bs is so hot id like to suck her titties
i liked it for some odd reason .
great
this movie was one of the best war movies ever made . i dont know what people are talking about having no story line or not feeling character  is a happy joy , its real men who went into middle warzone and died for somthing they thought right if you want stick to your disney
i love to dance and found this movie very good at showing the effort learn . also really have wanted see an actually take of a cuban mambo im not quite sure it was entirely correct but pretty close
i liked it and can't understand why this movie is at the bottom of list . actors were great had quite a fascinating cast setting in dallas was interesting there some funny light moments richard gere always
finally , a war movie that isn't based on vietnam and back . this has the usual flash camera gloss jerry bruckheimer brings to all his films however appears have credable acting by cast thanks vision of acclaimed director ridely scott is not for weak at heart no gory detail was left out then again whoever said supposed be glamorous pretty if anyone still holds opinion will make them change their minds
i liked it . was very true to what really happened , and showed is like that not all military cuss a whole lot (they did though) they dont sit look at seedy pictures the time
bad ass movie ! great acting and storyline . good
this movie has everything you could want from a . drama ; comedy fight-scenes even little romance is long but to me it serves purpose good introduction medieval japan reveals the interrelationship between two different social classes , farmers and samurai are fascinating i wouldn't have minded if their characters wear explored bit more know about silent masterswordsman kyuzo oh well an excellent story it's told in way that makes enjoyable watch again there can only be one best of all time why not ?
this film is kurosawa's masterpiece . it's even better than his 1985 movie , "ran."
the greatest movie i've ever seen . ah , some people just don't appreciate great films...
a magnificent cinematic achievement . for those who find it too long or have trouble reading the subtitles , i recommend watching u.s remake seven day before plots are similar enough and kurosawas direction casts acting is so good that if you difficulty with won't lose track
hey , im only 15 and i think seven samurai is the best film ever . wish more people my age would watch it hate for this to be dubbed take all its charm away everyone should stop whining about how long much reading there first of fit that great story into a movie has second if you dont like bad probly need read anyways give an a+ go ahead find better foriegn dare you..
best movie ever made . direction- perfect acting- music- great action , comradery first 10 minutes after intermission are my fav ten in cinema good introduction to foreign films wish kurosawa was still alive making movies
even at 3 hours long,this celebrated adventure,in which the eponymous warriors defend a village from bandits,is probably perfect introduction to foreign language films;the characters superbly drawn and acted(mifune shimura outstanding),the pacing masterly,the story itself never less than fully involving,the editing choreography in extended final battle scenes superlative.there's touch of romantic lyricism thrown for good measure.for once critics public are united their admiration- kurosawa's all-time top 10 masterpiece .
akira kurosawa wanted to make a film that was , in his words good enough eat . he certainly accomplished this because seven samurai is one of the most entertaining movies ever made if not movie all-time ! it's all there technical mastery steelar performances shimura and mifune.....there too much say so i can't possibly display my affections for it two small paragraphs greatness beyond
by god i love this movie . mafuni is great a better hard to find
who keeps giving these movies 1's and 2's?? ? there are very few films that surpass seven samurai , in the entire history of filmmaking . it is surely kurosawa's best (ok so maybe not ; rashomon pretty spectacular as well) puts to shame overhyped american classics like gone with wind a streetcar named desire watch ! all other great foreign if you don't you're missing out on treasure trove genius
akira kurosawa's seven samurai is an inspired epic , a triumph of art and unforgettable three-hour ride i will never forget . it one the greatest films ever made by any director have movie on dvd watch once every month found love more then this must in your collection
wonderful film that captured my imagination as a child and still today brilliant student of .
good movie . i enjoyed it suprisingly
what else can i say that hasnt been said . a truly beautiful film
perfect .
an excellent film about a boy's lifelong friendship with man who runs the cinema in his small hometown . ending almost made me cry , and i never at movies
as dr . no is the first james bond film (released in 1962) and was largely responsible for ultimate success of series , movie would merit five starts on that basis alone course deserves a high rating its well establishes much 007's persona which lasted throughout tough smart suave witty second set relatively exotic locale (ie jamaica) uses local music some viewers this their exposure to type island (eg ska calypso) third plot strong but not overly reliant action (which has plagued more recent films series) fourth includes hi-tech aspects (remember it with nuclear power rockets mechanical dragon part story became staple fifth icing cake boasts one best girls form ursula andress honey ryder (setting yet another trend intriguing names features felix leiter played by jack lord (it's shame did reprise role latter films.) finally roles both m (bernard lee) miss moneypenny (lois maxwell) are introduced established 007 an artistic note differs from other viewer does ever see bond's primary nemesis until near end plays already mysterious nature man named builds suspense gets impression just hiding his lair merely waiting ensnare when time comes tactic appears again you only live twice (1967) diamonds forever (1971) less effect
this is on my top 10 list .
one of my favorite movies . truly romantic in the larger sense word beautifully written , filmed and directed
a side of peter lorre's performing skills you must see . he portrays an out control child killer heavy for 1938 movie , but crime drama
i love this movie . it wasn't an easy film to get into at first , but was soon hooked and have loved ever since tried show other people they ended up falling asleep while riveted my seat watching peter lorre in his brilliant performance the that both made him broke as actor established a great gave evil creepy bad guy character type he never able fully break away from
awesome movie . even in subtitled form it is powerful and provocative i wish understood portugese to get the full effect ! two thumbs up
a great recent foreign movie .
great movie . very good story shows harsh reality in the ghettos of rio
don't ever go swimming in the reactor if you have metal hands .
kurosawa's adaptation of king lear is a beautiful , if trifle long work art . i wouldn't put it at the peak his craft but excellent
one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever made . gorgeous to look at
words cannot express how good this film really is . see it and observe brilliance
awesome movie . i really wanted saburo to live though maybe its better that he didnt suggest it for the foriegn fan
kurosawa is one of the greatest and this full-color spectacular will blow you away !
i love roberto benigni ! think he is so funny . am sure some people find him too hyperactive but do not mind it might take a few minutes to get use his style the plot : jewish man falls for beautiful woman nicoletta braschi using humour captures her heart , of son and movie viewer you truly see how power hope exists during most trying conditions in nazi concentration camps that will stay with if like benigni. also liked johnny stecchino
one of the few foreign movies i have seen only . hate having to try and follow actions in movie read subtitles other than that , this was a great really enjoyed it both drama history
beautiful movie
i wish could give it more stars ! this movie is perfect . cried , laughed a classic.life beautiful@
i've never really liked having to read my movie as i'm watching it -- in other words , following subtitles . but this was different somehow the father worked so hard protect his son from horrors of war and genocide keep son's innocence love (and possibly trust) for humanity some parts were funny that almost painful laugh because they also made me cry ; i basically laughing through tears film heartbreaking true uplifting beautiful especially end after trembling head toe didn't know whether or amazing !
the best holocaust movie.begnini deserved oscar .
life is beautiful a very well done film and deals with the difficult topic of hitler's genocide attempt upon jews . it was made wisdom portrayed believable characters effectively showed love father for his son i am amazed at how this juxtapostition being humorous in darkest situations great movie that touches heart !
just an astounding movie.....incredible acting , heart breaking story !
this would be my number one reason for learning italian , to fully understand every single word that comes from his (robert's) mouth . not many movies will make me cry but did i cant anymore after seeing it 25 plus times i'm equally moved time its fair divided the movie into 2 chapters first is guido (roberto ) winning love second chapter about roberto trying protect son horror of ww2 much more a tale life simply irresistible appetite astonishing breathtaking overall acting all characters are superb and music melt in maybe greatest ever darn close ! 5 stars
a wonderful movie . it really has two plots in one roberto benigni{sp?} is terrific as jewish man who the first half of fall love and pursues woman dreams.the tactics he takes to win her over are funny romantic coming classroom pretending be an inspector , following theater taking for ride etc meanwhile horror holocaust closing on them getting worse second when they married have adorable five year old boy robertos character his wife son taken concentration camp dad together keep joshua from horrors what going invents game tank.this some comedy but shows sacrifice makes get him through this horrific experience
one of the greats.hugely entertaining and poiniant.the battle scenes are unrivaled .
from the first scene you know who is punished for murder of his wife . film gets stars being unconventional it follows leonard , a former insurance agent around l.a he's convinced wifes murderer still and he must find him only problem can't remember anything so tattoo clues on body keep very meticulous methods to forgetting goal revenge movie works backwards like balled up newspaper ; once peel open start get whole story great performances by guy pierce carrie-anne moss see this twice
no , what say the title or name . well this movie is as : lat us make things better with a smile resultq human being respectfullity for mother earth let life that's so beautiful not ? franscis
what i cannot believe is that this just getting rated . excellent film has been out now for over 2 years as a father you should see and all of its passion roberto bernini put into it can even rarity on man his real life wife acting together passionate off the silver screen will make cry (provided have heart)
this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen . set around most horific tragedy in history , it a love story first between man and woman then his son so many scenes tug at your heart while you're also laughing with sub-titles may difficult to follow on small screen but definitely worth effort
i broke two of my movie rules (no subtitles/no movies about the holocaust) in order to see life is beautiful , and i'm really glad did . it's a phenomenal film ! show man who tries make bearable for his young son after they've been sent concentration camp though extremely sad many ways also incredibly uplifting heartwarming even hilarious at times acting superb across board roberto benigni shines oscar-winning performance if you're avoiding because subtitles don't let that keep you from seeing it was so drawn very start didn't realize reading them as someone has tried twice through schindler's list failed can guarantee portrayal holocaust not too graphic must
i saw this in the cinema and could not leave my seat for a while . all do was try to get over sobbing , say wow that best movie i've seen long time people it took holocaust made light of disagree think film about love--not rjust romantic love--the greater sense word how love can endure even most horrific situations
this is the most fantastic movie i've seen in a long , time . it's got few laugh out loud parts and an incredible tearful ending its interesting whole way throuhg i can't recommend more strongly
i m definitely not a big fan of foreign cinema , but life is beautiful something special . this one those rare movies that s almost perfectly put together every single scene an integral part the overall movie story incredibly moving and roberto benigni's performance was truly worthy oscar he won it impossible to get attached his character guido father who relies on amazing imagination prevent son from suffering while they are prisoners in nazi concentration camp would have thought someone could make funny about holocaust never once detracting seriousness tragedy ?
forget schindler's list : this is much better ! best film of '98 non-english ever :o) ps do anyone know why la vita bella wasn't nominated for one single golden globe , when it was seven oscars won three?! ?
i laughed ! cried...hysterically
probably the best and most engrossing film about ww2 ever made . you actually start to sympathise with crew of what is after all a german u-boat
one of the cinematic masterpieces , both on technical merit and for raw emotion poured into story . a must see
a work of genius . dark , claustrophobic oppressive and unnerving film that is one the best pictures men at war ever made
it's not easy to think of a better war movie.not only are the attempts finish sub off very realistic,but movie did terrific job establishing captain as soldiers divorced from their fellow german criminals .
everytime it's ontv i have to watch it . really immerses you into the lives and minds of submariners third reich feels very realistic a simple story skillfully delivered
a near perfect film .  .you actually feel squeezed in the submarine with sailors director's cut is long and requires an attention span brain- if you have short then don't bother das boot greatest most realistic sub movie ever book even better
this is on my top 10 list .
this was a great movie . one of the few movies that captures deutsche experience in world war two , showing most germans went to for same reasons americans ans brits war, : serve their country
excellent moive . completely evokes the claustrophobia and spiritual dilema of these men their situation
c'est bon !
one of the best movies i have ever seen . beautiful to watch humorous details throughout yet has a serious story -- search for one's life meaning told metaphorically and directly , with humor pathos even an element suspense/mystery all characters are well-developed fun different lines keep engaged highly recommend this uplifting movie when saw it in theater whole place was laughing often (warning : is adult french)
this is a great , fun movie . period
audrey tatou is practically edible in this film . it's about a whole lot of somethings/nothings (mostly amelie's head) great use voiceover narrative as comedic device--the main character has minimal dialogue yet her expressions married with the lead to outrageous laughter cute love story and lawn gnome ! lol!!
beautifully filmed . (i love what they do with the colors!) interesting characters , and a very cute storyline i it !
okay , not exactly heavy on story line but the film making is amazing ! god in details!
best film released in the states 2001 .
a truly passionate and beautifully done film about woman trying to help others by sacrificing her own needs going out of way do it . amelie is unique character , with quirks flaws trademarks she's had hard life mother was killed in front she give away pet goldfish at such young age under brutal enforcement but finds joy every little thing uplifting
this is probably one of the best french movies done in a long time . it's about impish-looking little waitress who does something very kind for someone and then infected by feeling decides to do more good thing others she also seeks love some stranger , that sublot creatively woven into fabric movie equally entertaining funny comforts soul
an intriguing plot and very , cleverly done . guy pearce really has shown time again that he is a good actor since leaving 'neighbours' back in the early 90's it interweaves cutting forward from different characters perspectives perfectly makes intense viewing
audrey tatou is amazing . truly heartwarming
this movie was something of a surprise to me.most french films that i had seen until now were boring as hell! ! but one is the opposite . amelie breath fresh air makes you feel amazinlgy good - left theather in such mood has it not happened long time wonderful film,very well directed , with an amazing cast audrey tatou fabulous and soundtrack cannot be described have listen cd!
i love this film so much . it is quite possibly my fave ever words cannot express how great just watch , now go on
this is said to be the best french movie ever produced , and i don't doubt it a sec ! it's fabulous gives you such good feeling although amelie doesn't only do things...but we forget 'cause other people (the ones she treat very well) are bad themselves . that discribes perfect society exist anywhere which wount realized ever.. i'm not so sure about what film creativity actions done by heart know think commenting saying unrealistic say they feel would never able live up ideals of but blame audience for many as in take gandhi an example like recommend entire world go nearest cinema see beautiful actually better than la vita e bella (life beautiful) american beauty psycho can why has become integrated part president eleccion campaign.. it'll paralize me if turns out win oscar foreign year :-)
this is absolutely one of the best movies i have ever seen . moving scenes are not just love , but as each characters plys his trade barrault a genius was debureau in day transformations he performs onscreen masterful
this grand,lavish,romantic costume drama,called by some france's answer to gone with the wind,and voted french academy their country's greatest film,is a magnificent evocation of theatre and teeming street life in 1830's paris.revolving round beautiful,enigmatic courtesan(arletty,in her defining role),a ruthless criminal,a soft-hearted mime artist romantic stage actor,the film's cast,art direction intertwining different plot strands are superlative.while arletty's independent spirit was taken represent nazi-occupied france itself (an allegory which passed unnoticed german censors),the film is glorious indulgence visual feast .
beautiful film .
a remarkable film .
powerful , dark intense and richly metaphoric ; it is still one of my favorite films all time but i have to be in the mood . not suited for typical american taste since requires attention thought patience a bit education doesn't hurt know about european history read kierkegaard either
it s one hell of a movie . these things aren t made today and that shame
this is , for me the movie which defines pedro almodovar's style . i don't think atame and tacones reach level of frenetic comedy enjoy ride eat gazpacho !
one of almodovar's best and the funniest movies ever made . carmen maura is outstanding as harried much put-upon protagonist
this movie is trademark almodocar . crazy , distrubing touching but hilarious including almovodar regularas like carmen maura and a 20 something antonio banderas about women on the verge.....and in love while basis of story line isn't original (a woman getting dear johned by her lover for someone else (ironically she was other with guy too.) how reacts to it steps takes finally confront him are what that where things get first almodovar i'd ever seen i became instant fan
what can i say about this movie that hasn't been said already ? it's an absolutely brilliant film , and everyone took a part in making it should be praised applauded .
good film that illustrates morality and faith . should be seen by any christian who likes foreign cinema
an exquisite film . complex simplicity
touching in its simplicity . a must
one of the all time greats ! bicycle thief is a film you simply cannot help but enjoy , even if you're afraid subtitles . visuals are poignant poetic and touching picture also neorealism's crowning achievements (and certainly desica's finest work) anything less than 5 stars would be sin
an incredible and extremely important film in a number of ways . it is one the few pieces state funded cinematic propoganda which actually entertaining makes use several (at time) innovative cinemagraphic techniques , most are common today execution mutineers odessa steps massacre sequences spectacular
this movie really is incredible . i've watched it a few times and i'm finally making sense of goes backwards cuts in out , keeping the viewer guessing second-guessing whole time guy pearce almost endearing as leonard he struggles to remember his past make peace with future moments where people take advantage disability are heart-breaking i reviewed for psychology class once when we were focusing on memory got my interested seeing fast-paced violent mysterious intriguing definitely recommend conversation-piece but try watch more than pick up subleties that you might have missed first around !
eisenstein's legendary silent milestone- possibly the single most important and influential film in development of cinema as an art form.depicting 1905 mutiny by a disgruntled battleship crew,joined revolt civilian populace against brutal tsarist regime,the goes far beyond political propaganda.with its masterful symphonic structure,prodigious choreography above all dynamic suitably revolutionary montage editing (peaking celebrated odessa steps sequence)it remains highly impressive accomplishment . strike (brilliant also) , october  alexander nevsky (stunning black white cinematography) ivan terrible 1 2 (daring,operatic style) are other eisenstein classics worth seeing
in a massive,futuristic,mechanised city,down-trodden underground workers are led to revolt by malign female robot.metropolis happens have been,reputedly,hitler's favourite film!don't be deterred;after he came power,the director fritz lang had the good sense leave germany.of all great silents , for me,it ranks second only murnau's sublime sunrise .with its quite staggering monumental set designs,inspired special effects and seemingly ceaseless invention,it still stands not as revered (gothic expressionist)sci-fi classic,but true work of genius .
the perennial runner-up to citizen kane (and occasional #1) in major international polls,and greatest masterpiece of jean renoir,surpassing work his father painter.an aviator hero love with a countess is invited her lavish weekend party at country chateau- cue for wonderful blend comedy,drama and tragedy.initially banned when released on eve world war 2(for its unpopular but insightful observations french society),it overflows director's trademark humanity,wisdom,intelligent dialogue cinematic expertise.the camerawork coordination movement are quietly astounding.renoir was undoubtedly one handful finest directors,revered by peers critics alike.his la grande illusion an established anti-war classic , boudu saved from drowning exceptionally witty lyrical social study,but my favourite miniature gem partie de campagne / day  .
what an amazing film ! the first time i saw this , thought it was far too long and heavy on dialogue . after revisiting in my mind however soon dawned me exactly how remarkable renoir's vision here rules of game is a masterpiece perhaps second only to citizen kane pantheon cinema giants
great movie . very inspirational for girls who want to go against the grain performances by lead girl , grandmother and grandfather was nominated an oscar
a man is on his way to daughter's birthday when he abducted . while held captive , framed for wife's murder released after 15 years in captivity then goes mission find out why was finds the person responsible captor says did i release you ? one of cruelest movies have ever seen great movie
this is a pretty cool movie about desperation and the what ifs  . it's very fast-paced , fun to watch ; animation still-shot series mix well with mood of film pounding techno beat definately raises intensity if you don't mind subtitles
this was one of the most imagineative movies i have ever seen . storyline and plot were very exciting kept me interested for whole movie.i liked fact that you could see how life be affected so much just by making a decision way or other no matter small may seem acting cast best if haven't run lola , rent it buy steal wont dissapointed
run lola is a fast moving train ride set in with great dance music . i enjoyed this movie and nearly wanted to join the running have my collection for people who dislike reading subtitles of any foreign watch country , it doesn't matter where (japan china south africa vietnam.)and see how much good like can be don't mind because words chairman yi-yi liberates if haven't seen
this movie has made film noir hip again , plus it a cleverly woven storyline . guy pierce shines in film! !
absolutely fantastic . i studied media at college and developed a taste for foreign films had read the critics reviews it was outstanding so went to cinema watched totally grabbed my attention due camerawork style part love best is where she runs past particular people you see snapshots of what happen them in future changes with every senario that happens lola now have film on dvd highly recommend
a fast paced movie . it reminds me of groundhog day with bill murray , always repeating itself until things are done right the only drawback is in german english subtitles
a style of movie you've never seen before . run lola is german as twisted and crazy it can be the story one dude , dying retrying defying laws nature reacting similar situations keep you glued to screen not missed !
great movie with no real drawbacks . even the subtitles weren't a problem i was surprised by this in that it good
i thought this movie was great . it really different the music good there isn't much dialogue but visual aspect of makes story and since has subtitles , helps shows what if like when you have to do something don't always wonder 'what if?' well takes 3 possible senarios happens is fascinating loved
this is one of the most inventive and just awesome movie ever ! i got special edition dvd watched it chronological way , which was really cool if you can't figure out how go to eeggs.com .
one of the most original movies to come around in along time . it drives home how bankrupt hollywood is when comes originality and creativity
run lola is fun to watch but you should do so with a rewind button ready - several clips are flashes of scenes in row that go fast meant only get the gist events . fantasy original and film techniques mostly support overall mood i didn't especially like cartoon sequences interspersed (about 3 total) movie , they weren't horrible
probably the best vampire movie ever , and high up there in pantheon of my personal favorites . no actor has essayed a more terrifying repellent than max schreck all movies that have been produced decades since are just pallid imitations this masterpiece passage time done nothing to minimize its chilling potency even re-make by genius film-maker werner herzog couldn't measure
max schreck portrays the creepiest character to ever grace screen .
one of the great silent films all time , and best most intelligent horror as well . i particularly like scene rats biting sailors
this is truely a great slient horror flim! ! max schreck wonderful as count orlock it's my favorite flim noseratu recommended for people who want to see good film the best version don't be fooled by any cheap remakes! original best! remember go with 1922 version!! you'll never regret watching masterpiece!
the most atmospheric and eerie movie about undead , vampire it only gets more powerful with age .
possibly the most frightening horror movie of all-time ! murnau sure as hell knew how to make movies , did germany in general they set ground-work for on a successful .
probably the best rendition of immortal novel . maurnau is a great director , and nosferatu proves it this film set standard for every gothic horror that followed along with phantom opera cabinet dr caligari silent movie
great movie . one that makes you think both as the goes on and after its over lose if miss a minute definitely worth seeeing
2 children from a swedish acting family have to live with cruel stepfather,a religious minister , when their father dies.if this plot outline sounds like the great director ingmar bergman's trademark nordic gloom,think again;his masterful final(multi-oscar winning)film is real heart warmer,full of joyful spirit,much it centring on christmas celebrations.a grand,fitting monument celebrated career;glowingly photographed,shot through humanity and even sprinkled little magic !
this movie is clear magic , and the director ingmar bergman a creator of real . i loved way music slowly just poors throughout story how he explains carachters to gently love ! it s so fasinating see they make swedish christmas alive janey_lane you re right if not over trhe record haven t broke go girl
something that has ticked me off since oscar nigth though is all i hear crouching tiger , hidden dragon the record for most wins a foreign language film . wrong!! ! fanny and alexander also won four oscars tiger.. didn't win five their 'record' doesn't exist still hold that's
if you like food and simple stories without cheap tricks then this would be film to watch . a culinary delight
this is the way food supposed to be done . like water for chocolate could learn something here
one of my favorites . a movie about what's really worthwhile in all our lives without ever getting preachy or heavy-handed wonderful
this is a brilliant movie , both in direction and artistic value . it shows how art can be the ultimate gift of oneself knows no boundaries - culturally religiously or socially
one of the best movies year .
great movie for kids . some younger might be scared by of the images but worth watching other from maker 'princess mononoke' he is good at making movies about courageous young girls that are viewing all
i love this movie it's an awesome .
it's extremely awesome ! comedy and adventure all in one .
this has to easily be the best cartoon i have ever seen and so far feature i've year . creative , engaging unpredictable wierd incredible pace funny list just goes on loved stories moral tale of greed love conquering all it was told in a more respectable dignified way than an in-your-face you must heed mawkish beauty is that it's target audience directed at adults children walk away from movie feeling good completely understand why its called spirited
this was a great movie - didn't get bored once . beautiful animation and very creative characters.. that black robed , white masked dude whacko.
excellent movie with some of the most oddball characters you'll ever see in an animated film . animation was brilliant as well
my fave . it is beautiful , interesting and makes ya think i wanna buy this oscar winning classic
an intellectual delight to watch . i loved this movie! ! it was even more original than being john malkovich
the newest miyazaki hayao's animation . it's a fantasy story and its good for kids
tremendous film , well worth its reputation . great script performances intelligent serious wouldn't make much of an impression most the clods in america during this post-literate era we're living basically because it be likely that a video game tie-in could established also no special effects and reese witherspoon tom cruise ben-wa affleck none other two dozen or so no-talents on hollywood round robin are cast
monkeys !
long regarded as one of the outright masterpieces world cinema,renoir's 1937 anti-war film was first in a foreign language to be nominated for best oscar.its tale french soldiers war 1 german prisoner camp banned by goebbels not any anti-german feeling but precisely depth its wisdom and message common shared humanity across national boundaries.typically,renoir conveys his cinematically,without resorting preaching or over-emphasis,the dialogue is intelligent ever,the performances notable cast(including great jean gabin,and former famous director erich von stroheim,whom many will remember butler sunset boulevard)superb,and plot itself never less than fully involving.still tremendous,inspirational totally relevant experience .
greatest film ever made .
un chefd'oeuvre
excellent film about a chinese woman's marriage many years ago . this one will keep you so interested , won't mind reading the subtitles
an outstanding but heartachingly tragic tale of female suffering and jealous intrigue in 1920's china,from the country's leading director zhang yimou,and starring beautiful,great gong li.a 19 year old is forced to become fourth concubine wife a wealthy master,who arranges for red lantern be placed outside quarters he will favour spend night with.refined gorgeously colourful,with sumptuous decor(in constrained setting),this possibly peak formidable yimou-gong li partnership- though several fine films made by couple i would also most strongly recommend marvellous sorghum .
raise the red lantern is one of my all time favorite films . it so visually beautiful and zhang yimou's use color (as in rest his films) mind blowing film not only powerful was politically enough to get banned china depiction gender relations perhaps most moving modern cinema we follow central character (played by wonderful gong li) through her life master's house until fall into madness , see opression strike out harshly because there a scene rtrl death that i would argue well constructed scenes suspense horror brilliant
raise the red lantern is hot like it's leading lady , beautiful gong li . i loved it
well then,farrellsfilm,get a copy out of library or blockbuster ! that is,if you want my opinion....this is film that,if are lucky,will change your life . it incredible
the american version i purchased is heavily censored for sexual content .
a great , influential film from kurosawa .
another excellent entry by kurosawa , and probably a little more accessable to the casual fan than some of his other work . classic western movie will be familiar with clint eastwood version fistful dollars
toshiro mifune is still the last samurai .
you see my screen name
yojimbo is a great movie . spectacular acting and directing from two of the greatest it so good , bruce willis did remake tv show pokemon
the movie is about mystery of identity in a violent clan based social order rather simple war . it evocative and beautifully done
this is possibly the single most heart-wrenching foreign/war movies i have ever seen . last scene of movie left me in tears as great emprire crumbles and banner floats away had superb directing a definite must see for any fanatic
bergman's most brilliant,radical and original masterpiece,voted by international critics one of the all-time top 10,examines relationship between an actress recovering from a breakdown nurse caring for her at remote swedish seaside cottage.a challenging film , but intimate,perceptive extremely rewarding.the acting bibi andersson liv ullmann in lead roles is quietly astonishing.essential viewing lovers arthouse cinema .
fellini at his poetic best ! the movie that launched and wife's careers into stardom . it was first to win foreign language film oscars
francois ozon is the best director around today !
clue but in a french musical sort of way . some cinema's best known names are this movies and it is about 8 women who connected to each other murder not only do have something hide their motivations opportunity for murdering the victim , hiding secret own as well will timeless catherine denueve film icons danielle darrieux fanny ardant emmanuelle beart more movie packs talent dark comedy liberally laced with songs appropriate character plot you identify atleast one characters surprise ending unexpected
if you think that black white movies have no visual interest for , again and try this movie . the way light shines trough leaves on trees is absolutely magic story of simple or it ? you'll hear from different people a ghost what occurred,and will to make up yourself happened great japanese
one of my absolute favorite movies all time ! rashomon proves that kurosawa is a genius just as seven samurai and ran do . aside from , this the best japanese film ever made (that i've seen course)
an excellent movie from director . all the actors were great and story was interesting
this movie rocks , dude
i was very surprised when todo sobre mi madre won the european film awards '99 , not only for best actress but also ! quite sure either f..... . m l [show me love] mifunes sidste sang or nothing hill would win it's said that this is pedro almodovar's his true masterpiece it doesn'tstop there : movie ranked as 100 of imdb users and ranking 8.7 out 10 to have something compare leader imdb's top 250 godfather 9.0 10.. finally world has a chance see spanish language 500 million people talk tonight fact golden globe foreign :o)
what a delightful movie . amazing that almodovar is still able to get mileage from his constant themes of sexual estrangement and confusion , but he does though this about lot more than it's beautifully shot too the acting terrific
has anyone any doubt about if this film is going to win year's oscar for foraign category ? i'm sure it will ! look carefully the following actress : penelope cruz , really great!! and she so pretty.. .
i don't care who or why , abortion is murder of a life god created . am sure there are people think they doing good but when it involves the destruction human end never justifies means nor reason have been researching lives women had abortions and you hear how their progress after decide to kill babies many lifelong struggles with all sorts emotional issues some can't stand be around because makes them child destroyed relationship problems that last lifetime become drug alcohol abusers no one ever tells these things may permanent part an committed suicide from guilt killing baby hollywood can glamorize just about anything will get warm fuzzy feeling say what wonderful person she was playing !
absolutely fantastic ! very ott but great with it . guy pearce is definately shrugging off his history the australian soap 'neighbours' this film deals homophobia as well , so if anyone really against queens and gay men don't bother watching you won't see for what a comedy where empathise characters
this movie touches on some of the superstitions , mores and other mystic values that cultures have associated with food . it talks about passion desire love all repressed then released i loved however those you who are unfamiliar w/foreign cinema may not appreciate as much
a masterpiece , an utterly beautiful film all the more amazing because it was filmed in paris during occupation . hundred nay thousand times better than disney atrocity
if you want to see a great movie , this is certainly one . i know lot of people have an aversion reading subtitles but time when shouldn't let that bother completely captivating film and it's considered by many be even better than the disney version i'm little undecided on very close race rent (if can find it) you'll glad did just give it chance
a musical , visual and human delight ! one of fellini's best the humor translates fine for american audiences .
this movie was so cool ! i didn't really catch onto what happening untnil like the middle , but then saw it again and got how it's very different that character is....it's just a you have to see .
excellent movie ! beautifully directed which packing the punch and displaying wonderful colourful atmosphere of an indian punjabi wedding .
this has long been one of my three favorite films , along with tarkovsky's andrei rublev and bergman's persona . 8 1/2 is a milestone in cinema history perhaps the quintessential modernist feature (to rip off gerald mast's short movies) an objective list it would inevitably come third behind citizen kane rules game
spanish conquistadors,driven on by the obsessive klaus kinski,search for fabled lost city of gold,eldorado - through hallucinatory peruvian landscapes mist-enveloped mountains,dense rainforest,exotic wildlife and mighty,challenging amazon.a mesmerising adventure unforgettable journey armchair spectator !
the title speaks for it all . ya gotta know spanish to understand !
fast action . intriguing cinematography if you can stomach the dog fight scenes , it is well worth watching a few times
hard movie to watch but really fine . and gael garcia bernal is an actor !
oh yes , love is a bitch .
gibson is god . awesome movie the fighting rules
exceptional piece of cinema art . intriguing , intelligent beautifully shot and exhausting this film requires demands your utmost attention if you are to gain a fully comprehensive understanding picture is executed with real feeling complemnented by haunting sounds ambience one question how does shelby know his wife dead he has 'condition' cannot create new memories after the accident ? (shelby can learn basic physical motions through systematic repition but i don't think applies in case)
for me this movie was really worth watching . of course i have an advantage since i've lived a year in chile speak english fluently , but most parts however hard to get because the mexican slang very commonly that reason text became essential unfortunately is quite white so time it almost impossible read as you see pictures important part my experience and liked ! not immediately after while got huge sympathy many characters like brother who love with his sister old guerillero chance daughter again couldn't stop thinking her had it's funny touchy well learned new 'money' : we say 'plata' (silver) obviously mexico they lana (wool) :-)
i am a sucka for hard , urban violence flicks (clockwork orange scar face taxi driver reservoir dogs traffic tesis etc.) . thus this one is definitely worth paying adult full price to see once again in my book many would classify piece as pulp fiction-esque yet ignoring the fact that characters are not self-righteous and confident senior tarantino s talented expensive cast inarrit crew 100% chilango (people from mexico city) hated loved by rest of these ambivalent feelings manifested their internal love/hate self people city political economic talent country (exemplified having la new york dc all major big 3 social strata pictured trilogy bonded car crash chosen heroes deflated fullest extent : showing so instinctive betrayal nature (oxymoron) portrayed serves be more vicious than numerous mutilating scenes there between man women daughter brothers no ideal nor woman don t hope leave theater identifying with someone per se nevertheless however implicit an (un)certain sense throughout flick undying un-denying unconditional love few very well thought-out relationships
this is a superb italian film and tells the story of poor postman who delivers mail to hands famous poet in exile , pablo neruda . postman's life changed by he learns read write poetry as well become active politics must see !
this quietly observant tale of an elderly japanese couple who visit their(adult)children in tokyo,but find only their widowed daughter-in-law makes them welcome,is among the most humane,wise and poignant films ever made,rightly considered a true masterpiece world cinema.(voted 3rd best film sight sound international poll,1992).it also happens to be my wife's personal favourite .
a beautiful poignant film about family . it will leave you heartbroken after watching genuine brilliance from yasujiro ozu's masterful pallette
in a traditional danish farming community,a severe father forbids one of his 3 sons to marry the daughter man different religious convictions . not likely appeal viewers with low attention span or fans breakneck-speed action(and film which i was certainly slow appreciate),this simple tale faith does ask for thoughtful concentration.its virtues -exquisitely composed decor and exceptional control black,white grey tones-unfold slowly,quietly,to almost transcendental effect.as director asked , how can such perfection exist ? 
wonderful actors- daniel auteuil and juliette binoche- who were made to play together , the terrifying decisions taken by autorities . you should see it will astonish
this is one beautiful movie , i tell you guys . it deserves a five can see over and again never get bored of true story
another movie i might have given 4 and a half stars to if it were an option . the writing does dip once or twice briefly but this story of boy who's lost his mother fantasizes about first dog sent into outer space is one my favorite four's too low , so give five
wings of desire is one the most beautiful , thought provoking films ever made . from very first scene wenders illustrates a world isolation and connection fallen saved wonderful journey through what it means to be human mortal cinematography outstanding this film touched me so deeply became instant classic for about love life others will make you look around yourself feel differently your existence it's that good
luis was onto something with this...only this film and possibly eraserhead truly illustrate surrealism as a medium through the 20th century . will trip most people out though , so viewer must be an objective one
peter weir australian made this flick with a young mel gibson . two aussies are in the anzac forces that fight gallipoli peninsula disaster turks almost blow them back to australia as singer notes song , "the band played waltzing matilda." hard watch you cringe over such waste !
well i also would give this film a 4.5 , but that wasn't an option . due to the horrible sudden outbursts of ear-piercing proto new age syntho-rock it was too good movie let ruin though
if four and a half were an option i might have given it that on the off-chance there's even better movie out there . but is just too low excellent film
outstanding . this movie was much more powerful for me than either platoon or saving private ryan it is the story of a couple australian sprinters who are sent to unwinnable battle gallipoli there some really chilling scenes how men act when they know facing certain death do not rent if you looking an uplifting
an incredible , but true story that was a terrific movie . the recent book hitler's jewish soldier's by bryan mark rigg adds to its importance
another instance when i wish 4 and a half stars were an option . four is just too low so give it five excellent , film why aren't more american movies this good ?
fantastic movie ! it's the story of a boy who is jewish in germany before and during war passes himself off as pure german . wonderfully done , one best foreign language films i've ever seen so good that you forget you're reading it just get wrapped up drama see it!
one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen!! !
at last ! a teen movie that's not about girls fighting off hormone - driven dumbbells jess and her girlfriend were smart ; their parents lamebrained bigots the teens compromised [instead of hollywood's parental cave-ins] -- talking smashing stereotypes i love culture clash briton versus east indian especially when it's done right . this was
a wonderful movie . i really enjoyed the characterisations and performances by entire cast jess' neighborhood is an analog of every middle-class family's throughout world
wonderful movie ! gives a very good insight about indians living abroad and of course all in comic way . not boring at hope to see more such movies future
great movie....... .
excellent film , incredible story of triumph and overcoming just unbelieveable odds . so many uplifting inspiring moments it's one those films where (and i know a lot have these but i'm still going to note it) this guy is pushed down around seen as nothing for long then he's starts coming becomes recognized the skill he has you feel really good when his father carries him into pub beer think saw my friend shed tear (he's kind sally)
haunting and beautiful .
by far the most important post-war russian director,andrei tarkovsky was proclaimed ingmar bergman , greatest,the one who invented a new language,true to nature of film,as it captures life as reflection,life dream .with its ambitious scope,astounding set-pieces,magisterial pacing and glorious colour finale this towering episodic account medieval icon painter (replete with witches,pagan rituals,and sacking monasteries tatar hordes) is convincing portrait period justifiably vatican's #1 recommended film awesome artistic achievements 20th century !
excellent danish independent film . read more about it at http://www.dogme95.dk/menu/menuset.htm
great danish movie . enjoyable (extreme) people !
the director is an heir of hitchcock . it a movie very different from what french people usually do , but you won't be disappointed !
the best indian movie ever made .
my favourite hindi movie by far..easily one of the biggest blockbusters to come out bollywood..the acting was awesome..the story simple and good..had a nice touch humour..this had everything..had an amazin starcast..if you havent seen it u have see it..borrow it..if dont know read subtitles..trust me its worth it..amitabh's hit. .
eisenstein near his best in a brilliant , brutal film . using the saga of teutonic knights campaign against russians middle ages draws parallell with rising threat nazi germany helmeted faceless sturdy sometimes comedic russian soldiers horrific burning babies scene and final denouement on ice are unforgettable bits cinema add to that an score by prokoviev what exists is work art
excellent movie!! !
possibly the best , and with perfect hindsight of history most frightening propaganda film ever made . riefenstahl's documentary covering a nazi rally in nuremberg 1934 has terrible beauty about it from opening sequence hitler's plane descending clouds its shadow growing across ancient city to geometric rigidity itself watching after events that came wake is like dance death but sly seductive indeed
this is one of the most visually stunning movies i have ever seen . jeunet and caro create a world so realistic yet different that couldn't help but wonder if they in fact live on same planet as myself atmosphere dark which allows humor to juxtapose beautifully watch film you enjoy beauty
as a bonafide brazil-phile , i must admit my bias here . regardless found this to be the best brazilian film since amor bandido (1979) relationship between child and adult woman who finds him living in train station is engrossing what liked most about however was it's sheer believeability - sadly phenomenon of street kids does exists there thus there's subtle dose social commentary mixed with gripping storyline recommended
everyone was so unbelievably natural in this movie , especially the brilliant female star that i felt truly looking into their lives . very worth seeing
very touching ! :o)
isabel adjani is not only one of the most beautiful actresses ever , but she also a remarkably fine actress as well . camille claudel really shows off her talent which made #1 in france don't miss breathtaking performance deadly summer : you'll never forget beauty or acting!! !
this movie was awesome , most especially because of the incredible performance isabelle adjani .
by far the best piece of film to come out this year . originality is something rarely seen in hollywood anymore and has it
more genius from kurosawa . the film is shown pov of 2 lowest characters in , which lucas adapted for star wars
during the civil wars in 16th century japan,two cowardly peasants chance upon a noble samurai(the great toshiro mifune)protecting beautiful,spirited princess as they undertake perilous journey through enemy territory.the memorable wide-screen compositions , distinctive landscapes and exciting plot make for an extremely entertaining enjoyable adventure.though relatively neglected (compared with several other kurosawa films),hidden fortress was,incidentally acknowledged inspiration star wars,and should prove accessible to viewers less familiar foreign language cinema .
antonioni's best .
a film about an old man who ends up caring for little boy and adopting him , because his mother does not return . light-hearted touching !
my lord , akira kurosawa's dreams is an eye stunning beauty . the late kurosawa a of film world this movie in every way see it
please watch this movie . visually stunning , kurosawa's movies have inspired some our most popular directors plus martin scorsese has a cameo as vincent van gogh !
wow do i like this film . well done , beautiful cinematography wonderful character and a very compelling story i've seen several times would have no hesitation watching it again in fact i'd look forward to when the grandpa pulls shotgun out from under breakfast table front of whole family tries fails shoot mouse doorway everyone falls silent as he stews over (great grumpy fuddy duddy english grandfather) little boy says think you got him was limping see but it's funny trust me
the great warmly comic movie about blitz . a scene : when little boy , going to his school one morning sees that building has been bombed he cries out skies 'thank you hitler.'
this is a beatiful movie , in the tradition of great french coming-of-age movies . it's not quite as magical '400 blows' but it aims for different effect : both very personal story about boys growing up and period piece occupied france i won't go into details if you like cinema see
the favourite film of russian critics(in a 1995 poll)is deeply personal and complex autobiographical account childhood,as well as an ambitious overview 20th century life history..although pacing , time shifts occasionally impenetrable meanings(typical director tarkovsky) will not appeal to all tastes,the rapturous poetry its images is unsurpassed.rendering mundane objects elements almost miraculous,it intense,inspiring beauty;a serious utterly unique work art .
with kwok in the movie and cordnating it its best of all time
it has been a long time since i have seen very well worked and original style of storytelling in feature film . this is simply incredible manages to be mysterious,well acted,bravely honestly directed,humorous above all gripping sucks you refuses let go cannot leave the theater had pee point almost passed out still could not tear myself away from ingeniouse tail story told backward that last event first what we know our main character's , played by guy peirce wife raped murdered he for revenge sounds rather run mill,right ? witnesses happen tries rescue his gets severe blow head which leaves him with strange psychological disorder no short term memory old memories just make any new ones most take polaroid pictures scroll noted form tattos over body so might track down kill wifes murderer gives such wonderfully twisted remarkable edge haven't something cool since,dare say forever made my list top films 2001 memento profound breakthrough should considered classic anyone who enjoys art telling treat themselves astonishing work highly recommended
this movie gets 5 stars for the body count alone . chow yun fat , tony leung and anthony wong are all great but best thing about is voilence gun clips never run out there bad guys always available to get shot hospital scene fight ever caught on film
it's not possible to have make a better and faster paced film;it's there could be any movie bullets left anywhere...one of the classics .
a very entertaining and incredibly voilent police thriller movie starring the immortal chow yun fat made by equally brilliant john woo . film was in 1992 plot revolves around inspector yuen (chow fat) his undercover buddy/rival tony (tony leung) trying to bust some hong kong arms smugglers first scene is classic , chicken cages everywhere that jumping bit with dual sub-machine guns another great when freestyle raps baby he's carrying keep him entertained while he fights off ever more gun-toting gangsters this typical fare simplistic (yet poignant little paper boats metaphor life pretty interesting i thought) characters bucketloads of voilence
godard's visionary film . the seminal new wave flick
the most charming and well-animated movie i have ever seen . watch it once for delightful story of devoted grandmotherly love , twice plethora minor characters a third time amazing animation (especially way light shadow are used) fourth because you can't get enough maybe even fifth just to delight again in triplets' culinary orchestral eccentricities
great movie but its called the triplets of bellvile .
this is my second all time favorite the other lawrence of arabia . i must find out who owns real chocolate labrador doc
my absolute favourite movie of all times , and that's not (only) because it's mexican . ;) really a straight-forward honest sexy captivating motion picture ! :)
this is the granddaddy of all adventure films . henri-georges cluzot made film about 4 men stuck in a south american village with dirt and grit , heat humidity filling theater they get their last chance for redemption by taking two trucks filled nitroglycerine over andes through jungle swamps to extinguish an oil well fire you will sit on edge your seat entire trip billy friedkin remade as sorcerer i only catches intensity
depicting a japanese architect's affair (at hiroshima,in 1959) with french actress , who recalls her wartime love for german soldier under nazi occupation,this is ground-breaking,and highly influential arthouse masterpiece.its intertwining of past and present,and different personal political experiences handled rare sensitivity elegance wholly cinematic expertise.a challenging but refined,quietly moving brilliant film .
the best french movie of 2000 , it is a pleasure to see such good with an excellent cast . jean-pierre bacri terrific and i would advise you in  if dare say because there's wonderful scene which he speaks so well english could scare death about people.. enjoy that typically !
outstanding ! one of my favorate movies all time
ang lee's eat drink man woman is a feast to die for . great movie
this is an excellent film . i would recommend to anyone who enjoys foreign films filmed in taiwan it's the story of a father and his three daughters , on high school other two adults their differnt life paths love interestes etc okay so that sounds kind simple but very well done funny used be chef at grand hotel there are lots really visually stimulating cooking scenes see !
awesome!!! !
best movie of all time ! see the sequel too
great movie and a tool to share the gospel . christian organizations should create more such clean movies
left behind was the best movie i have ever seen.it tells exactly what bible says.it is confusing in beging , but then very informal.the graphics,sound affects and directing where great.i reccomend everyone to rent this because it not a wate of money worth more than costs .
would love to see more of these . hollywood is making trashy films , and despite the fact they are rated adults stilllet children tag along i am tired being sodom gommorah babylon that why don't hardly go movies anymore even my television practically turned off now do reading things will up lift instead smut view
a diffirent movie but worth while to see .
i am not a biblical scholar , but totally illiterate either . from what have observed since becoming christian there seem to be as many opinions about the rapture are people all of them claim certain passages in bible backup their viewpoint pre-tribulation post at did enjoy this movie point do with most any film book or personal opinion took it grain salt merely depicts an interpretation educated guess by someone view whatever actually takes place should interesting topic discussion and study division for me my beliefs simple assured that saved grace through faith jesus christ when he returns - has promised final prophecy reveals will complete know him because already
this movie can really show the truth about what is going to happen . it a very moving and great witnessing tool i took as many people possible who think that rapture won't , you will be sorry when are left with termoil grief hope writing check out possibilty of happening anyone reading please believe
i saw the left behind movie and thought it was very well done ! read all books think having not been edited by hollywood standards stayed much along story in book . can understand why some might be threatened truth of am sure that when jerry jenkins tim lahaye went ahead with idea they were fully aware would react a critical way once heard man god say cross is offensive it's content , because calls person to thier own accountability so makes sense anything referring christ will offend those reject given this brings up fear unbelievers experience just like did first time revelation as non-believer acting refreshing
this sweet and unassuming movie is the coming-of-age story of two gay working class teens from london's east end council flats . believable touching it never preaches doesn't grasp at cliches acting first-rate all leads mama cass soundtrack perfect
excellent movie with brillant and entertaing comedy . awesome soundtrack i just love the aussie accents great cast an aborably realistic touching storyline tre bien !
this movie is the best ! it's one of my favourites . it being about a dancing competition doesn't sound very appealing at first but more than just relationship between two main characters sweet and you really want them to be together
excellent movie overall . a few bizarre artistic touches , but very intriguing love triangle story with twist courtesy of the stalinist purges not family
french genius in every frame . magnifique !
memento is a great movie . the best i have seen this year about man who tries to solve his wife's murder due killing , he has lost short term memory so must write notes on case story told backwards we viewers feel like no shortterm know what happening now screen but do not how got there don't want give anything away guy pierce as carrie ann moss and joe palmention (?) it truly an original urge people go see
fantastic sequel to jean de florette ! makes the first movie that much better .
probably one of the worst movies ever made but i still like to watch it cos its so stupid , oh godzilla ..... .
the most powerful giant monster movie of all time .
i truly believe that this is the greatest giant monster movie ever made , second only to king kong . however upon close comparison between (the japanese version) and it becomes quite obvious both are completely different kind of films in traditional hollywood fashion shot as an entertainment piece while godzilla under scrutiny a testimony by people who have right depict horrible devastation nuclear disaster fact alone fascinates us well endurability character we all love but course must not forget efforts given master dream-weavers tomuyuki tanaka provided concept ishiro honda arguably director science fiction fantasy makes radiation visible eiji tsuburaya's effects excellent for their time although they do hold up today akira ifukube's score entirely evocative horrors war causes there one most recognizable characters all-time he emerges symbol japan's inner-fears at same very versatile has become pop-artifact would place without hesitation among motion pictures
a beautiful film , crafted by master - kieslowski . polish director working in france tells story through the eyes of juliette binoche's character woman who has lost her husband and child terrible car accident it deals with grief how she rebuilds life music is outstanding
the first and , i think best of tricolors trilogy by polish writer/director krzysztof kieslowski . most emotional three with a tremendous score juliet binoche is haunting beautiful as ever ; her reserve somewhat cold beauty suit kieslowski's themes pain liberty very well
in the words of great chairman yi-yi , that's me movie is a three hour ride into family life . one greatest films 2000
this was an incredible , engrossing thriller ! it's about a man who is trying to avenge his wife's death however he badly beaten and has no short-term memory . takes photos writes notes tatoos reminders all over body in order find the killer real kicker that scenes are filmed backwards sequence so you know end of story right at start movie but...can figure out beginning... ? must see you'll be talking for weeks afterwards
el mariachi intrigues me...in some ways it seems cheap and hokey , like a homemade video but still mesmerizes me with its portrayal of gangland border drug culture that smashes headlong into the life an innocent young who wants nothing more than to be allowed play his guitar sing.. . definitely entertaining flick !
i love that this flick was done with a budget of about what have in my wallet right now . gratuitous violence galore but its also got some real comic gems -- especially if you speak little border spanglish azul rules , baby !
stunning final 1/3 of the bleu / blanc rouge trilogy . serious people should own all three plus , lead actresses are scorchingly hot
my partner and i watched this on channel 4 along with the idiots late one night - we were so impressed film . its realistic it keeps you hanging 'did he?' acting is superb ! that has to go into video collection
best scandinavian film ever ! :o) the second european in '98 after la vita bella and a year with under average films like shakespear love saving private ryan , it was even world nominated to golden globe for foreign language but central do brasil won i don't think is as good festen . wrong not nominate oscar bflf isn't just it's also important topic childrens' relation their parents still holy tabu
the best bond film along with goldfinger . 'red' grant and rosa klebb are among most memorable screen villains ever fight on train knife-shoe scenes have become classics babe is ok but not
one of the most emotionally beautiful movies i have ever watched . outstanding !
the award-winning fim-which was recently re-released stars richard dreyfus as duddy who schemes his way to acquiring restricted land in a great adaptation of mordecai richler classic .
beast bond .aliza gur was hot but who wouldve won between the two female fighters .
beat takeshi is the greatest !
this drama-cum-ghost story set in war-ravaged 16th century japan,from the shakespeare of film ,kenji mizoguchi (whose other masterpieces include sansho bailiff,story late chrysanthemums and life oharu)is one most beautiful films ever made,voted among 10 greatest sight sound's international poll.blessed with serene fluid camerawork,exquisite cinematography,painterly compositions ravishing landscapes for which director(still terribly neglected english-speaking world)was renowned.the scenes where potter falls under spell enchanting lady wukasa are a peak world cinema .
the orpheus legend updated to post-war paris.the poet's entrancement with an enigmatic,irresistibly sensuous princess of death leads him through mirror eerie,unforgettable otherworld.a truly unique fantasy,landscaped leather-clad bikers,street cafes,mysterious buildings,bizarre coded messages,vengeful feminists and almost fetishist clothing-helped along by negative images,reverse slow-motion a feast imaginative visual effects.one famous critic left cinema quivering excitement  !
a couple is going home after night on the town when they see woman chased by thugs . husband drives off without calling police wife astounded that she could be married to guy so callous visits girl in hospital next day nurses back health and while doing gets talk tell her story tells everything even up point comes into couples life confesses it was left beaten very sorry because attitude what has caused have kind of son set motion chain events leads great ending movie please this
fantastic film ! an absolute must see movie this is very heavily into symbolic imagery . speaking about his , the director referred to it by saying that some directors share lsd trip they with audience but pill let's each viewer have their own unique
a man is the lone survivor of plane crash . he then taken under wing guy who recruits lucky people his mentor informs him that has luck power , and to steal other people's takes underground gambling places where needed they take pictures so if someone loses surrendered through picture do things like run forest blindfolded play russian roulette with five bullets traffic girfriends  tries get them back i am not doing this movie justice it great
this movie is fantastic ! cate blanchett and giovanni ribsi are electric together . one of my all-time favorite movies!
bob hoskins takes on the ira in london as even american mafia leave town.hoskins was gangster made for part .
on new year's eve in tehran , a 7 year old girl sets her heart buying pretty goldfish,but time and events seem to conspire against her.from this slight premise,aided immensely by kiarostami's script young mohammedkhani's irresistible performance,director panahi delivers wholly absorbing convincing child's eye view of shopkeepers,snakecharmers,soldiers strangers,while generating quite amazing level suspense.new york critics' film the winner numerous other awards white balloon is worthy representative iran's magnificent contemporary cinema:a fascinating cultural insight,ideal family viewing,and miniature delight .
a barge captain and dreamily romantic young bride travel the seine parisian waterways,in company of numerous cats memorably eccentric first mate with hoard unusual bric-a-brac . warm,leisurely,lyrical gently anarchic adventure,infused poetic sense wonderment,jean vigo's only feature film(before his death at 28)has been voted one world's top 10 in polls.a precious pearl,to be discovered cherished
roberto benigni was the greatest comic actor of his day (he makes dopes like adam sandler look amateurs) . then he became afflicted with fatal disease all-too-common among great comedians : wish to be a 'serious' , working in movies too bad this one is probably funniest but 'the monster' pretty good
gong li is sexy in the movie of all times . great i , chairman yi-yi love this dearly
leave behind any misconceptions about indian cinema;this wonderful satyajit ray film (the first of the famous apu trilogy)about a young boy and his poor family in bengal is far removed from gaudy extravagant melodramatic bollywood musicals,and undoubtedly one crowning achievements world cinema.winner 1955 cannes festival,it's gently engaging,beautifully observant nature,imbued with child's sense wonderment,as well as deeply lyrical,wise poetic.recommended unreservedly,to anyone who prefers contemplative pleasures to breakneck action .
hugo weaving as a blind man who distrusts the world , genevieve picot his housekeeper loves him yet torments incessantly and sweet russell crowe innocent brings honesty revelation into their lives . fascinating characters subtle plotline one of my all time favorites foreign or domestic

i've never understood what mike myers' problem was , but i bought the premise that he's evil incarnate hook line sinker . also fell for his inability to die - a silly you believe it in this movie frankly don't know why works maybe awesome simple sequenced music score director's use of complementary colors (orange blue) suburbia as backdrop fact there are no parents anywhere around after michael shows up on scene thought quick view under mask wasn't necessary that's my only gripe course one is 1st modern slasher film (really psycho compare 2 and you'll see where halloween's influence comes from i'll give hint : think swinging light bulb) did dress ghost rip headstone he seem like collector when kills guy so pissed off at women won't part movie's effect all these unanswered questions dead ? go hiding near
i'd have to say that this could be the best horror movie of all time . i love whole michel myers thing is a classic havn't seen really good film in while and even though befor my , still loved it more movies should like it's exciting heart pounding throughout am forever an original halloween fan
good god this is scary its my favorite of all time the best i guarantee u wont be dissapointed movie awsome jamie great just whole concept it will scared s***htless throught donald plesance man part in closet that was freaky rent now
unquestionably the greatest horror film of all time ! this movie is perhaps one most influential movies its , setting stage for ripoffs like friday 13th . keeps an eerie feel to it way until end and michael myers definitely dynamic characters ever depicted in a props john carpenter creepy music
wow...to this day movie sends chills down my spine...i remember when it was first released and i saw it...halloween for me after that never quite the same ! best in slasher series of films came out late 70's 80's , is classic genre horror . brilliance here we see michael myers real face...we as audience are allowed to be his character camera wears mask looking two eyes...and one where music adds so much feel tension action like most movies there some predictability...like how a certain number disposable characters who you know just going end up at wrong place time group halloween movies...the others followed were horrible..
john carpenter does an excellent job of setting the mood in most his movies . you feel like are part action on screen rather than just sitting audience watching a movie if liked this , check out some other thing  escape from new york or especially assault precinct 13 too bad he hasn't made decent years :(
my favorite horror film of all time . this one is not nearly as gory you would think there so much suspense and build-up it does pay off at the end will be scared that dang creepy music get to too
no matter how old it may be , it's stil one of the greatest spine-tinglers ever created . even most courageous will still look behind him if he/she watches this in dark night donald pleseance is great any role she plays jaime lee was perfect because let's face it......if john decided to just put some bimbo up there would really stupid such a soundtrack too knew set mood only few have reached acclaim status masterpiece
probably the best slasher film ever made . maybe not horror , but i emphasize
the original is a classic !
the only movie that ever scared me . carpenter's score was as effective williams' jaws
to begin , this is a twenty year old film . few films remain as suspenseful today they did when it came out (see : night of the living dead -- had people running from theatres released but very tame today) clearly movie fan brought up on standards today's movies will fail find enjoyment such 'classic' watching halloween perhaps helps consider things was low budget (read bad acting poor special effects) made for only $300,000 not product hollywood bunch 20 olds first feature boogeyman that wouldn't die which has been ripped off time and again in friday 13th elm street scream etc you're used now even look villian theme teenagers being stalked by madman numerous times well (again first) what seperates imitators plays traditional fears thing ; coming get you followed boyfriend returning room under bedsheet it's really him someone hiding car.. all have our skin crawl real life at one or another tonight years i found myself edge my seat classic ? hell yes is,and generation who thinks absolute pinnacle horror genre just words say....they don't make them good anymore....and ya know hard try they'll never be able again.....sincerely,your friendly neighborhood shape
one of the most influential horror films scince texas chainsaw massacre . john carpenter really out did himself this time micheal myers is interesting , unique and creepy characters ever created movie keeps up feel to it well foundations today great score too goes with a must see classic
halloween represents the beginning of an era where a great story can be told for minimum budget . i have no doubt -- this movie would never been such success without signature soundtrack like psycho  , demonstrates synergy between sight and sound (mute your tv watch end or it is totally different.)
probably about the greatest scary movie of all time . maybe it has something to do with fact that is shown over again every halloween , so many us grew up but just gives you a creepy feeling when watch ! 5 stars goes original film only...none sequels were worth much
great movie !
the father of horror,halloween,is a mildstone horror movie . it managed to balance creepy atmosphere,character developement,suspence and what would become greatest mad man ever grace screen this was no easy task especially with budget granted young film makers john carpenter debra hill influenced generations films copy cats you cannot deny goosebump endoesing score also scored by is an independent masterpeice in my opinion casablanca genre anyone at all interested must see not since original psycho had such brilliantly made been do any sequels
great series . one of my all time favorites as a kid good music hella scary story everyone was acting classic horror movie
this is one of my favorite movies all time . not only did it start jamie lee curtis' career , but led to other halloween the that has scared me cinematography on movie was outstanding
this movie is so good to me , i watch all of them . my most favorite movies
man , this is an absolute classic . michael myers might be the best of slashers very creepy soundtrack they made quite a lot with little
oscar-calibur performances by judd and jones make this film unforgettable , keep it going like a roller coaster . twists turns the alive
easily the scariest flick i've ever seen...though second half or so is pure slasher , what i found were scenes which showed michael stalking around in middle of daytime . very creepy
i feel this is a classic horror movie . good suspense with minimal blood and gore no really gratuitous nude scenes which like was drawn into the story felt genuinely scared jamie lee curtis convincing probably best halloween
i really enjoyed this all time great horror movie . had a storyline and helped propel stream of flicks such as nightmare on elm street micheal meyers is probably the greatest , most unique character ever created
the first was great  !
another stanley kubrick masterwork . i could watch it every week and never get tired of the overlook hotel is most menacing horror film set--no question
the slow , certain build up to jack's insanity is great . scene with little girls haunted me for weeks after i first saw it and don't go in room 237
this oneis my favorite!!!!!!!!!! !
an excellent script acted out by fantastic actors .
creepy as hell and i am not just talking about the hotel itself
holy crap , that was a terrifying movie!! ! should be #1!!
i saw on good morning america several years ago that part of this movie is based real events . the guy who killed his family with an axe actually happened in a similar isolated hotel guess because cabin fever very scary film
frightening movie . did he go insane becouse had no alcohol ? or was realy possesed excelent script and directing definently one of my favorites
i love jack! !
the most underrated epic of all time . this movie was first to have realistic battles and corretly portray dark times middle ages combined with an unforgetable story , characters visuals soundtrack scriptline makes it my favorite j.r.r tolkien based his character aragorn after untold william wallace in real life those who say a bad film narrow taste films because meets standards included on top 100 20th century lists won 5 academy awards including best picture director (mel gibson) some may historically inaccurate but like said film...history is written by hanged heroes every man dies not really lives
it is a classic , who does not like . stephan king genious i tis great movie
great flick on so many levels . the writing produced some of lines in movie history , jack nicholson was phenomenal as father struggling to keep a grip reality and his sanity is just scary hell with memorable visuals i wouldn't know where begin horror fan or not this must see
much better than the cheap televison remake . jack nicholson sure knows how to play a loony kept you on e edge of your seat book was though everyone should see this movie it is classic
fantastic movie . brilliant interplay of tension and scenery so many memorable scenes , some that are harder to verbalize sure everybody has heard here's johnny ! but what about the chase through topiary ?
this movie is a classic . to day , it has the ability creep me out beyond belief and i've seen about 20 times proves that stanley kubrick could not have made boring ineffective if he tried in any other director's hands (i.e whoever directed horrible for tv remake 1997) been unintentionally hilarious especially with jack nicholson's kid-gloves-are-off performance but creates such menacing atmosphere his visuals music sound effects (like heart beats) becomes something haunt your dreams (and will) overlook hotel--number one on list of horror film settings frightening occasionally surreal experience through
way better than the tv remake .
i would love to be able see it again .
the shining is scariest movie ever made . i can't watch it alone , creeps me out jack nicholson played one of most terrifying villains ! gives cold chills just thinking about this flick
probably the best horror movie ever . a wonderful cast with an added blend of excellent one-liners from jack nicholson very creepy moments throughout film include kitchen overlook hotel and two young female twins who visit little boy while riding his big wheel down hallways quiet to terror
most people are looking for stephen king's novel brought to life - but kubrick basically abandoned everything king had described aside from names and the basic plot line . just used spine of create his masterpiece around he also many different purposes changing things even though i read book first , think kubrick's movie tells a better more real effective horrifying tale
this movie is a masterpiece (same with the book) it was not scary but so deep and powerful.the ending wasn't best ther true to novel which very,very good book far from bad . very interesting 2 girls that were killed haunting danny really freaky.a great movie,despite few flaws deserves 4.5 since i can't,it 5 than 4
one saturday i turned on the tv couldnt turn it off for like 3 whole hours :d lets just say this is top notch stuff . theres sooo much suspense most people htink its old so sucks and thought too but omg movie amazed me was of scariest thrilling ones have ever seen
a terrific horror/suspense film . jack is genius in this movie
best horror movie ever ! still creeps me out and i've seen it a hundred times .
excellent storyline and idea that turned into another classic . ive never read the book , so i am not comparing two together this movie definetely has some really good scenes scene with blood in hallway freaks me out every time see it !
very good.it does a well job at being scary .
if you ask me thier aint nothin more scary then little dead kids . jack does great like he always
here's johnny! ! now this movie excels beyond all other horror movies . is a classic jack nicholson great actor who can play many different roles he was in from start to finish at first it seemed that just typical father , yet changed so cleverly and quickly into raging axe murderer trying redrum...i mean murder his wife son don't mess with cause work no makes him dull boy
great #1 pick , guys ! fantastically underrated movie . top 25...ever possibly
without a doubt , one of the best horror movies all time that is if you want to call it . shining only kubrick movie i've seen and has enticed me see many more his work casting could not have been any better for this film nicholson shines (no pun intended) as psychopathic keeper overlook hotel good stuff indeed !
kubrick is awesome!!!! ! nicholson too!!!!
this is a creepy and suspenseful movie , especially at night . it teases you when looks like something surprising about to happen but doesn't builds up suspense jack nicholson amazing as psycho !
omg!! ! jack here's johnny nicholson is awesome in this . i saw when was about 13 and very scared , especially since lived denver then can not watch film alone cause get the only thing that regret to say movie it a lot like stephen king novel had once read an article he disappointed w/ because so unlike his book but. great anyway
my fav . horror movie of all time! ! this has facinated me since i was a kid never forgot the scene where jack takes axe to bathroom door! love flick!
what do you when jack goes mad ? truly one of the foundations horror today . this movie is well , monumentary amazing performance by nicholson who plays a winter caretaker overlook hotel slowly turns throughout to point trying kill his family staying at with him for its great see jack's acting ability shine as watch madness possess mind until he into beast climax in most memorable chase scenes history scince from stanley kubrick director clockwork orange know that it promises be visualy stunning must any true fans out there
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen , let alone horror . watched movie so many times memorized almost every line but thing that makes me want to watch over and again jack nicholson...his expressions are hilarious ! his acting second-to-none...one my favorite actors proves a doesn't blood guts all other good stuff be scary think idea being locked in hotel with lunatic father who was going murder mother an ax chop us into little pieces enough outstanding believe it not only film all-time also
kubrick seems to be very good at suspense , and the mental torture of characters is fantastic . scene that always sticks in my mind when you have huge wave blood crashing down corridor an excellent film with brilliant acting
this movie has a good plot , kinda similar to the fugitive . ashley judd is great in her part she's beautiful and caring but strong independent as well little cheesy at end still very exciting entertaining
madness can be brutal . especially in the hands of god or kubrick as most call him this is his only true horror film not since halloween friday 13th but a dealing with frailty mind and age old precsence evil.jack on scary sob i think timeless epic it will cherished classic for years to come thank you !
i was so appalled by this movie because jack nicholson is my favorite actor . he did such a great job with really enjoyed the whole plot of , and thought house doing to caretaker kind eerie
this movie is the most scariest ever . it was innovative director really knew how to scare people dialogue terrific , and so acting special effects were advanced for time made dead person in tub fun
this movie is the epitomy of all horrors . jack nicholson shows his acting ability immensely and brings it to a new level i rank as top 5 horror time
this is a great movie . i consider it classic trippy special effects scared the hell outta me , couldn't sleep for awhile especially in dark
this is #1 on my list ! those two little girls still scare the hell out of me...and i'm 30 now
the scariest movie i have ever seen by far . jack nicholson is unbelievable in this film redrum a line that will stick my head forever
the book was magnificent!! ! i almost cried at part where jack nicholson said no honey , don't want to hurt you just smash your f-ckin' face in that means a lot me .
the shining (1980) is simply one of greatest horror movies . kubrick did a phenomenal job at creating very frightening movie i don't care what king says -- this fantastic camera angles were spooky.. and course jack nicholson great dialogue with ghost bartender lots moments that will make your hairs stand.. come play us danny !
a great scary movie . one of the classics that everyone should see
a great suspense\horror film that keeps you on the edge of your seat whole time . jack nicholson is superb his performance so convincing there's just right amount blood and guts balanced with an intelligent , original plot
this was the scariest movie i've ever seen . i don't know if it age that saw at (14) , or uncanny ability of jack nicholson to play a psychopath mixing reality horror with surreal but scared bejesus out me
well , i seem to have missed a lot of it because was at party and there lava lamp next the tv (very distracting!) but by time he jumped that driver guy w/ ax really into that's only part in any movie made me scream.. .
i think that the shining is one of greatest horror movies i've seen . simpsons' references to it add its greatness
you won't come to any introspective revelations because of this film , but it is a rollercoaster surprising action . really get drawn into the plight much wronged mother and run with her on race ultimate revenge ashley judd beautiful convincing
the possessed voice kinda rules . demonic stuff is so much better than slasher flicks , which i file under comedy "the power of christ compels you!"
this is the scariest movie ever . most people confuse being "terrified" with "startled" --true terror harder to accomplish while it easy startle someone a sudden blast of music or something jumping out at you exorcist made think and there are subtle points in that still haunt me years later two terrifying scenes : father karras room "it" hears familiar voice say "can ya spare quarter for an old altar boy father?" --it was subway beginning when about board train other scene enters seems his dead mother sitting on bed staring him brightly lit come on!! ! no halloween comes even close stuff!! rest movies list relatively simple-minded
the voices send a chill up and down your spine . power of devil is always great movie theme
it was extreemly scarey , and the main reason behind is that there no soundtrack . banned in my country for quite a while (years)! but still scares me 
very scary
it might seem a little tame to newer generation of filmgoers that grew up on more sophisticated special effects , but when came out this movie was one the scariest movies ever . still holds
the benchmark for all horror films , past present and future . a classic
one of the top horror movies all time.i was scared to death after watching it when i a kid . her head spinning around freaks you out
the greatness of film , for me is demonstrated by fact that i'm not religious i find premise absurd (john landis made comment and paraphrase 12-year old girl gets possessed devil goes to pedophile priests assistance?) yet still love it . stars great ellen burstyn max von sydow even non-actor (playwright) jason miller effective greatest all course make-up dick smith despite advances in special effects have been years since 1973 this creation has never matched terms sheer chilling creepiness kind no-holds barred movie they just don't make anymore unfortunately can you imagine anyone putting a scene like one with linda blair crucifix today ? put up against pitiful pseudo-exorcist came out last year you'll see how markedly state moviemaking deteriorated over past 20-30
the queen mother of all horror movies .
this movie freaked me out . linda blair did an amazing job , no wonder she had to go into therapy after that the effects are very good considering is from 70's i was disgusted at times but think movies one of best decade if you don't like horror might want skip cause will freak your
almost scared me !
the scarriest , therefore best .
i loved this movie from the start to end . it was suspensful and kept me at edge of my seat leading actress , ashley judd hate her husband an excellent
in my opinion , the best horror movie ever made . at time - great shock value today overall atmosphere and as creepy they come book is a fascinating read too
there is nit enough stars in the night sky to rate this movie . pure horror and i know
the ultimate horror movie......... .
one of the best movies all time . horror just builds and a great story that was particularly well acted
anything i could possibly say about this movie would be a gross understatement . is the definition of horror if you want to scared and disturbed ones for
will always be a horror classic . probably scared more people than any other movie in history watching it on cable tv doesn't do justice , because has been cut jamie halloween watch the unedited version late at night if you haven't seen
great plot and ashley judd rocks . it was very intense with action scenes the characters story keep you guessing good ending
one of the scarriest movies all time! ! it makes you think and it's a great conversation topic!!!
anyone who rated this a 1 , does not understand the concept of good vs . evil to human standpoint little girl isn't monster or even demon she is freaking devil himself!! ! definetly scariest movie all time i can't watch it by myself day
if a horror movie is able install within you an errie persence and surprise throughout the picture , it has accomplished its main purpose . exorcist prime example of what good should be also helps that picutre reasonable or dare i say plot brilliant acting (which emcompassed inside exorcist) film mesmorizing all way through only few can hold candle to this great classic
as a catholic this is very disturbing movie.it scary in frightening gotcha way and psychologically.this makes you think examine your beliefs.much like jaws scared people out of the water,this movie into church.this has to rank one greatest movies all time.i have many friends who will not watch  .
the scarest film of all time and i've saw them
this movie is about everything - life after death , belief in heaven and hell the breakdown 60s 70s of american family effect puberty on a child parent loss faith christianity's beginnings (the beginning sequence middle east wonderful kubrickian omen that evil coming like old traditions are cursing values west) what medicine doesn't know brain perhaps most disturbing sexuality pubescent . i think that's one bothers people i'm stunned so much taboo went into it's an amazing it still makes me very uneasy to watch
a classic in it's time , this movie had everything . however nowadays people who are seeing it for the first find *boring* after all they have been raised on jason freddy and micheal
the best horror film ever . easily great acting ; directing thrills chills
this movie is a strange part of my life . when i was five and staying with relatives , came on supposed to be in bed sleeping but the staircase watching through posts bannister pretty obvious word advice is- don't let anyone under age 16 see as seriously had horrible nightmares problems at night for good ten years afterwords it affected me so much that became facsinated religion behind exorcist studied babylonian college demon possesed regan really existed pantheon- it's called pazuzu known god foul south wind brought disease pestlilence there even statue british museum comments everyone else has made here say all- by far most disturbing unsettling ever can have deep psychological impact person personally attest book excellent well worth read re-read
this is only one horror movie that scares me and i refuse to watch it .
the best horror movie , and one of movies all time . represents a true test faith it illustrates most constant battles in life -- vs science
thought it was very well written and i believe a lot of these things can happen in real life , so that made extremely thought-provoking as frightening . actors were great - linda blair's best role ellen burstyn is always the
best scary movie ever...bar none .
the classic horror movie , exorcist was completely revolutionary when it came out and set a new standard in evolution of . how many movies before or since have had audiences running from cinema screaming terror ? unlike weak films 80s 90s doesn't rely on blood murders axes psychos close up graphic shots mutilation fear is battle between good represented by tired doubting priest ultimate evil coming cute innocent young girl first few times i saw indeed frightening now looks somewhat dated not surprising considering produced so long ago but even can hold as one top all time forget sequels though they were dreadul !
the exorcist is absolutely one of greatest films all times.and it's not just because scariest film ever made , but so perfect performances are realistic and story scary explicit brilliant . turn off lights up sound enjoy forever..
the exorcist is , definitly one of most fantastic films i've ever seen . faith in devil and to someone can chase away him its resolute presentation strange fenomenon strong lenguaje be a frightful experience but trip through long dark soul's night relates mighty message courage desire face inexplicable forces apparently out our control 
hmmm...now what to say about this movie that hasn't been said before ? of all the movies , horror or otherwise have made since...well since they started making movies...this has be right up there alongside citizen kane as one most talked debated and analyzed . why my guess is it's because those rare films strikes individual viewers with such diverse personal resonances for some painful watch others it an uplifting affirmation deeply held faith people laugh at cry director william friedkin you get from film subconsciously bring when see very few remain unaffected by better worse who don't know (all 10 you) based author peter blatty (who wrote both screenplay novel upon which based)on a true account exorcism young boy in mt ranier around 1948 centers eleven year old regan macneill (linda blair) apparently become object attention rather nasty demonic presence progressively begins take control causing increasingly bizarre violent behavior eventually little girl transformed into hideous malevolent monster speaks gutteral baritone no could possibly produce (but veteran actress mercedes mccambridge can...and did.) needs strapped her bed hospital restraints scenes where we first are unnerving terrible knowledge luminous green eyes shouldn't after every possible diagnostic test (the was 1973--medicine thankfully come long way then--and these involving needles jugular vein exceptionally hard watch.)fails show any abnormality regan's desperate agnostic mother chris (ellyn burstyn academy award nominated performance)turns priest father karras (jason miller) skeptical doubting his own god determines whether not truly possessed she help aid guidance older more experienced merrin (max von sydow) may actually confronted same demon many years he undertakes drive out personality inhabiting body evoked brilliantly physically ugly but under surface causes real damage unerring ability sense weakness fear preys things suggests nature evil works so much through insult mockery holds passionately sacred subtle suggestion our actions harmed love hold dear loved ones themselves probably basically unworthy will suffer eternally end remains ugliness futility mindless chaos itself comprises roughly last twenty minutes riveting emotionally vision abyss between doubt orderly comfortably modern church ancient seems ill prepared confront innocence stripped violently away child fault chosen answers question makes none them easy comfortable i recommend couple cautions : children visual verbal content strong enough think takes mature sensibility put perspective might able do overwhelming even traumatic also prospective viewer should forewarned--the quite graphic extreme profanity while familiar used throughout blasphemous irreligious feelings on subject well shocked further onscreen depictions vomiting urination masturbation upsetting lot especially context twenty-fifth anniversary edition dvd exorcist contains amongst other documentary titled  originally shot bbc features interesting information interviews cast crew vhs version though somewhat edited available never saw 2000 theatrical re-release picture twelve footage cut digital effects if like you'll find adds anything significant experience
scary
the scariest film ever made
the exorcist was a terrific movie
this is the scariest movie of all time because it deals with someone mankind cannot control : a diversified , dimensional darkness and that enough to scare crap out me
this is the all time horror movie of horrors ! it about a relm in which we either disagree and agree to whether exists or not . child being possessed by demon? how unearthly can get also based on real live true stroy i dont know facts , but that me tell little something demons earth powerful darkside really be linda blair had some definate big ones do such role couldnt honest-----does work way says does?? ? rent whatever you have must see (especially since halloween its way)
this has got to be the best comedy of all time . its absolutely hilarious if you want have an awesome night at your house , rent movie funny stuff
imagine going to catholic school for twelve years , being a senior in an all boys high and after that religious indoctrination you see the exorcist!! ! four of us went westwood calif . on rain misty night we stood line over two hours just buy tickets another get theater rapped around block twice building was window with curtains blowing outward people were handing out flyers saying what happened regan could happen you! once inside my best friend i got off center front row seats sound picture right our face kid not when exorcist walks house roaring scream maaarinnnn!!!! blares rose hovered seat at least seven seconds!! couldn't sleep curses loud noises bothered me next day principle brother(i taught by nuns priests brothers) asked why looked so pail tole him he read begone satan true story exorcism didn't help.what head trip this film is psychological horror will beat slasher anytime
ok i have just seen this movie recently for the first time w/ my fren.....and ta say that think is best horror film of all ! thought every1 in acted very well....i mean would never ever play a role like or nething it....lol...but it was good....i started freakin out when she did lil spider walk down stairs...ahhhhh soooooo scary...kinda..well so..hehe...and o mi goodness her head turned and green throw-up...totally gross...but way kool  ; ) umm...i dont ne other can top one...it perfect film....oh im gettin goosebumps talkin bout it...so goin to end opinion...hehe bye all!! :o)
this is the scariest movie i have ever seen ! it gave me nightmares , as a kid for 10 yrs never forgot one and infamous crucifix scene limitted edition box set love new release great classic!
ever wonder why the exorcist is always at top of every horror movie list ? thats not an accident . this well , argumentivly best made william peter blatty really did his homework on and friedkin unbelievably amazing job taking it off paper screen my hats to both you story ordinary innocent child possesed trials tribulations driving evil out one creepest movies i have seen as thorne said shows us how completely vulnerable we are if haven't don't see re-released version ending sucks original that leaves wondering good triumph over or was other way around astonishing performances by ellen burstyn linda blair whole cast blew me away with their terrific god all religious made(i can't believe lost souls even tried pretend they werein same league exorcist) will definately keep your eyes glued yo a for genarations guaruntee never die.this classic
what a thoroughly brilliant and creepy movie . it's rare that i find in which can become totally engrossed the exorcist definently held my attention occult itself has always , some way interested me it was portrayed here simply fascinating there this unexpected mix of unadulterated fright an eerie sort thoughtfulness silent at movie's end you say ? how so well one can't really ignore powerful symbolic image young girl once innocent unaffected by outside goings-on world being overcome with pure complete evil she seethed it(due part im sure to wonderful performance linda blair) had flowing through every self inflicted cut slow purposeful outake breath.the beginning but believe too very executed those early moments is filled sense suspense
what a powerful film . the handeling of this very strong religiouse subject matter was done with impecable taste movie takes its self seriously through and believable modern fable love,possesion,faith loss of,family,the horrors that dwell deep within each every one us will chill even most unchillable to core isn't kind scary teeny boppers are used tell you truth it might quit probably wouldn't scare them at all is horror for those who take time feel realize how completely vulnerable we actually do not see new version  ! make sure original good ending fits leaves up audience decide if evil concord or other way around ? classic only our directors today would viewing , sit back storytelling,character developement atmosphere great movies blood guts tits ass highly recommended true fan in general haven't seen truely remarkable yourself favor
soooo scary . i was about 25 when first saw this and that shaken went home slept with the lights on after checking under bed like a liitle kid ! best horror movie of all time
the exorcist is by far one of greatest films all time . it chilling and at times a bit disturbing movie has an extremly well done screenplay cast plays their roles respectfully , nicely regan macneil 12-year old girl who having some problems she always seems to be doing crazy things like throwing up making messes cursing her mother doctors are stumped but not being possessed devil only hope exorcisum they call upon father marrin works
i have this on dvd and it really creeps me out . especially with the demon's voice think would been scarier if they had kept spider walk going down stairs - now that freaked !
hands down the most horrifying and convincing movie of all time . acting was superb by both mother daughter topic realistic characters really brought it to life that it's just plain scary why is sixth sense above again ?
this was one of the first horror movies i saw . really scared when watched movie got a thumbs up from me !
now here's a horror movie . this can give you nightmares for the rest of your life know it's scary when won't dare show kids if wasn't good it wouldn't be legend by everyone knows about and everyone's seen i would an a+ scariness
this is my favorite movie of all time , because it's the only that ever scared me ! for period it was made still a great horror flick today scene when girl possesed and sleeping her mom comes in to see on stomach scratched help  . most disgusting parts are throw-up where she stabs private with upside down cross rubs mom's face but i loved
scariest movie of all time ! they are making a new one and i want to see it .
this is a drama about woman whose husband tries to frame her for his own death . i was glued the screen of what going happen next and will she ever get justice an excellent film enjoy movies with ashly judd tommy lee jones
a classic film that was revolutionary . this , although older than me scared to death and i amazed art how good
only the greatest horror film ever . linda blair did a great job portraying girl possesed by devil it is really scary because seems so real
this movie scared the crap out of me! ! especially since it was a true story , i really captivated by .
exorcist i ii are highly recommended if you really want to get scared . they show good effects and most of the visuals so scary , that's what makes it realistic recommend this movie all my friends is an around background music worth watching over again
this is a great movie . it has good story and scary as hell
the movie was scary . i couldn't sleep for weeks they made that real makeup sooo great posessed girl looked
the scariest freaking movie of all time . i couldn't sleep in my bed for three days because s.o.b was shaking so bad too realistic to watch alone at night by yourself
this movie was soooo scary . it scared me ; for three weeks i had nightmares but being a horror think the best i've ever seen
this movie was totally good . i say because it really scared the crap out of me seemed so real
the scariest movie of all time . everything about it was scary! ! posessed girl's face still haunts me make-up job superb
this movie scared me at the age of ten and it still scares 20+ . it's a classic
this is the greatest horror film . it was weird and devilish anytime you have devil like movies freaks me out i had to stop videotape when got scared
it doesn't matter that this movie was released in the early '70s . still terrifies exorcist is most offensive i've ever seen mainstream if you haven't newly restored version with added 11 minutes , then ain't nothin' yet !
the best horror movie ever ! very scary , visual effects are excellent . storyline makes good
hands down the best horror film of all time . it is a smart scary movie , one which gets into your mind instead just getting you to jump here and there this will linger with for long i still get chills when hear theme music
i love ashley judd-so loved this movie . the woman is a wonderful actress and to put it in tommy lee jones was superb
this movie definitely disturbed me (not as frightening reading the book though) . is a timeless horror flick no matter what new special effects come out , exorcist will always be horrifying it plays more on you mind that blatant blood and guts of so many movies i hear based true story which makes even freaky
if a horror film is supposed to scare the be jesus (sp?) out of people then this one helluva . i hate movies , 'em partly because think they're usually kinda cheesey and because,..well 'cause scary but really must've seen when was about 10 or so it totally freaked me
yeah , this movie is starting to look dated but when it gets started will shock u and gross out like a horror should  ! the grand-daddy of em all if are looking for cheap slasher film that jolts with silly gory f/x don't bother watching one . want an intelligent mature kinda deep check everyone has uttered line i watched didn't scare me at forget tremendous hype spoken about rewatch judge then you might change your opinion still prefer friday 13th well.....today perfect day exorcism...
yikes !!! !
i had nightmares for a whole week after watching this movie . if there is any part of you that believes in religion , evil or the existence other forms spirits will be very entertaining it's realistic-no freddy krueger's jason's more psychological thriller questions your belief whether can exist and effect us faith save
scared the hell out me !
real scary! ! one of the best horror movies .
i was the carrie white of my high school a misfit hated by jocks and chearleaders yuppies movie very real creepy
one of the greatest movies around.. . if you are a fan horror there is no way can denie this movie , king master!! !
i love it , especially the ending
a great phychological thriller . i was never terrorized or scarred by it carrie came across to me as figure be pittied , not scared of what is scary that there are people who would treat like way carrie's mother propably the most scarry person in movie if only because their out
i really found this movie entertaining.sissy spacek is a great actress . loved how she got revenge on all the students at prom id love to have powers that has anyone seen updated version of carrie ?
i love carrie . however , am disturbed by what she had to go through white is a tormented and made fun of high school girl people throw tampons at her the walls are spray painted with nasty words eats sh*t ! no one seems even care that this being unfairly treated not girl's mother unbeknownst them has telekinesis basically in simpler she's going kill they're die very gory death like about film it does justify or promote tormenters do every bad thing characters come back haunt unfortunatley most suffer hands but way we can't really blame gets viciously abused home thrown coffee on shoved pelted told eat day so it's wonder why strikes these ruthless tormentors may be right can sympathize for hell endured
one of the best horror movies ever . mom is scariest figures in movie history
carrie was the first horror film i ever saw and still think,despite it`s age that it is ultimate shocker has good direction,a great cast some of shock moments in all . also one horrors best scores written by pino donaggio playing throughout unmissable....
what a great movie...sissy spacek as the confused and tortured carrie was haunting...and rage at end scary you can get...and piper laurie her fanatical religious mother unforgettable . horror movie with message...isn't that unusual..
i loved it because thought sissy is a great actress.she was like me when 16.i never went to my prom.all the populer kids hatted .
this was a scary movie . in the era of slasher films friday 13th and halloween carrie deeper film which main character is both good bad your scared her yet also feel really sorry for hard to do with jason or mike myers had depth still best steven king version one his novels bar none very use lighting atomsphere me two images stay prom scene course but much more frightening were closet scenes cruifix jesus glowing eyes creepy
the best horror flick i've ever seen .
it's such a great film , especially the ending !
brian de palma`s carrie  , still remains as one of the most unforgettable and enduring horror films ever made . this harrowing chilling riveting movie takes a look at very popular subject ; adolescent cruelty white (sissy spacek) is withdrawn sexually repressed misfit who also possesses psychic powers famous prom scene electrifying but it final between her mother that will both disturb haunt you distinctive film combines tragic poignancy creating genuinely good should be watched again again.just shapes opinion
this film is not only a brilliant horror movie but with message . alot of films just go for the cut em up splash blood on drapes sort scare carrie however does she brings us lesson we all can identify also those who treat like crap need to learn everyone respect no matter how odd they might appear it good karma that person could trap you inside your senior prom and burn alive delivere death mayhem whos soul purpose watching gore nudity care dig deeper there much more than meets eye
this movie is scary because when everyone was in high school knew that there were people exactly like . i think that's why most teens are cool with you don't know how these
i was surprised to find that this movie is even better than stephen king's book . but recommend it (the book) as well one of brian de palma's best! !
this was scary , perhaps because her mother so psycho or maybe sissy spacek just has a freaky face . i think it fulfilling we always hope could fight back like carrie and also know we've all treated someone badly the people
it kills me every time i see it...she's so happy , and you that bucket of pigs' blood--you know it's going to come down on her but wish wouldn't..but then wouldn't be the classic horror movie is ! nasty mother frightening enough all by herself..and can't beat performances sissy john travolta greatest american hero guy!
carrie and all other steven king movies are the best horror flicks .
carrie is my favorite horror movie of all time!! !
real horror,especially since this is the type of situation that really could happen.kathy bates brilliant as an insane and obsessed fan from hell in well made film.it also noteworthy for role-reversal usual psyhco/victim genders .
most horror movies are way too.. . unbelievable (literally) this movie was great because it could actually happen in real life unlike thriller flicks kathy bates couldn't have done a better job at being pyscho bitch
terrific movie......i would like to have michael douglas for a one night stand!!! !
i kept my eyes closed 30% of the time . it was scary and gross at times
very good and creepy movie . this is one of those things that could definately happen in real life bates does a great job playing crazy woman caan well at looking truely scared
loved the book and was so glad to see that movie equally enjoyable . kathy bates did a terrific job portraying annie
what a bitch ! if it were me when all was done and overwith i would've tortured the hell out of her .
this is one of the best movies ! kathy bates was great it a crazy movie
this is one of the few sk movies i really liked . great story and excellent acting kathy bates was magnificent deserved that oscar
perfect performances by douglas , close and anne archer . michael is an excellent actor he always plays these characters where you don't know whether to root for him or hate my friend i talk about the fact why dan would have affair when his wife gorgeous sweet woman looks like a drag queen compared her but hey does anyone affairs ? awesome movie though !! !
one of stephen king's best translations to screen ever . i don't generally care for his movies , especially the miniseries however this is a true gem kathy bates terrifyingly real in her portrayal psychopath and kahn excellently portrays emotions man caught helpless evidently hopeless situation movie doesn't contain large amounts blood or gore but has very realistic believable quality it definitely makes my list
another one of the best horror flicks ! i enjoyed this movie very much . kathy bates did an incredible job as freak woman loved little names that she called everyone too
misery is one movie that you can't miss to see . rob reiner knew what do here , and who pick get the job done kathy bates plays a woman obsessed with this author when he gets into an accident she takes him in but very sick her mind sometimes goes overboard starts abusing axe
bravo , kathy bates
this movie is a classic , at least compared to horror flicks now .
a must-see for all men whom have wondering eye ! glenn close is phenominal .
kathy bates gives a flawless performance in this one . of the better adaptations stephen king novel
i loved this movie . it wasn't so much scary was suspenseful and funny annie lockadoodie paper that's my favorite line a lunatic
i enjoy all books by stephen king . this is about an infatuated fan who kidnaps author and tries to influence his next book
i really like misery . yes guess you could consider it a horror film but think if more as thriller with some horrible bits in of hitchcock-esque sort not all blood and guts drawn out oh my god how awful kind draws into his situation helpless he becomes fearful at the same time totally dependent
kathy bates made this a masterpiece  !
one of the rare instances when a movie is actually better than novel . kathy bates phenominal in this , as she all movies and i was truly surprised it worked so well
one of the best suspense movies out there . i love atmosphere this film and kathy bates , amazing very good suspense/horror - my favorites reat book too (by stephen king) it's also although prefer film's ending rather than book's rules
misery is about a nurse who has craziness and selfishness . the scary part of this movie story how camera focusses on nurse's mind-illness shows her hidden caused by well-done since not only scares audience showing brutal characteristics , but also let think could be crazy or psychological problems
misery is a well-written , well-acted psychological thriller . it horror movie in the sense that if you found yourself this kind of situation would be kathy bates won an oscar for so know she does convincing job as mentally disturbed fan there's not much blood or gore but very entertaining because reality
bayst
kathy bates was phenomenal ! she amazing as a psychotic woman . stephen king's movie about his original story excellent at portraying novel king continues to show us disturbing , but real stories that always bring fear the observer
i've seen this movie many times . the whole idea of a crazy fan is very realistic and scary i really like kathy bates too she's pretty by herself
kathy bates was really convincing! ! that film is scary because it's close to reality .
a classic , creepy disturbing movie . the music at beginning when they are in cemetery corpses grabbing pieces of body out truck it explodes that is just terrifying beyond belief acting awful and over top but part movie's charm
the zombie movie . no one will ever come close to making another flick that can draw you in like this i read on some other posts was funny or boring , but htey obviously either paid attention were high watching dreadful remake sequels
george romero is the best zombie director of all time . even though this movie old and out date , i would watch it over almost everytime comes on with black white format just so much more scary should say creepy because its not really creep factor that makes fun
a horror classic .
the exploding truck scene ! loved it
a classic , and inspired by my 2nd favorite horror film of all time - carnival souls (1962) . or so george romero writer/director night the living dead says
which one ? 1990 or 1964 they both were great . who does not like dead corpses walking around it is an inspiration to most of the greatest movie now
this has to be one of the scariest movie s i've ever seen . george romero established himself as king dead with many scenes that make you want just cover your eyes , a very good surprise at end definite must see
a gorefest in places with canibalistic behavior . disturbing , visually dark and gruesome being black & white just adds to the creepy atmosphere true classic among horror buffs if you love be scared see it uncut
excellent movie simply amazing
this is such a great film . i it's my second favourite horror ever after halloween
by far my favorite horror film . i love the grainy black and white , methodical destruction of all characters central metaphor has been interpreted (and over-interpreted) many ways --but to me it is about deadening mindless conformity devouring everything alive
the walking dead taking over town and trying to get at living eat them , scary stuff . whole borded up windows think of a plan out there situation  by givin options going into basement or staying upstairs just flat running i personally would have went in attic but hey that is me cool movie it worth 5 stars
that is so wonderful!!!! !
the first of 4 movies andthe scariest.shot in black and white on a shoestring budget.the tension inside house gets thick enuff to cut with knife.the dead come back feed living group strangers try lock themselves into farmhouse.this was remade color several years later remake isn't bad.the second series is must see  .
absolute classic . it used to come on late at night a fri or sat when i was kid in chicago scare the bejeezus out of me it's not effects , acting technicalities etc that get you - how all works camera angles pacing prevalent darkness sense something horrible has happened due documentary style (like nuclear apocalypse occurred) realistic tv newscast interplay characters and fact this is 1st zombie movie romero's first (amazing) plus racial overtones heart-breaking ending then scary music end fantastic ! but you'd have see an impressionable age
a classic and scary
like i said with the evil dead every one in seris is sh@t .
an absolute horror classic ! one of the best endings for a movie . so devastating when ben dies! aargh!!
i love this movie ! it is soo wonderful . my 2nd fav in the george a romero zombie movies have seen 56 times before
the shape says that george romero made his directorial debut with this film , a low-budget b-movie would go on to become classic hailed by all connaisseurs of horror . although famous for its gore and ruthlessness is far more accessible than romero's later films seventies such as martin dawn dead said rapid editing early effects are combined give claustrophobic unrelenting portrait seven survivor's attempts escape clutches seemingly endless crowds undead greatest (closely followed masterpiece martin) highly influencial partlicularly amoungst cult work was influence many other directors including italian icons john carpenter what essentially an independant acting not too bad script superb - both believable endlessly quotable scenes look out include scene where zombie set fire (done without protection course) dozens hands break through window grab at our heros actually entire end sequence utterly terrifying first time movie in reality (relatively speaking) totally compelling absolute must-see horror-buffs even if you don't like great ya smellllll la la....what shape....is cookin! !
what can i say , this is a classic and the grandfather of modern zombie films . you know living dead aren't for everyone personally like idea first great ! coming back to eat they out number us either stop killing or lose war night was well thought written horror movie its time george romero very smart when it comes writting movies from scientific point view as human every character just about has real feel them neighbor an aquantence at school proved be bankable expandable psycho genre highly recommended absolute
this is another classic . even though it was kinda' cheesy , i liked the makeup of zombies one best horror movies i've ever seen it's those that you just gotta buy to see over and again
no gore , vulgarity green pea soap . a nightmare captured on celluloid and i think polanski's best film
no gore , violence - yet one of the scariest movies made !
this movie was so ahead of its time . no special effects and slice n dice , just pure suspense i still get the creeps when watch it
the buildup of dread makes this a great film . if you expect slash and splatter , stay away !
please ignore the morons before me who give this one star . is a great movie yes , it slow no definitely not dull builds creepy i rented from library never having heard of was glued opening credits polanski didn't equal effort again until recent excellent pianist
gets better every time i seeit . only movie where can tolerate mia farrow her line what have you done with his eyes ? haunts me for some reason love the is she paranoid are they a coven plotting against just mental pregnancy affecting having crisis of faith marriage really worth it how much should we know our neighbors question doctors do people succeed in life and others fail because secret covenant religion nothing more than an approved form society woman's greatest , never answered does mother when she's raising horror far will go to protect last most profound one that this asks chock full images dialogue symbols all these things like polanski integrated seasons ny into plot - seasonal thing so subtle u don't realize spans 9 months all-time great richer deeper simply
excellent actors and a very unusual plot storyline which keeps you glued to it .
rosemary's baby is terrific . mia farrow was great
love those psychological thrillers . this is another of my favorite all-time horror films
one of the greatest horror films i have ever seen . it relys solely on what you don't see , which love not gore and eye candy rosemary's baby is story a young newly wed woman named...you guessed it!...rosemary now she seems to be living good life with her actor hausband at first but before long some elderly neighbors start pushing themselves into married couples lives these their friends aren't just annoying they deadly secret that husband as well rosemary are become intricate peices so unborn child ! suspence,suspicion chills along beautiful filmmaking wonderful acting great telling holds this very creepy goosebump inducing movie work hold up in stratosphere other two greats satanic trilogy exorcist,the omen and...rosemary's ride pure suspence highly recommended film
rosemary's baby has to be the scariest movie of all time . there's no blood or gore , just pure psychological terror that builds within mind main character rosemary woodhouse as she uncovers a plot have her unborn child stolen by group devil worshippers this is one horror breaks away from freddy kruger/michael myers/texas chainsaw massacre mould and classic in its own right try not expect too much regards flying limbs heads being chopped off i guarantee you won't disappointed !
roman polanski's 1968 film version of ira levin's novel rosemary's baby takes a clever little shaggy-dog tale type horror and turns it into an exercise in paranoia . unsuccessful actor guy woodhouse his wife rosemary move the bramford , large old apartment building based upon ( filmed exteriorly at-)the dakota new york city same outside which john lennon was killed decades later neigbors all apparently elderly way too friendly work their young couple's lives qickly following apparent suicide woman living with couple next : castavets (ruth gordon who won oscar sidney blackmer) weird events quickly follow including very realistic dream has she is raped by inhuman creature thereafter discovers pregnant comes to suspect... leisurely builds suspense through character development viewpoint entirely subjective viewer every scene we learn what going on along her suspicions become ours about fear being alone violation unspecified but real abnormal pregnancy also faith if satan after place then must make our personal view universe for notion god ? direction makes this implicit coming at edge viewer's consciousness catching hold notice where skeletal tormented painful grip doesn't understand come pauses look manger window department store sees superimposed over religious imagery own reflection looking gaunt horrible see realization face--she recognizes true effect situation having suddenly minnie castavet bursts awy from contemplation sense profane turning victim away sacred not popular word relies atmosphere as well style explores issues evil it's ambiguous open ending leaves room speculation yes even hope
i watched this my senior year in high school , and the movie came out 1961 . is very good i'd recommend it disturbing dealing with devil all a woman carrying it's baby
kept you on the edge . didn't know what was going to happen surprise element classic great characters which i got into mia farrow as victim
one of the first classy intellectual horror movies , holds up very well  !
i will always love this version the best it was so bloody for its time
george does it again!!! ! you cannot have a zombie movie without romero . ok , maybe some but not the originals romero's unholy trilogy (that's night dawn and day of course) are by far best even latest installment dissatisfy shopping mall was ingenius thinking who wouldn't go running to when your next door neighbor or live-in tries eat brains ? classic!
this is one of my favorite movies all time . it started off zombie craze the newer version dawn dead may have more action and special effects , but lacks awesome mood environment present in original as well its underlying message characters are also better developed opinion there great dark humor theatrical release if you can get director's cut because sets movie up includes some scenes that seem sort integral to film once seen both releases was exciting well-done ; i like too can't be beat george a romero made masterpiece when he
classic camp horror . maybe not the scariest but perhaps funniest movie scene where two hunters are picking off zombies is hilarious
name another film with free hard candy,a one legged priest and buckets of room temperature sheep entrails..i mean,besides the scat porn shot at dick martins palatial mansion.the dead walk start sinking their teeth into anything that moves (except harry careys bowels).the only way this could have been more terrifying is if helicopter had landed on a zayres.remember two main rules for dealing undead:shoot them in head come in...grab gun (*must be said canned staccato western amusement park voice)
greatest zombie movie of them all . if not one the movies period plus my wife hates this thats why i know its good
original : amazing . one of the best zombie movies ever made remake pretty good in its own way i would give it 2.5 stars
hmm..think ill watch it ^^
this movie is hardcore . heads were blown off , zombies up and they shot a baby in the face its all topped with some frontal nudity it greatest zombie related ever what resident evil should have been
just saw the newest version of this movie and i loved it!!!!!!!! ! it's scarry as hell! zombies move faster than humans , which makes you freak out more . think what if it really happened?? ?
how can you not love this movie ! i have seen it 72 times and think is wonderful . has all of the qualifacations for a horror/zombie really cool plenty gore too
dawn of the dead is crown jewel george romero's 'dead' trilogy . whereas night living was a fun , campy and almost comical flick much more insidious unlike nold where story or less confined to those trapped in farmhouse we see zombie plague - accompanying panic spread like wildfire across country first few scenes from there takes viewers on journey main characters seek refuge flesh eating rampage deserted shopping mall attempt ward off intrusion monsters by building barracades but eventually lose when an army looters targets their fortress blasts open entrances has it's share gore special effects although i find it be thriller type movie than pure horror well done ! remains one my favourite movies all time
finally the shape has come back to review dawn of dead --- mention someone that you like horror films and chances are , they'll roll their eyes . some extent who could blame them ? we've had countless killers wiping out legions co-eds campers party-hearty types etc a lot blood been shed usually in movies with basically no plot almost always not shred decent acting by-the-numbers fashion concentrates more on gore than actually scaring audience  doesn't forget movie have stoop so low order set mood yes it's gory especially ending sequence but all opening passages introduce us plague that's turning into undead hungry for human flesh we see police officers re-killing people they've killed just minutes earlier rednecks popping zombies chugging beer television reports about religious declaring war george romero is smart enough stage these things instead endless turns battle survival as group settle inside shopping mall protect themselves from zombie army waiting outside nice realistic touch eliminates then grow bored by hour much middle part small talk chatter goes within when renegade biker decides invade it opens doors final hundreds make way indoors slowly surely finding next meal gross particularly graphic yet i didn't mind this really there's action scares any get pretty disgusting end don't hold violence against film simply being necessary at least sometimes can be effective atmosphere classic man-against-monster scenario makers realized too bad other shape,card carrying reviewer around
the best of george's living dead series . dispite what some people may think , this movie is brilliant ok would you do if world was being taken over by zombies ? could either a- hold down fort or b- get out and go to...the mall i'd to i mean have everything there food guns,a safe place sleep friends hundreds push-over that will bring endless fun taking more ask for especially like part when small town got together had almost a festival killing undead our zombie in plaid little friendly with helicopter propeller laughs really good characters my favorite not scary at all but very entertaining its an interesting way tackle zombies-taking-over-the-world definate classic
i'm a sucker for zombie movies , and this one is by far the best . real characters great acting scary zombies realistic solution to an unreal problem definitely worth it rent or buy at any price
there are only a very few but this is better than the original(the gore had me jumping like i was watching original again , just more so!)
this is one of my very favorite movies and im a big val kilmer fan . he played the role doc holliday wonderfully actually got ready for by losing enough weight to resemble hollidays appearance that himself became ill during filming in scene where collapses saloon fact had collapsed real almost was replaced
ok i could of not picked a better night to watch this movie it was thundering and lighting at no has scared me quite like one see can't poster or the box without screaming movies is extremley frightning stayed awake two whole nights after seeing very distrubing , images from flim will haunt mind for all eternity least i'll never forget them ! thought great though mean there moment that wasn't love beginning when police investagation going on it's intresting what they find during . saw before original just as also shows how tragic thing got be most horror ever but defines good 100% guarauntee make your skin crawl why even while i'm typing review my crawling getting goosebumps chills you perpare yourself eternal scarefest about frighting story you've been warned ahead time..
this movie is the best ever!! ! it has gore , its scary and everything you could want in a horror .
i loved this movie . even though it is a hollywood farse that weighted by inspired true story being the very key point kicked ass ! cinematogrophy , directing and acting along with great special effects made spectacular thrill ride read my full review : http://bradley.kicks-ass.org/blog/archives/000948.php
i loved it ! was the scariest movie ive seen in a long time .
ok like seriously i dont think anybody will ever know how much this movie made me pee my pants . it is by far the scariest have seen and probably be watch whole entire life acting was amazing might been slightly more effective if jessica biel wearing a different top but still fine didn't same critera as most modern horror movies these days do there no nudity , comedy barely any glimpse of hope some main characters die you actually feel sad ends up all herself with little farm boy that she kidnapped could potiental for second one would really ridiculously scary story ruined isn't just best its period love in when they song killing parts because makes gracefull way scarier somehow oh another thing chainsaws are im sure theres twisted person out where hurts animals or people should added special features who completly interested real decifered which black white footage at beginning end pretty part only known thomas hewitt (leatherface) not hella nobody to don't ya sound on occasion (the old fashion camera clicking something that) haunts time guys running through sheets scare crap also butcher shop cows must suck hiding your dead why absolutly everbody travis county so insane soooo crazzy wish somebody give complete down low texas chainsaw massacre thanks everyone making changed (i'll never look again)
kilmer's best performance , doc made the movie . great showdowns ; and ringo madcap wyatt cowboys !
people look at this movie and think its corny or horrible but what dont realize is the impact of it . was a true story not just another scarry if i could wouldent even rate because how do you real being killed by chainsaw ? history science fiction
by : laur this movie was scary for the first time when i saw it all myself . didn't know what to aspect in because didnt even about confuses me between real and not like black white part where police officer is showing scrachtes on walls geos down into house door opens they both sheriff camera person die shoes a little piece of leatherface man now thought until went internet find out story , found that basically based ed geins two killings his dead women am still confused think could be but then it's made up sept some parts gein wore skin victims as mask woman hanging from ceiling rate film 5-great becuase sure did trick cause true its just if can diserves big number
it was so cool i am a big fan of horror movies but this one takes all love how their is mostley killings and not talk think should be the best movie ever has suspense thrilling non stop action my favroit thanks
alright , ! i think if hear one more person say that tomas hewitt or leatherface was real this excellent movie based on some maniac in texas am gonna go a chainsaw wielding massacre myself . here s the low down kids psycho and dozen other of our favorite horror movies are almost purely ed gein don t believe me ? you have to read book deviant  which chronicles ghastly deeds not be jerk aurielle but it never ever proven ate any his victims way shape form he did however wear their skin just like huge buddy (but right about him only actually killing two people dozens others were already dead) is imagination mixed with headlines taken from stories take my word for dare find single newspaper clipping report crazed mass murderer chopping up anyone last 60 years very easy loads information even info how disgusting acts turned into pop fiction fact alone enough m saying impossible nut hacked happened sure as hell ain whole true story thing marketing tool guys stuff really maybe ll fill seats theaters oh look usually does anyway closing loved although didn least bit scary disturbing moving sad (the engagement ring thing.. ouch...) better opinion ending seemed abrupt left unresolved tensions all terrific ungodly beautiful jessica biel looked those blue jeans cowboy hat who
this was the first movie i've ever seen that made my knees shake . i think most terrifying thing about it fact based on a true story -- mean , actually happened and perp never caught disagree with kamylienne however who said loosely of serial killer ed gein all thomas hewitt (the real leatherface) not really but more like mass murderer he didn't choose his victims in way sense simply murdered whomever came along next secondly wisconsin (my home state) only proven to have killed two women technically cannibal there are few striking similarities between men (one being their rather gruesome ability sew human skin) definitely is very clever film recommend if you want come out theater trembling terror
the best of 3 even though it is supposed to be a horror i laughed that much went out and bought 2 days after seen , stiil watch now still laugh my head off was brilliant way make movie .
val kilmer's best ever role . absolutely wonderful movie would watch it again and again. i have ! highly recommend to anyone
i don't care how absurd this movie is . bruce campbell (ash) became real popular one those giving or two stars are way too serious its really amazing that of the 21 ratings , rainbowstar character only person classic a poor rating yet she praises stupid fright night go figure....and she's twice which against ria policy idiot should read rules
even better than the original .
this is bruce cambell at his best!! ! it weird how a top hollywood exec . can put together multimillion dollar movie and have flop like fish but cheap quite possibly one of the funniest movies all time!!
i love the movie ! it was entertaining and gory.it may not be really scary , but bruce cambell so much that is okay he kind of remade first ed into ed2 . his goofy lines most
its more funny then scary . still one of the coolest movies ever
scary!! !
the shape says that sam raimi's evil dead ii is less a sequel than it remake/expansion of ideas in his original 1982 low-budget shocker , movie was billed as horror but had enough elements humor to almost qualify some kind deranged comedy . works on exact same premise puts front and center turning film into raucous blood-and-guts riff three stooges (which raimi has admitted major influence work) slapstick always been based form pain violence simply takes next logical level so rather getting poked eyeballs or bopped top head la get popped out their sockets fly across room land people's mouths extreme both its gruesome detail sheer volume impossible take seriously because over-the-top ridiculous heads are lopped off with shovels hands sawed chainsaws bodies dismembered headless corpses run amok gallons blood bile spew from holes wall--yet all designed filmed lavishly cartoonish proportions lend proceedings slightly surreal quality whole an assault sense also very funny if better predecessor more daring outrageous first exceptionally well-made one idea essentially ran steam near end which made obvious how simplistic not much different stronger focus comedic aspects material raises another level,and thats say about that!!1
kurt russell carried the film very well . powers boothe was a great 'bad guy'.. maybe his best work i'm not val kilmer fan now , but i after saw sam elliot bill paxton and dana dellany were good too
can you honestly sit through this movie in its entirety and not at least laugh ass off ? it is possible ! sam raimi bruce campbell are probably the greatest actor director team of all time . one most underrated comedic actors out there man twelve times funnier than jim carrey anyway evil dead 2 almost a remake original recaps beggining minus three characters lynda becomes deadite from sequel begins film no way tries to scare viewer , maybe startle few them startles surpassed by brilliant moments beautiful array macabre classic along with rest incredible series highly,highly,recommended! trilogy swallow
this movie is more than great , it's genius . not so much spooky as funny will keep you lauging and the suprisingly catchy phrases of ash are basically a remake first evil dead  returns to same cabin in woods one my personal favorites watch with return living big donut
this movie was great ! i am a huge fan of the evil dead trilogy , and is one my favorites . just like army darkness your looking to be scared not watch hilarious.bruce campbell does it again with his liners acting bruce hero back at cabin time girlfriend he dicovers tape player plays adventure begins yet another perfect blend horror comedy sam raimi genius highly reccomend that you see guarunteed laugh riot gotcha little sucker
this is probably one of the best horror movies around . there plenty stupid , senseless gore and as many different colors blood that you could ever watch bruce campbell portrays slightly mentally disturbed character very well
this is the funnier , more expensive remake of original . campy classic !
great simply
sam raimi stumped upon a simple formula of making an unneccessary gory horror movie and adding bruce campbell to it . this one gets five because was the first really do gory-horror-comedy i couldn't stop laughing you expect be scared , but instead they treat gallons blood zombie saying i'll swallow your soul is just so unbelievable from start fininsh
great adventure flick . i didn't find it scary , as much exciting a thrill ride of film

vampires!! ! need i say more ?
a classic !
lost boys was a great movie well for old one .
i aqbsolutely adore 'lost boys' - its one of the ultimate 80's flicks and has a great cast such as keifer sutherland , dianne west corey haim feldman alex winter . music was absolutely fantastic me my sisters could sing every song word for (sad know) not to take seriously but definate horror film night !
one word kiefer
great movie . plenty of action brilliant acting , particularly from val kilmer as doc holliday with his witty remarks the only downfall would be love scenes which seem though they are in simply because had to however these few and rest is very entertaining whoever it saying clint eastwood this you've got wrong film
the lost boys has to be one of best vampire films ever made . cast is great keifer sutherland and jason patric are soundtrack it death by stereo !! !
this is another one of those movies that i am not too sure why like so much . and then look as jason patric (not now..see speed 2 ? no didn't think so) all becomes clear seriously , though movie really very enjoyable it's scary but dark baby bear's porridge : just right.(i apologize for the terrible comparison.) it should be appreciated only surprisingly good acting (which crazy because an eighties also a horror well.) originality most vampire are dime dozen *cough* john carpenter's vampires forsaken (sorry honey :*)*cough* lost boys breathed new life into floundering genre doesn't drag on long with hated 'tenseful' violent death scenes vamps die we move healthy would remiss if did mention lovely soundrack concert scene indian looking man has to entertaining moments in entire although at times songs annoying they fun offer flash nostalga rememberance okay goofy sometimes best approach have kinda bad thing say about film what ugly kid starr always around apparently boy lordy you could fooled me classic
like an old fashioned horror
man i love this movie!! !
good , great best !
a cool vampire movie , very entertaining . it has few funny parts in not real scary but good
i was very suprised at how well this movie did scare me . even to day , it is creepy scary loved and try watch every halloween good  !
right up there as a classic .
i love this movie!! !
a classic not scary but just it was funny
i rate it tops for originality and starting a genre ; although as usual , you can run good thing into the ground !
this one spawned a whole lot of imitations . freddy kreuger was the ultimate villain as he could enter his victims nightmares with deadly consequences.at time-this film boldly original and quite well acted,with what were then state art special effects,to boot
the first nightmare will always be best . story behind (told later in new nightmare) holds true to this day if you don't keep monster alive by telling and retelling his , monsters found among us is something believed many i can personally say that freddy scared bejesus out of me time saw it now it's more like comedy but original had some serious horror freddy's one liners became a joke after movie truly hid my eyes alot during not just because was only 16 years old at
this movie would have long been forgotten if it wasn't for bruce lee . his screen presence , power and stunning physique make worth watching..and williams massive fro there is no way roper could beat bolo ! things to wtach out : 1 hans terribly dubbed voice 2 impressive 3 the "art of fighting without fighting" scene 4 "bull*** mr han-man!" 5 jackie chan getting neck snapped by master in underground lair 6 "the battle with guards was extra-ordinary!" 7 delivering a kick han's head
this is the best horror flick of all times.the concecpt music chills and thrills.-they rock ur soul stirr mind.kudos .
great movie .
i own the boxset , definitive one with 8 disks . have loved films as a child and do to this day original is stand-out but three new nightmare come in close second rest place my heart well also love robert englund (freddy)
wonderful , who says villains can't have a scense of humor . he is evil and funny at the same time if i was going to be killed would want freddy do it
changed the entire slasher genre , making villain have more character . this is one that made wes craven a household name required watching
my favorite film in the series , it went abit downhill afterwards .
you have to admit this is one of the scariest films all time . robert englund did a great job as freddy krueger and i was glad see johnny depp in movie too heather lagenkamp good actress i'm sad she's not film business anymore
this was an excellent movie . a you can watch more then once
all of you listen : a nightmare on elm street is the best horror movie in history . i never saw an like that.not even now with tech things that producers have. was made first 87..then got along 90s remember watching movies,was kid. had about 8,9years when watched movies from him..with my older brother and parents. dreamed it. every time sick,with fever..everynight..i same dream..i hospital..and freddy would come for me..grabbing me leg..and takin away..everynight..i think ive trauma that. so dont say krueger s*** cuz it aint just registered to write
freddy kruger rocks! ! and this movie it's very intresting! scary too all the perfect ingredients to make a horror movie!
the scarriest movie that i've ever seen! ! i had nightmares for days first time saw movie!! still can't really watch whole in one sitting!
the first nightmare takes cake ! kid being drug across ceiling was fabuloso also girl in body bag through hall of school during day this still scares living s@#t out me  , and i have seen a ton horror films my 38 yr.s is best to date...just don't go sleep
definately a classic horror movie  ! i remember falling totally in love with johnny depp after seeing him this flick . 1,2 , freddy's coming for you.....3,4 better lock the door......5,6 get crucifix....7,8 stay up late.....9,10...never sleep again
truly innovative for 1984 . i am a freddy freak!i collect all kinds of horro movie stuff and is my fav the still sends bit scare into me on nights when by myself.i recently saw vs jason loved it ! hubby fan hard-core made things interesting at home
still the actor and movie to compare all martial arts actors movies .
i saw it when was 12 and couldn't sleep for a week . good movie
i love this movie very scary freddie gives the creeps but he also makes me laugh ive seen lts of times
very good . scary a original idea
nightmare on elm street was one of the first horror films to add depth theme by adding a phycological factor . it wasn't just face hidden behind mask out slaughter everyone....freddy could only enter in your dreams , and those who were children made us think more (and sleep less!) also had catchy tune (one two freddy's coming for you..) that other don't have my favorite series are parts three part because it's original unique ways freddy tortured his victims wes craven is brilliant !
freddy is the only movie slasher whose wit as sharp his knife glove,ya gotta love it .
i had nighmares for a year after this one !
certainly the best of them all , although i really liked a new nightmare . have never forgot freddy and think he is one horror heroes ! no parties like still remember tv series they put out great film love part where nancy sees dead girl in body bag outside class room door
the first nightmare on elm st . is one of scariest movies i've ever seen freddy great because he scares hell out me and makes laugh at same time all have their scary moments where alison's brother got tore up by in school restroom made afraid to go public restrooms for along
this was the best out of all rest . movie actually scared me very good and even plot after i watched it , gave nightmares first last to do that
i give all of the nightmare on elm street movies high ratings because these really scare me and they make not want to sleep . you stay up think it's true even though know director is good
this is one of the best horror movies ever made . only that i still can't watch without keeping lights on series kept scary sense throughout whole movie
some tea mr.braitherwaight ? one of many good quotes from martial arts master bruce lee's finest movie . somewhat old but has improved like a fine wine with time
this is the greatest horror movie ever made . it was real enough to keep people interested and not too corny for time in great
this is an all time childhood thriller that gauranteed to keep kids up at night . one , two freddys coming for you three four better lock the door......and get scared out of your sleep
it is a horror and has johnny depp in ! what more can you ask for film i mean hes just the king of films . he aint hunk but great at acting too christina ricci alright (bitch!) abd love depp's glasses/goggle things
headless guy runs around killing people and creating madness mayhem in local town.. . great family movie
this is such a crazy movie it scared the freak out of me very cool !!! !
beautiful ! this film's a classic the script's really amazing and wow.. . i've been big fan of film its my #1 fav for about year by now (almost)
bruce lee drops a lot of knowledge . the fighting choreography is excellent plot and acting great one my favorite movies man
i espesially liked the part where headless horseman cut that guy in half under covered bridge
bruce lee's last movie is nice and more intense . my favorite part when he killed o'hara for the self-sacrificing of his sister then , fought in a one on also room mirrors where finally found way to kill him with single fierce kick showing how quick nunchuks this cool
it is sumptuous . the beauty of film takes over when plot briefly drags i will add this to my collection , and treasure for classic that time prove
scariest movie of my life . the cat is evil as hell eh hah ha
i am a horror movie junkie and have seen them all from exorcist to ceremony this is one of the three scariest best stories for . im not sure you can make better
bruce lee is the best martial artist ever . i like all movies it's too bad he had to die at such a young age
scared the crap out of me .
as in most cases , the book was much better . although this is not one of king's works it well worth read and sequal just plain inane a side note to goneaway i bet doesn't take scare stuffing out you! !
behind the exorcist this is freakiest movie i have ever seen!! ! after cat dies and then kid , he plants them into indian ground they come back as not alive just evil.. . freaky!!
wow , i cant believe some people didnt think this was scary ! have to say that it is the only movie has ever scared me saw when younger and refused see again . can honestly let in comlete hysteria still nightmares about am scarred for life now severly terrified of leaving my computer thinking a true horror though
ooh the shoe left by kid when he got hit...gave me nightmares for weeks .
this is probably the scariest film i have ever seen . saw at theater when was twelve years old and still to very day can't lay eyes or ears on zelda ! (i had so many pre-pubescent nightmares about her , it's just not funny!!!) fyi : really played by a man  supposedly married woman who rachel weird huh ? has got be one of most depressing movies made as well drab colors innocent creatures like cats children are suddenly evil everyone dies in end!(no virginal teenage heroines carry us into sequel!) would definitely recommend anyone wants good gloomy fright doesn't mind seeing skeletal yellow monster guise
only stephen king can combine the ramones with a horror movie and do it well . is one of scariest i've seen , i still shudder at zelda hey if you can't sit through whole like have over 30 times then just watch ending scary,scary,bam!!,climax!!......ramones ! best to by far
it was the scariest movie i ever saw . had a totally original idea which still scares me to this day very good cast as well that old man really creepy
scary and realistic . good graphics a horror classic story was , creepy from beginning to end
best stephen king movie ever made . i loved this the story was awesome , and it actually scary would recommend to anybody
pet sematary was one of the scariest movies i have ever seen . afraid to drive home from my friend's house after watching it because thought would run over a cat ! very scary
this was also a great movie . it kind of bad acting but the thought behind good they went too far with pet sematary 2
bruce lee is a very successful and talented man . this movie showed his skills it was way for him to introduce the world new style of fighting
i love bruce lee . he's a great actor he does karate fights well
this is a classic . every scene well crafted drama working in both suspense and shock the acting excellent , most notably anguished gregory peck frantic david warner an eerie soundtrack too all cyliders were firing production of one rest series declines with each sequel but their failures shouldn't diminish appreciation
i love all the omen movies . really creepy if you read revelations damien's rise to power over course of films is one make hope this remains fiction !
this does a good job weaving the anti-christ theology into pop culture . device using photographs was unique , at least to me and clever scene in old etruscan cemetary scary gregory peck lee remick almost always did well with their material it is worth look
i'm not religous so i really did understand the whole dagger thing mean what if you cut kids head off would't he die enjoyed movie very much but why daggers isn't that fiction wouldn't know
this is a classic bruce lee flick . savage as ever and pulls off some awesome stunts once you get past the dubbing in english , movie will thrill
a bit more scarier than the exorcist . most creepiest part of film , ending
one of the all time greats .
one of the best horror series all time . excellent acting , thrills chills not to mention awesome storyline/plot
one of the best movies bruce lee made and it was his last . great action in this movie awesome
what can i say ? like horror movies . especially with religious trappings it comes from being raised in a christian family , and years of going to summercamp where as adolescents we would lay out under country sky full stars (if you've ever seen the night true dark you'll understand this.)and speculate about darker aspects mythos : hell demonic possession (see exorcist [1973]) course most popular spooky all...the rise antichrist end world ! this one was good for hours scaring each other stupid-- if happens tonight -- you are unfamiliar subject matter all probably makes little or no sense but at familiar wide protestantism almost certainly know exactly i'm talking not bear me omen (1976) taking it's book revelations bible rode crest wave religio-horror films made seventies there many reasons why these were so number which i've already discussed my review basically touched people much more personal way than that came before dracula frankenstein thing...they pretend real horrors right bible...that different altogether short blurred line between impossible only possible absolutely is reason broke typical movie demographic--older went see tham well younger ones another simply they tended feature mature established performers who older audiences directed by richard donner ( superman )from script originally titled  story turned down every studio pitched because too scary put on film find hard believe even mid-seventies standards surely equate lots publicity $$$$$ simplest hollywood mind said such things black masses horned demons became interested had toned-down ultimately warner brothers stylishly intelligent resulted centers around ambassador robert thorne his wife (gregory peck lee remick) after their son dies birth adopt child damien born same time hospital long until unpleasant start happening always center them film's scenes death mayhem classic--a nanny (holly palance) hangs herself view guests damien's fifth birthday party making fiercely protective governess mrs baylock (billie whitelaw) priest(patrick troughton)who witnessed impaled falling lightning rod fall (or pushed) windows wild dogs attack an unforgettable moment involving sheet plate glass flies back truck followed closely freelance photographer jennings (david warner) has begun notice something strange frightening photographs he taken victims ocurrences together set really presented sincere straightforward manner draws viewer wills him her least hour fifty minutes acting throughout violence though extreme often bizarre nature rather unsensationalized (it mark donner's skill able do this.)that gives improbable grainy realism two decent sequels ii (1978) iii (1980) starring sam neill jurassic park ) adult mention mildly amusing (to stretch point)tv called iv awakening (1992) just remember (as original north american newspaper ads first pointed out) today think might be...the
love all the omen movies . i want some more !
wonderful ! one of the holy satan trilogy . exorcist,rosemary's baby and then...the omen if this movie isn't creepy i don't know what is just seeing good people die horrible deathsa scary in itself but idea god foresaking us leaving to by hands damien , anti-christ frightning part true horror fans should all have on list film darling hold it close my heart will name first born marry a girl named rosemary house keeper reagan make split pea soup for lunch lame joke sorry
this movie is one of the scariest movies all times . i like how picture old looks from back in days story tight and hella freaky
this movie was very scary because it messes with people's faith and what you believe in , when people the it's shows how strong your is .
i thought bruce lee was the bomb . loved way killed that dude at end love asian power
this is one of the best movies i ever watched . religion are scariest and was scary
that movie is hilarious....scary and hilarious ! i laughed my ass off during movie....thats a 5!!!!!.....nice death scene drew... .
scream was great cuz it fun trying to figure out who the killer . entertaining
the greatest bruce lee movie of all . a lot excellent fight scenes has very good plot this action set standard for martial arts movies future best time
i got scared witless ! kept thinking was going to get killed by some masked looney after watching it nearly threw up when watched the first time because eating chips and ketchup
quite thrilling and suspenseful . this is not really a film to watch more than few times , largely because knowing how it ends kills the fun of watching movie well-written acting solid although could have been better catches audience's attention from very beginning effectively keeps until screen flades black thriller that regenerated ailing horror genre after long series losers
scared the crap right out of me when i saw it summer 97.totally ingenious ! a movie filled with cheers and jeers other horror movies . was impressed
the best of them all .
it's definetly a true cult b-movie classic . the beginning scared hell out of me and drew barrymore was so convincing in her role then course , we see getting gutted to death you feel bad forget just movie it really makes connect with charatcers know
this movie was a classic bruce lee flick . the best kung fu around plus bolo fighting sequences are well worth just watching in action is most excellent
i'm not a big fan of this sub-genre created by hitchcock (this is , in no way an attack on mind you) but along with it's sequel halloween i can make exception . wes craven has definately something entertaining and at the same time very good yet he wasn't done came out that was alot better !
love it !
the movie wsa really cool . there was a lot of blood shed
this movie kicks ass . bruce lee is tight an action classic the plot good acting a little bad , but fighting makes up for that
classic ! way better thanthe others i love what they do
this is probally my favortie scary movie of all times i like the first one a lot better than 2nd or 3rd
noone can tell me they didn't enjoy this movie...it was great !
i think all of the screams were fantastic!!! ! i've seen 3 and once turn it on , just can't off!! highly recommend 4 teenagers 15 over!! watch it!!!!
come on , this is one of the most clever horror movies ever made . you really don't know how it's going to end and entertaining best yet cheesy scary
this movie was awesome . an excellent line up after nightmare on elm street a great mystery for the young generation
i really enjoyed this movie . it was suspenseful , scary and funny the best of scream movies
this is the best movie that bruce lee ever made . all fight scenes are realistic there was no one will take his place
the beginning of movie was best , non-stop killing(yeah woohoo) ! i sitting on pins and needles surprised at end . mean kind thought it you-know-who but didn't know
i will someday be known as the 1st film with that actor who played stu (the bland guy is one of killers) . great action- he's in a branagh now
this movie revolutionized the level at which a scary can be defined as successful . it made over $150 million box office and scored great reviews i really enjoyed because kept me guessing
the best horror movie i've ever seen . it mixed wit and with an interesting plot neve campbell is too hot !
this movie has set the standards for horror movies in nineties . way that uses comedy along with is a great blend of magic also , keeping audience guessing until end now classic mainstay today's
i thought that it was a good breakout movie for bruce lee . think however the storyline followed very much like james bond martial arts were great , and more movies should show
i think scream is one of the most creative horror movies ever created . they make it feel like you know what's happening , then all a sudden give big twist at end and leaves really stunned
i think this was one of the scariest movies ever saw . thought it hella good kept me jumping and screaming
this movie has it all- intriguing plot , hot guys and lots of blood guts . keeps you guessing throughout the entire whodunit most annoying characters get killed
scream was a scary and funny movie the opening puts you in mood for rest of
one of the best movies i have seen . bruce lee is my martial arts idols storyline was good , as well action also liked fact they didn't dub over his real voice
the first movie in a long time that was genuinely scary , but also made fun of genre it is . loved surprises and humor
i thought scream was a great movie because it different from all the other previous horror movies . very fun and kept me on edge of my seat
this movie is great ! scary and funny . laughs at itself other horror movies the main character , sydney smart her boyfriend not only doesn't save he's one of two killers characters were believable i find myself rooting for them being amazed death methods- decapitated by a garage door- whoah
wes craven's scream brought about a much needed horror movie revolution . it was definitely not the typical slasher flick characters were unique , especially buff guy his comments poked fun at movies combination of gore sly remarks and popular actors actresses made this success
bruce lee is a real good fighter in this movie . i enjoy all the fighting scenes and his clever tricks have watched it many times wouldn't mind watching again
it's a great movie . very scary and unpredictable keeps you on the edge of your seat acting was good enough to make it an awesome drew barrymore gave performance
scream is an outstanding horror movie with a surprise ending . personally , i feel the best out of its trilogy has scary moments that jump at you unexpectedly
not only was scream a thriller , but it also very funny . the movie made toward college students
this is the definitive kung fu flick with only star , bruce lee . was already destined to be a classic when it made movie set standard for following films
i loved this movie because it was unique . the storyline original and ending unexpected in addition , acting also terrific one ranks up there with know what you did last summer
scream was one of the best movies that i've seen in a while .
that movie was full of surprises!!! !
the best !
i like all of bruce lee's movies . it'a a good biography his life and career would recommend watching this
this movie has always creeped me out . heather o'rourke was perfect as carol anne may she rest in peace
scared the crap out of me as a kid and only gets better now that i'm an adult.i loved carolanne !
i am rating this from a 12 yr olds state of mind since that is when saw it for the first time . at , lived in evergreen colorado huge log cabin surrounded by tons trees just so happened had tree outside my bedroom window wouldn't sleep there wks
fantastic!! ! wonderful story and terrific acting
another scary film personally i've found haunted house movies to be scariest if their done well and this ones the best in tradition of amityville horror burnt offerings two previous good but dated flims . is though i mean even little girl was for some reason couldn't watch movie my teen years didn't view until into 20's still don't care much sleeping bedrooms/living rooms at night with t.v sets nuff said
bruce lee is the man . his action sequences in movie are amazing
this movie still never ceases to scare me . i hate watch it alone
this is one of my favorite movies that suspenseful . with the cute little carol ann who can hear t.v people and gets taken away by i found it intersting how poltergeist came around their house why all weird stuff was happening
oooh , this is another creepy film that we children of the 80's grew up with ! something about little girl and tv set still makes hair on back my neck stand to day .
this is one of the only two movies that have ever really frightened me . i saw in second grade it genuenly took my nerves to breaking point finally got up nerve see again sixth and realized better haunted house stories put film written produced by steven speilberg directed master macabre tobe hooper genius behind texas chainsaw massacre not just about fright but family as well heart warming funny scary highky recommend
i had nightmares for several nights . was the same age as girl in movie when first saw it
bruce lee is the man . his action sequences in movie are amazing
this is a very old scary movie . i used to hide in my bed because the was stuck head
great movie , it may not seem scary but i watche dit at like three am and jumped once or twice . how cool was when he dismembered his girlfriend ? that awesome ! what's up with the guy who's rating says "not my kind of movie." you should be dissqualified people want to now this stacks what your favorite color is if prefer vanilla over chocolate prick
enter the dragon is best bruce lee flick ever made .
this movie was enormously gross and entertaining . it is also one of the few examples a good original film an improved sequel all 3 evil dead flicks (including army darkness) are well worth modest rental investment at local video shop
i still remember seeing this movie for the first time was not even old enough to see r rated movies but got in and am so glad did
bad horror rules !
it is quite frightening the first watch or two , and then from there on either just pure entertainment ultimate coolness !
tied for my all time favorite horror movie along with the original dawn of dead
enter the dragon is best fighting movie of all time , immortalizing great bruce lee .
this movie is great ! it has special effects , for its time . absolutely a classic awesome really scary i couldn't sleep that night love all the gore
now this is funny . when i 1st saw it was laughin a whole lot the series has always managed to make me laugh showed movie an old friend of mine and don't see why but really bothered her ring didn't bother wonder what they were thinkin had tree branch rape scene another classic moment we will all remember
dude , this movie was hilarious!! ! i loved it . the laughing demon is great do a wonderful imitation definately one of better low budget films have ever seen even if ashley sissy girl who screams alot
this is the film to watch in a dark movie house , it scared hell out of me...if does'nt scare you nothing will !
greatest movie ever made . the amount of gore literally knocked me off my seat when i first watched it then proceded to watch again rated nc-17 for extreme violence and barely any movies get that rating
scary as hell ! i love bruce cambell the first ed was scary,ed2 scary-funny , and aod a riot!i suggest everybody see this movie if you like deadites
what an amazing film ! definatly in the top five movies of all time my book . mel gibson did job acting and directing has epic battle seguences overwhelmingly inspiring a story orphan boy that was raised byb his uncle when horrible king longshanks comes into power he is forced to fight for something never had freedom will hate drive him towards inspiror men masterpiece full felt emotion ( rated r strong graphic violence , language ; 2 f-bombs sexual content including nudity.)
a classic movie w/ real action sequences that is totally irreplacable by any of the modern blockbusters .
i really like this movie . i'd watch it a thousand times...the evil dead didn't go with the cute jokes and conventional thought for most horror movies had one thing on its agenda : people to die , they did special effects while so obviously are just gross-looking enough make you want gag anyway (and very few things me anymore considering number of i've seen) start was great think trees would actually possess her...i they'd raped her that unneccessary too...) scene ashley attempting dismember his girlfriend pretty cool sam raimi job hm i'm little put-off by who felt leave giant paragraphs practically nothing more than them referring themselves in third person makes sound deluded egomaniacs
if you dont like any of the evil dead movies have a poor sense humor .
i am a huge fan of bruce cambell ! even bought the army darkness figurine . these movies are fantastic....if you love horror with comedic twist for also if your into b-movies great sitting back friends and having lots laughs
now keep in mind that the glory isn't a huge horror movie fan . kind of by association but during 1 year period had her fair share scary-type movies didn't think this one scary or gross perhaps is becoming desensitized it doesn't matter , still enjoyed first evil dead trilogy very much did 'ashley' was kinda wimp where he pretty cool cat with best catch lines ever rest series also thought tree rape scene unnecessary..but damn set standard for following sam raimi darkness present beneath surface..or woods watched long time after she 2 and army neat to see way whole thing started fact would suggest seeing order highly suggests as part any fun night friends
one of the most original horror movies ever made . evil dead was sam raimi's first big movie and served him very well a group friends rent nasty old cabin for weekend but over night it turns into blood bath after demon resurection passages from necronomicon are resighted its deadites unleashed out trilogy , this is best don't excpect cute jokes bruce campbell's witty liners really actually effective in grotesquness shock value when i saw had no idea going to be as gory sick ! great beggining not many trilogys keep their mojo up entire series does an incredible job highly recommended you your mates
the part where branch went you know was disgusting! ! this movie seriously almost made me vomit! it rocked!
evil dead scared me the whole time with it's twisted plots and gross special effects .
this is probably one of the most legendary low budget movies . as opposed to blair witch project , in case film not only actors are hysterical but also viewers get their share madness special effects and filming techniques that were used a sometimes quite experimental manner an absolute novelty at time add involvement audiences into extremely scary bloody movie
terrific movie . well shot and acted creepy ending
this movie was one of the freakiest but most interesting movies i ever saw . love ending too
this movie is simply amazing ! a very exciting plot with shocking twist at the end . nicole kidman gives wonderful , brilliant performance as do two children and everyone else in candlelight setting music add to suspense i highly reccomend thrilling just want watch it again
this film was one of the best in past few years especially genre . while it's difficult to label it 'horror' , certainly doesn't lack suspense based on a popular foreign fim has fantastic storyline carried by strong cast kidman shines as neurotic anxious mother and children are surprisingly talented i actually wasn't bored at all thought director did wonderfully creating dark melancholy aura plot twists subtle jumps causes fine acting make not miss
wow . what a great film it's nice to see something like this come along , especially right when you're ready give up on genre kidman is amazing in all of the performances were top-notch and story was well crafted keeps you guessing until that mind blowing plot twist i'm still marveling over
a really great film that had me going , right up to the surprise ending . sent chills down my mind without any use of knives axes or other devices...and not drop blood spilt
i think this was the first movie saw of nicole and she played part very well loved stunned at end .
great acting , unpredictable outstanding plot a knockout ending . this is must see movie
wowee!this is a fantastic ghost story that recalls turn of the screw and other traditional horror films.very well made acted .
i am not a big fan of nicole kidman , but this was very good movie . the end really shocked me it well worth seeing!! !
great acting , thriller !
very good acting by nicole and the storyline was superb . keeps you riveted until end
this movie exceeded my expectations . it keeps you thinking and trying to solve the mystery until end what ending ! really exeptional in every aspect ; acting , story (in both originality character development) location
this movie had the one of most original and mysterious twists i've ever seen . from beginning to end , i loved my absolute favorite part - at very boy is leaving with his family he looks back other standing in window then they disappear great way !
a great , spooky movie with some superb acting from nicole kidman and the rest of cast .
just when you think the psychological horror film has been completely replaced by slash , gash and trash films along comes a gem like this ! others devilishly played with my mind scared me silly at several points all without exploiting one drop of blood . tale reached deep into human psyche pulled out many things we fear dread imagine i don t realized that nichole kidman could even act until saw her in part but she does great job as nervous high-strung mother two strangely afflicted children matter fact entire cast is excellent house grounds also provide wonderful gothic setting rivaling anything from golden age hollywood (think rebecca  wuthering heights jane eyre ) had very thick atmospheric feeling beautifully shot what appears to be mostly natural light rental for dark stormy night
go harrison ford! !
more like hysterically funny.. .
it would great to have a mogwai for pet , providing you don't get them wet and feed after midnight .
this is one of those movies that comes along once in a while and hits the nail on head creates genre . sometimes low budget flick with no-name cast does it--this it not as violent advertised have some sterotypes , i.e crazed southern inbred backwoods family but put your skepticism aside revel horror suspense effort
classic . made on a very small budget , just like 90% of the horror films again i have to say story development charector and things that make you go hmmmm are not boring need pay attention this movie is never dull hate stupid people......
wow its a classic
classic . would rather watch this one then the remake
a classic war movie , one of the best as far ww2 flicks go . i really like marvin major reismen this story is feached by it i'm concerned kudose to jaywilton forgot about jim brown in think jefferson was his name
this movie rocks! ! the only flaw is it takes a while for to get intresting , but that really doesn't ruin me! was scary! i mean dark scenery creepy and grandpa creepiest element of flim probably one my favorite flims all time leatherface scary very entertaining also like whole hillbilly family thought they were hilarious scary!!if you haven't seen highly recommend view . it's
steven spielberg hired tobe hooper to direct poltergeist because of this film . nuff said influential , disturbing and brilliantly directed (and edited) you can skip the needless recent remake sequels a bizarre with renee zellweger matthew mc (i won't even try spell his last name)
best movie ever ! need i say more ?
this movie is very loosely based on the true story of ed gein . he actually did wear clothes made from human flesh , as well eat meat but that were real life and seperate still tcsm one my all time classics
i seen this for the first time last night . don't get me wrong , movie is really bad its flat out horrible so truly terrible that it made a good comedy rather than horror film watching half dead woman run all over place in middle of away from mad man leather face with chainsaw blazing through air one most best pieces ive reccomended and distrubing material haven't any sequels but hope to see them coming friday
the right cast for story;the lack of f words isn't missed . and jim brown's last run looks like a more effective weapon than any tank
i think the scariest part of movie is knowing that this based on a true story . was freaked out since first sceen begain had no idea what in for awsome , and am excited to see remake when it comes will be cool seeing them try do same thing as original
this is on of the top 5 greatest horror movies all time !
classic movie , not as scary i thought it would be but does have class and that is what stands apart from all the other modern horror movies except halloween night of living dead . this shows a family insane killers going about their everyday tasks gets to people phrases like told you stay away graveyard  never could take no pleasure in killing cook or let's let grandpa whack always said he was best me leatherface do work he's just hitchhiker these many them put into context they are make film disturbing some others will duplicated topped because once achieve perfection certain area there way improve whatever case texas chainsaw massacre masterpiece don't get for those enjoy
seeing the texas chain saw massacre , twenty-five years later is like ripping open sarcophagus from which come all modern horror movies . and now available once again in an excellent dvd edition still scares shat out of even today's jaded audiences eschews plot character development terms as much a pure sensory experience can be put on film after reports graverobbing necrophilic mutilation group young people head to see if any their departed grandparents were among ones desecrated along way they pick up deranged hitchhiker -- he doesn't last long with them slicing himself razor laughing wind being forced stop for gas then make mistake wandering over nearby house.. say further than that course would sacrilege it yourself though story has been ripped off by so many other run through seems cliche but amazingly when you original first time just vanishes blows everything else remotely far screen it's astonishing imitators get words not music surprisingly gory movie gore frightening this where most trip : they're really scare anyone rather mortify what's genuinely about setup payoff atmosphere primal dread goings-on sense whatever we are there worse things lingering offscreen night living dead halloween two horrific films shot flat spare almost documentary-style fashion at same breathtaking look shots house steeped orange sunset or roomful bones have raw beauty no able imitate nickle-and-dime budget achieved what costing hundred times can't close flaw ends abruptly needed third act another round happenings came before seem more complete does achieve today part aren't too sly knowing real elemental veins something serves reminder scream friday 13th wish that's one shapes opinion.....the shape
this is one of the best movies ever ! kudos to you leatherface your real american badass .
one of the true horror classics ! leatherface is so awesome! imagine getting chased by him in dark because he's hungry ? i have never forgotten this movie and it will always be a classic to me .
in the mood for something truly disturbing tonight ? then you should check out texas chainsaw massacre . tobe hooper's horror masterpeice , is one of most influential movies ever made this story 5 youth and there afternoon drive turning into a gory hellish night terror murder movie that brought us leatherface played by gunner hansen intersting well. bad-ass characters imagined so come with his red-neck cannibalistic family down to thier house dinner main course ! maybe can play let-grampa-beat-you-in-the-head hammer other fun party games i only wish was around when theatres oringinal definition raw milestone history must see any true fans
now this boys and girls.. . is horror done right not only one of the coolest ideas ever (beat blair witch to whole fake true story deal by over a decade) it also presents us with more realistic monster...the red neck you watch film tell me wouldn't be scared poo less if your friends were all being served while are bound at dinner table in nasty house that has smell like sh*t approached taunted group back woods hillbilly cannibals would scare chased through unfamiliar forrests maniac weilding chainsaw wearing mask made human skin ? there no suspense just pure shock terror see eyes victims as well psychos tobe hooper did great job picture can almost taste putrid air leatherface clan's feel hammer comeing down on top head for meat eating what psycho shower taking classic shoker highly recommend hell treat
lee marvin at his very best!! !
this movie was so far from the run of mill . their grandpa creepy i love movie!! !
it's a cheapie , cheesy but something about this movie makes ones skin crawl.tons of atmosphere....i don't know....but is truly creepy .
this movie is a classic !
i thought braveheart was by far one of the best movies i've seen and is in my opinon films decade.the cinematogrophy it's weak pionts ; but acting ecellent.mel gibson did a great job , though would not recommend it to who has trouble watching war like do graphic content . otherwise amazing story truly inspirational
i love movies about vampires and dracula is a great classic bela lugosi just the perfect person to play he's wonderful actor! ! this movie never will get tired of watching it good ole black-and-white! has memorable eerie feeling when attacks!! that's what makes movie!! it's an absolute masterpiece be forever!
the dirty dozen was an awesome movie . it about twelve soldiers who were given another chance they taken out of prison and offered freedom if volunteered for a dangerous mission acting , storyline humor made very good
wonderful retelling of the dracula legend . with exception keanu reeves , acting was exceptional if only they had got someone else to play harker oh well you can't have it all anyway production values are and sets unreal
one of my favorites . although i think keanu sux in just about everything he does and also the same wynona ryder , movie had such a great script gary oldman is an incredible actor that it was worth seeing at theatre copola did excellent job direction (look what to struggle w/ though)
a war movie . twelve excons form group called the dirty dozen to execute suicide mission in heart of nazi germany during world ii humorous and witty dialogue become human beings again one greatest movies all time with great acting , plot
this movie is very close to the book as far plot and story . special effects were great suspense was appealing
what an excellent movie ! i don't think would classify it as horror , but the costumes acting and music were fantastic . even have t-shirt highly recommend this for any vampire afficianado
i used to love these movies . would watch them by myself and then be scared the rest of night jumping at every little sound
good !
okay , they can be cheesey . but jason deserves more respect
the best horror series to date .
the best in series this was scary
im a big fan of jason , he's da man! ! i love the thrill and course chi ha in movies . have his mask on my bedroom wall dissguised as for halloween since was like 13 years old.the first 3 sucked but rest we're kool.i all will him forever rules!!!
2 great jobs by actors ! a must see for everyone........ .
what a good horror movie . this along with the much better and scarier halloween , started teen revolution is by far one of best classic 80's slash films decade shot well at an actual summer camp consisting lightly talented cast(kevin bacon being only to go anywhere.he also has startling scene in speedo )and original idea for time kind switch on psycho rather than motel gruesome effects master tom savini give extra boost you cannot deny how cool that girl looks axe freshly buried into her youthful face or realism early throat slitting if counsler who never makes it deaths,led funny entertaining franchise led jason(who second michaelmyers halloween.)and helped kevin start career!recommended see before counsling camping hehe callmetootie even seen ? there like boob whole ! from spending alot female nudity but tootie got gorefest part right brains guts i must have missed several trillion times i've still love ya hooray
the greatest horror saga of all time .
all of the movie sequences freddy are very well put together . plot continues from one to next
i have no idea how people are not scared by this one . am easily rattled but movie creeped me out ! whew what a good
judging by some of the comments below , people didn't get it. . (way big spoilers) wrote something about only having to make a copy tape and you lived not case at all in fact no would be necessary point was that mom (watts) son won't die as long there are others who have since seen their week hasn't passed so for example i see (my 7 days starts) but then show it someone else my stops (pauses?) until new victim dies it's like chain letter - or rather ring.. problem is keep showing order me continue living (that's kind where movie ends which made very creepy me) making copies help this suppose could just original copying process has nothing do with curse hope helps appreciate film little more..
whoa that was a weird movie.. .
the best scary movie ever !
you are an idiot if gave this movie less then 5. . but i guess need a bit of brains to understand one. freak out
i had nightmares yaaaaaaaaay !
i really like this movie , even though it was not that scary . the way they would show things from happening to people cool
the frist time i saw this movie was in theatres with two girls...i scared outta my mind ! but now laugh soo hard when ever watch it love horror movies and great...oh again its pretty funny to make fun of...
one of the best horror movies i have seen in a very long time . it several times (on cable) & never ceases to frighten love
one of my favorite recent horror movies .
i loved daveigh chase as samara morgan . will go far in the cinema you have to see japanese film , read novel and comic book understand this movie better though
the scariest movie i've seen in a long time .
7 days!! !
one of the scarriest movies all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! suspense & scarry moments are countless!!!!!! it makes you think!!!!!
this is one of my favorite movies . it was funny seeing everyone freak out in the theater over some dumbest things well did get me part i screamed holy shite and hurt friends ear
it was fantastic i enjoyed a lot
i thought the ring was a really good movie and also thouught it scary fact that they sorta left you hanging is even scarier ! but little boy he didn't blink once in ws freaky had some big eyes!!!! ha
that movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen !
her slayed corpse rests still// ghost within the tape// watches watcher
excellent movie . this one definitely makes my a list the scenery is beautifully dressed story of william wallace legendary in its telling , and battle scenes are magnificent if you have not had chance to rent do so will be disappointed i recommend dvd set wide screen mode
this scared the crap out of me i was shaking for 2 days
the beginning of movie looks like another scary-teen , but it's not ! very nice act and plot .
i've just seen the original japanese version (ringu , 1998 - http://us.imdb.com/title?0178868) . movie was very quiet(!) but scary like hell look forward to see american copy (some reporters say this is even a better film) !
wow , what can i say ! john woo is truly made for directing action movies especially shoot-em-up flicks . with the addition of nicholas cage and travolta i'm simply speechless story was fresh a change acting way up there poetic shootouts were jaw-dropping but think best film has to be hard boiled movie i've witnessed first hand it makes face/off look like kid's anything by will do
i loved this movie and saw it twice at the theater . think teens are more into because they get scared easier thought was so creative with not too much gore , kind of sent chills down your back..the way scary movies should be !
that movie is like so funky. . even tho it wasnt scary i still liked it!! ! rock on!!'
omg , it was scarey ! for teens like me who saw we almost pissed ourselves . after my cousin he unplugged his tv when got home and best friend accidentally stepped on the remote turned though she didn't know did screamed soo loud i thrive thrill
one of the best , well put together horror movies that past 20 years . great graphics make up and acting this film a must see
my favorite modern day horror movie - arguably the best non-american made movie.. .
i aboustly love this film it is one of the finest films ive seen in while fliming and direction wonderfully done should really been any horror fan enjoy epicaly with whats out there now a days find differnt origanl many levels be .
i give this film five stars , not basing it on the entire world horror films but of today . it's hard for a fan to find good flick nowaday concept survival is portrayed very well and originality zombies' behavior as compared george romero's was incredible finally new take old material
at last , a film that the british movie indusrty can be proud of . we certainly wasn't expecting it to popular in america has fantastic plotline amazing music and some scenes take your breath away was very strange seeing london without any people or traffic there especially since i live action is kept up well fact entire shot digital makes noticable difference when raining dvd good as you see alternative endings documentaries bloody
i was reading an ad in the paper and it said that you will be looking for exit at 5 min mark thats exactly what did . movie very well made,shot,and acted.the disturbing factor of this through roof.many unexpected events happenings to keep on edge all times.if want see somthing push boundaries making go
great movie . not a gorefest , but it has its moments eerie almost surreal
a gory , creepy thriller from the director of trainspotting . remarkable acting and frantic cinematography make up for what may lack in terms plot ultimately this is fierce critique nature humanity masked blood trauma if you're looking more than mindless action flick you won't regret seeing film but don't see it alone..
i love silly movies
one of my favorite werewolf films .
an excellent movie about american who takes a trip to england and gets turned into werewolf , the action never really seemed stop . one of few movies out there that is actually all actors did job i would even almost go as far saying were some oscar worthy performances going on...excellent  ! must see if you haven't already
a classic for any horror buff . the effects were nice  , story line is also actors pretty good too 2 boys take trip to england they are on outskirts of town in middle nowhere see pub and go inside asked what star wall was people at went ape $hit after that sent them out one david gets attacked by warewolf turns into next full moon other boy jack killed then see's later he undead until severed watch it movie
what a great horror film ! my favorite kind of is the that isn't afraid to have laugh . this one has many laughs in return , magnify two friends from america are attacked by werewolf and you like these guys david jack seem nice funny i wouldn't mind hanging out with anyway don't want either them get hurt not give away too much plot both men's lives change drastically after encounter things will never be same again comedy blend make very enjoyable unique experience for those who might judge movie before seeing based on horrid sequel an american paris rest assured completly different more fairy tale while london realistic (as far as fictional films go) take whole situation relise real special effects were actually there added later couple computer amrican classic highly under rated such sharply written original or since seen good look garuntee zero disapointment it easy me garuntee,see because money back anyways know where live soooo you're going deal if no sense humor really must say recommend motion picture
admittedly , it has its funny parts but i think that doesn't make a worse film . on the contrary comic scenes effect of horror ones even stronger in scotland are pretty scary and now more than 10 years after first watched can't walk down stairs to tottenham court road tube station london (where they shot part believe) without involuntarily looking behind me feeling kind tense very good
the movie speaks for itself . realistic and scary most people i know have not seen it in my opinion , effects back then on this were good think plot as a whole was five all way baby!! !
this show was funny , scary and had great music . i don't know how naughton downe have not acted much since made
i was a teenage werewolf,.. .
this was an extremely freaky movie . realistic ? no but it deffinately made one think
i thought this was a good movie it use scare me when first seen like 7 . but still its just not as the book
not scary in the least bit...i mean , really . insane clowns going around killing and chasing people with blood balloons is funny !
creepy . tim curry as pennywise the clown is one of most scariest clowns in a film
i really thought that face/off was a great action film and thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish . all the scenes- they kept me on edge of my seat , espescially ending scene also acting as is be expected by such fine actors john travolta nicholas cage think did job transforming into villian in this movie's attempt at integrating drama well short sure plot bit far-fetched but indeed unique had
hard to believe it's a true story.. .
very scary and creepy . you'll want to sleep with all the lights in house on...
very scary !
really good plot. . and the movies greatness was enhavced by travolta's attitude on screen.nicholas cage mognificent. even though story a little far fetched i thought it good. john woo did job in this film he got an amazing star cast
based on a true story , with the actors and events clearly best horror/scary movie of all time .
no , i don't believe it . well not anymore anyway this film still terrifies me the music and house just send shivers down my spine read novel which was better but is something of a classic-as far as haunted movies go what do you think please e-mail at turkeystuffing@hotmail.com if agree or disagree
i am getting scared just thinking about it !
damn this movie is scary i can't even watch it alone during the daytime . should definetely be at top of list but fact house only haunted that one particular family a little shady
i was totally frightened when saw this movie as a young boy . to day , its images haunt my memory of one haunted house in northern california obviously it presented manner that succeeded convey the story
this movie is very interesting because it supposedly based on a real life situation , even though i'm not sure about the spooks haunting house but was good keeping me edge of my couch . i gave film 5
love patrcia arquette she makes this movie sooo great!! !
great soundtrack !
what a great movie ! such brilliant and compelling plot .
this was hella' good . well put together i didn't know much about the subject , then wanted to more after saw movie
i saw this movie with a friend of mine and we both loved it . was kinda scary , but really the actor that played priest he is worth seeing
this was a very , good movie because it informative . the sparks between priest and stigmata girl were gross what he thinking ? i felt bad for she started to flip out in public people thought wanted kill herself ! ending too but didn't understand happened her until watched second time
the plot twists and turns to keep your attention . all of graphics were very fiting realistic movie itself was frighteningly real end left you feeling like , damn that could really happen
the cast was bomb ! i thought it cool and would watch again . love to play movie will
it's been a long time since good horror movie came out . if you are into scare stigmata is great one to rent it has effects and acting i was compare another , the that would fit best be exorcist
face off rules !
this movie was hella scary . i think it's because i'm very religious and get scared easily funny in a lot of movies , but (or like this) scares me the most
this was such an awesome movie . patricia arquette did in i loved it when she would speak the old gospel language just overall a great
this movie had me interested throughout the entire thing! ! and way it relates to realiy relly helped amplify its greatness becoming a classic
patricia arquette's presence helped me to overlook the occasional hole in story . great commentary on/against organized religion
i loved this movie , although it was controversial . am catholic and some of the issues really disturbed me but liked because raised about faith scenes were intense
i like action film and this had lots of it . also cage travolta seemed a little unrealistic but then again...who knows what can happen in the next few years
whenever i talk about stigmata always compare it to devils advocate by saying scared the devil out of me , literally but still haven't figured what . originally thought that was a movie posession found really corruption catholic church this had particular effect on because am have felt their doctrines are not in best interest people rather those power also very scary believed could only happen if your faith isn't strong and is happens when reaches ultimate level where you actually begin experience jesus went through his last moments after feel pretty much screwed either way go
two days ago i saw stigmata was overwhelmed ! in fact can't say witch one out of forrest gump is the best i've ever seen - cause their both perfect it puts as good gets third . just before went into cinema , read an huge norwegian news paper given movie six stars first about when came felt like a new spiritual person throughout whole freezed on my back had similar experienced with then didn't freeze cried for time life that can remember so intensely actually made me cry extremely powerful comes to pictures/colours/scripts sounds especially combination but unlike most movies horror/thrillers [!!] mission story look at world eyes five years old child discovering realities laws universe only critize vatican church also something tell atheists among us feel more agnostic less atheistic now than forget x-files stories people who claim they've met aliens ufos 'political correct use violence' fight club hits much harder how could this extraordinary get 6.1/10 from imdb.com users ? maybe because it's too controversial them they were afraid film's message what said : leave religion  they're religious brainwashness will be washed away by director even though haven't exorcist has nothing do reason original entertainment thought-provoking :-d
great movie , but i would file it under comedy ! ps : play the drinking game .
my alltime favorite movie . i jsut noticed sn is ash_williams too , not a coincidense respect people who sya this the worst evil dead (i dissagree but them) hate complain that it's bad cause it doesn't make sense that's because there"s two others dammit ! as for guy said he can't relate to ash no duh do you governator in predator ? if say you're jackass jack burton big trouble little china man doubt them nmovies now does
how can you go wrong with bruce campbell ?
i didn't think i'd like this movie going in , but actually really liked it . the special effects were great and actors acted well
this isnt exactly a horror movie , its more of comedy even though the first two evil deads were horrors .
more funny than scary , but still fun to watch . bruce campbell rules !
love it ! bruce campbell is once again funny and great . was a bit scary with the deadites , but not terrifing i still
this movie is better than chocolate !
the funniest of evil dead series . bruce cambell is like a comic book which gives this movie it's edge
i'm with mr . pink and thorne this movie is a great finisher for the trilogy ash becomes such badass in chapter those who find him shallow are dead wrong he's been through so much , cabin of evil creatures(twice) losing his hand girlfriend ! after all that he comes back kicks major ass to end series watch it
words cannot describe how much i love this movie . is provably my favorite b-movie ever bruce campbell hero sam raimi a genius ok people who watch and are expecting to be scared sorely dissapointed , because in no way scary hilarious for anyone with dark sense of humor you need see it the perfect blend horror comedy evil dead trilogy best history moviemaking army darkness end all great acting(you rule bruce!) one-liners catch phrases well an out movie.highly highly recomended!! !
one of the best action movies 90's , face/off actually has a well developed plot and characters . act is great so that it somewhat believable when john travolta nicholas cage are playing each others good scenes from woo
the absolute best trilogy ever . forget star wars , evil dead is a much deeper ok well not really it does make me laugh though these films have been focused on those who love b-movies and horror comedy alike army of darkness probably one finales bruce campbell hilariouse as good guy with attitude placing him in medievil times makes even better more gags than ridiculous hell i am an avid fan highly recommend this to anyone since humor
this movie has great graphics , gore and it's funny as hell . everything was made well one of my favorite movies
this movie was the tightest . animation and puppeteering outstanding bruce campbell is a great actor for role
this movie is the greatest comedy horror ever made . they combine cheesy with lots of slapstick there may not be much a plot but it still keeps your attention all together good
usually the original is best ; not this time . aod a great comedy starring bruce campbell
army of darkness in my mind is more a comedy than horror flick . it probably one sam raimi's best films even though there no real depth to the movie still considered be ultimate guy
nicholas cage and john travolta were awesome in this . i could really feel the pain of cage's character when he was good it makes you wonder about what would happen if situation possible
the best evil dead to date
sam raimi did a terrific with army of darkness , the third installment evil dead series . this horror\comedy went for more slapstick funny jokes which differed from its predecessors snappy dialogue by bruce campbell along visual effects makes best trilogy unlike most horror movies where bad guy returns one is based solely upon stupidity good movie even had decent plot that flowed well all events
not only the finest version of frankenstein i've ever seen,this was probably also one best movies any category.this follows story shelleys more closely and eschews cheap thrills worn out cinematic tricks to elevate into realm psychology philosophy- without detracting from spookiness iota.brilliant cinematography,excellent acting (it took me awhile recognize deniro!) that certain something really takes you there so many sadly lack.a must see for discerning connisseur quality horror or gothic themes .
this movie is great . the action graphics and special effects are just nice story plot , too
it is one of the best horror movies in my opinion . had a story to tell , lots action and even some emotions i loved !
yet another spin on the whole origin of vampire , a new history and take werewolf as well but at least this one gives story abetter beginning than old tired wolf bites human makes him . however breed werevamp is not my fav i thought they pulled it off surely could have made look better that! ! altogether think movie was great we can't wait for evolution!!
my kind of movie , plot line . well done interesting and still outrageous loved it
this movie was cool i like vanpier movies in one they were assholes .
a very well thought out movie exploring the vampire/liekens (werewolves to you and i) mythologies giving it new relationship . plot could have been filled little bit more , but what was there combined with action scenes sfx photography definately made up for
truly a modern classic and the best of trilogy . it brings out in george lucas steven speilberg harrison ford was born to play indiana jones if you have not seen this movie get your tomb
wow ! did you see this one ? i have seen it 9 times and is still good . recommend seeing movie while smoking pot really think are in the battlefield chopping arms legs aye
better than van helsing even though i've not seen that !
great movie with some awesome visuals . i liked the story as to why vampires wanted wipe out werewolves but enjoyed downfall of vampire lord most all whole was very well done
underworld was the best movie . second to lord of rings it so awsome !
good love story ala romeo juliette , some special effect a little overdone but still interesting plot therefore will not appeal to total blood and gore fanatics . acting flow music fit well movie for small children
this movie rocks . bar scene is great if it wasnt for high budget lost boys , would be the horror of 1987 i highly recommend to all fans scary
a good vampire movie .
for a truly different take on the vampire genre check out near dark . this movieis about cowboy who is bitten by female and must decide if he wanys to be human or vampire.lance henriksen(pumpkinhead) , bill paxton jenette goldstein star all three were in aliens2.this movie has some great action scenes non-dracula flick !
this was so cool when it came out cuz reminded me of the horror comic books i used to read . cockroach tale really bugged me.(i know couldn't help it)
i love most of the stories in this film evspecially something to tide you over that is soooooooo cool !
nice little touch with the horror movie and comic scene's . in a way this is funny it scary to degree also at same time great effects easy watch i recommend any buff
as action movies go , face/off provides excellent entertainment for the destruction entuhist . john travolta and nicholas cage have incredible lines quick guns are in a plot that is fascinating this movie rated highly anyone who loves to see suspense humor both actors wonderful performances
creepshow is a little collection of horror stories that are put together into movie . there three mini , father's day something to tide you over and the crate mediocre one pretty predictable other two completely original like tales from crypt episode my favorite which about some monster who realeased failed in thier attempt re-make but films will give scary fun time !
tell it to call you billie
this is a very cool movie ! i am not prejudiced in favor of it just because the bulk was filmed my hometown pittsburgh . even dated one featured actresses (i won't say who , but wasn't adrienne barbeau she still married to john carpenter at time!) only prejudice brought viewing film that have almost always enjoyed work nearly everyone involved written by stephen king ( shining  carrie christine ) and directed george romero night living dead dawn day creepshow scary funny stylish tribute horror comics '50's long an admirer romero's groundbreaking zombie trilogy contacted him around 1980 with idea working together on project various stories approaches were discussed including according feature comprised hour half's worth blackout sketches so relentlessly terrifying viewer would crawl out theater end decided best be set approximating style comic books both men had grown up which influenced their released fall 1982 result partnership worthy achievement consists five unrelated garish book are framed wraparound plot involving young boy named billy (joe stephen's real life son)whose bad tempered father (tom atkins)throw's boy's into trashcan worry-- takes his revenge true spooky yet somehow benign apparition outside billy's bedroom window beckons us world as wind blows lid off garbage can magazine has been thrown pages flip first story father's concerns nasty old man (jon lormer) murdered spinster daughter (viveca lindfors) returns from grave seven years later on...father's day!!...to exact entire equally family simple enough truly creepy walking corpse great next lonesome death jordy verrill himself performance think could managed plays jordy--a hick stupid mess meteor lands property cracks open begins ooze substance rather hilarious moment refers sh*t after he accidentally gets some within hours turn large fuzzy green plant segment moments weakest overall starts get tiresome before it's over things pick something tide you richard (leslie neilsen) arrogant producer nice seaside house (one few exteriors for obvious reasons.)and unhealthy interest home video (in people tape recorders or cameras they expensive.) videotapes uniquely devised murder unfaithful wife rebecca (gaylen ross) her lover harry (ted danson)--he buries them necks below high line private beach when goes back deal bodies they're gone ? hmmmm.. crate janitor horlick's university finds forgotten wooden under stairwell markings side contains specimens arctic expedition last century well question quite hungry having anything eat hundred happens school's professors (adrienne barbeau) he'd like rid good balance suspense humor likeable performances hal holbrook henpecked henry fritz weaver progressively hysterical (he keeps seeing mangled thing inside crate)professor stanley finally eg marshall gives essentially one-man opposite huge cockroaches creeping evil foulmouthed tycoon upson pratt lives alone own neuroses sterile electronically controlled penthouse apartment except bugs keep coming nowhere ever increasing numbers midst thunderstorm power fails sealed fears most guaranteed fun fans its tense somewhat violent times taking too seriously those usually put movies sit enjoy original poster said : you'll being scared that's probably

and not just cause johnny depp is beautiful
a good scare---better if watched at -pajama party @ 3 am !
absolutely amazed . this one flew under the radar maybe a cult classic day
am i the only one that noticed stephen king wrote original short story ? *rage!*yes johnny's a great actor but was adictive and ending amazing !
does johnny depp do a bad movie??? ? maybe not.. .
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was thrilled at the plot twists .
how can i complain about a movie showcasing johnny depp ? okay , the plot was bit thin but mr depp's character is fascinating and complex .
it isn't even out in the uk but i can sense will be good . mean has johnny depp , what more do you need ?
the ending was awesome ! mort's madness and cruelty creates ultimate beauty of lonelyness .
in my opinion it just barely gets 5 stars . it's a great movie very innovative and travolta cage do excellent jobs playing both the good guy bad an that you have to see
this movie kicked ass ! the whole time i was on edge of my seat . story awesome writer had a good flow and concept perfectly horrific love idea cheating death resulting (new) future in which characters are chased by order they were seated plane if you have never seen , it is definitely worth your time!!!
i liked it !
a great movie to wach .
what can i say ? loved this movie !
the bom !!!! !
i loved it..plaus devon sawa..yummy !
this movie scared the crap out of me
how can you not like this movie?? ? the characters are great . plot excellent i mean everyone who was on movie theater jumped at least once only that did to me know waht last summer
nicolas cage and john travolta worked perfectly together . woo , as always did a superb job director the story though very unlikely is interesting different original fun action scenes bring dramatic art-like experience score adds to overall
this was a great movie which just left me in suspense . it well thought out story and couldn't have had better ending
final destination made me jump outta' my seat- literally ! it keeps you in suspense . when you're watching , have to expect the unexpected
that is one of the best suspense movie i ever saw !
this was a great movie . there were really cool visual effects and an edge of your seat storyline to keep you interested both john nicholas did excellent acting job as well keeping the see it !
i saw this movie a little while ago and it's hella good . you never know what's going to happen it had shocking off guard parts think is worth seeing twice
this movie kept you at the edge of your seat from beginning to end ! throughout there were many surprises . is like a roller coaster ride you'd want over and again
this is a great movie that makes you feel like you're on roller coaster . i jumped at every scene because they always popped out with surprises for people over 13 becasue the story plot really good and thought of very smart
this might be the scariest movie i have ever seen . it seemed like was jumping out my seat every few minutes
one of the best films it's time mel gibson was exellent .
i thought this movie was full of action . and all the special effects stunts made it more interesting to watch
i thought the movie was great because it had a plot that have never heard of before . when saw must jumped about six times liked way went one and made you think over , then something else happens to make jump
finally , something besides the cookie-cutter teeny-bopper slasher movies.. . a new idea gasp shock ! they really worked with element of suspense twas quite well done...
great plot , very well done with the structuring of movie . i recommend this to everyone ending it was kind funny and ironic overall outstanding
great movie . it has you thinking the whole way through plot twists and turns in directions would'nt have thought if don't get flashbacks , you're not paying enough attention one of best movies year
loved it even if was just for the ending , i never once thought about guy on floor . recomend this to anyone
this movie scared the crap out of me and so did second one , i deffinately loved it.. : )
face/off was a great movie . it interesting how the face exchange worked scene that i liked end , off between two guys storyline good too they lived their rivals lives
this movie desreves a 10 it has very random and intresteing storyline for horror when they revel the killer is unexpected i havent seen like that in years .
i like blade because my favorate actor is wesely snipes and also it effects good to watch wistler
i think face/off was a good movie . my favorite part when they had the operation and to act like each other
i absolutely loved this - wasn't too keen on the second one though . film seems to stay true graphic novel and it was great having stephan dorff back into a main role , he's so good at being bad guy effects were well done visually impressive
i love this one and the seconed to great plot a black batman .
love this film not really a vampire movie but an action with vampires in it . awsome opening the nightclub that firmly estabishes blade as kick butt take no prisoners type of character very close to comics great use music and fight scenes something mortal kombat tried yet failed do also loved steven dorff decon frost blade's fahter he is perfect his performance(cool dresser) even cooler sense meance don't give crap attiude only kiefer sutherland played bad
john travolta played a good part in face/off . hands down this gets 5
blade had great special effects . the movie made me believe that there are really vampires out
it is the most bloodiest movie there and it's scary . every time i see get scared
this movie was hella cool . the fight scenes were tight , but storyline kind of dumb
i think that blade was one of the best movies i've ever seen . it had a lot action and horror how he half vampire really tight
i love this movie . it wasn't really horror , more like action made me wanna be a vampire
it is one of the bloodiest movies i have ever seen . wesley snipes a very good actor he needs to come out with blade 2 , 3 4 5 they will be tight
this is a fast paced thriller . it cool idea and good adaptation from the comic book acting special effects are great
this is a great movie . lots of action story i liked the ending , especially all fight scenes guys were cool too
the jumping out of your seat factor was low . but effects were off hook! !
i loved this movie ! at first it was hard to understand but then caught on quickly . jam packed with action and had a really good plot
blade was one of the tightest movies i've ever seen . all action and gore with tight beats made a great mixture
pure action . the best vampire movie ever , love supense and very original could have been a team called blade
blade was the best horror movie i seen this year .
it has non-stop action . was very clever of them to find a way lift the skin off face also , casting perfect
great horror/comedy .
wooooo such a great movie i will keep this forever
la mejor comedia-gore que v en mi vida , de lejos insuperada . injustamente relegada por crtica un clsico toda ley
not as good the orginal flick , but this is a 5 star it same concept of first movie people are inside borded up and dead trying to eat there brains .
it deffinatly met my expectations
if i could pick more stars then would . what dont understand is how a movie like stigmata be compared to night of the living dead , great plot decent acting amazing effects are really only thing that people seem complain about but do you expect from low budget movie..
mr . pink has this movie discription down perfect it is a great low-buget among my top ten i try to watch anytime get chance first watched at friends house the later rented and all 5 nights also highly reccomend anyone who good sense of humor well likes movies send more police.. -smart zombie
this has to be my all time favorite horror movie . i wouldn't really call it as much would comedy is hilariouse cannot describe you the depths of dark humor reached in dare say ingeniouse film an un credited classic and if ever have chance rent or buy do ! gaurantee will laugh your ass off what keeps going great dialouge surprisingly good ensemble acting some funniest scenes brilliant quotes come out a since army darkness , highly recomended more brains!!
face/off can be summed up in two words- john woo . anything directed by him is gonna' good that church scene with the doves dope
it all begins in a medical supply warehouse where burt is training new recruit freddy the ways of running business . discussion eventually leads to mentioning few barrels being stored basement according , they contain corpses that had at one time been reanimated you see night living dead was based on an actual event somehow group scientists accidentally created gas revives military these cannisters and shipped them only problem got wrong place fortunately emergency phone number stenciled unfortunately owner never bothered call decide visit take look end up puncturing causing body inside melt thereby releasing well this facility what do suppose might be storing walk-in freezer upstairs ? oh yes cadaver we were introduced earlier alien writer dan o'bannon makes his directing debut with hilarious violent sendup zombie flicks beginning above mentioned isolated situation whose solution creates even larger film progresses until entire town overwhelmed by walking takes any elements from romero's series gives twist zombies are no longer stumbling into walls fact appear rather intelligent when woman escapes hiding locker particular attaches door handles miniature crane proceeds rip doors off they're also smart enough figure out how use cb acquire more food picky too don't want just piece human flesh brains as stated previously parody while does violence requisite horror sort focuses comedy realistic if underdeveloped characters make profanity-laden dialogue genuinely funny other situations such trash(linnea quigley) giving short essay worst way die which striptease(all taking cemetery) good moments black nevertheless love not required enjoy there many laugh thing turn some viewers level it's excessive but placed effects will have squeamish glancing floor hand quite amusing admit watching two guys restrain formerly third hits head pickaxe(which has effect shape add) downright whether like you're going those who scared needn't worry most timid viewer find anything afraid here
i saw this film when was ten years old and it literally frightened the crap out of me ! couldn't take my eyes off no matter how full pants got (just kidding!) has some best special effects i've seen on an cheesy eighties zombie flick . to those who have : wasn't that slimy in basement most real frightening thing movie ? for haven't if you're looking be entertained don't mind being grossed a little , rent film! course let's not forget r.l.d pt.ii sequel is almost as good first one opinion more comical!
i love this movie , do has to be the most entertaining have ever seen never laughed so hard or had such a great time watching . would go into detail about all things absolutely but if you're reading and you havent it dont want ruin for miss oppertunity watch highly recomend
this movie is the most entertaining thing i've ever seen . if anything it gets better besides obvious hilariousness of film has a bit spook factor what legion unstoppable zombies were to attack your town ending so perfect , too i recommend watching with big tasty donut happened ? why #6? ! guess some people just don't see genious in dialouge and everyhting oh well
this has to be the greatest movie i have ever had opportuninty of seeing . not only is it perfect horror it's funny ! a great watch w/ group friends and would never miss chance see thorne , mr pink tarman know what they're talking about everything say just repeat they've already said.i highly recomend return living dead everyone who gets
this is one of the best low-budget films i have ever seen . not only does movie keep right on going in bizzare yet pefect blend horror and comedy that keeps your eyes glued to t.v screen , has great dialouge surprisingly good acting neglected mention its incredible ending perfect for highly recomended a definate classic
brilliant
the best horror of 80's . what storylines lacks , movie makes up for in sheer
i liked the action in this movie . it also had a very good storyline scenes were interesting
what a trend setter
scary movie....hellraiser is awesome in all the above .
this is the most frightening concept imaginable ! looking into hell on film . top 5 best ever
geezes this was scary holy crap i find it hard to rent man the guy coming out of floor god
dope gore with a good plot . every movie in the story is great who doesn't love clive barker ? see this and all four bloodline best
this is probably one of the greatest horror movies ever , and not an exaggeration . only does it have intelligent story some most gruesome effects but well worked-out characters on both sides which makes superior to mere splatter like friday 13th series or films dawn dead that's what film very recommendable watch even more than once
i like all of the hellraisers except last one .
awwwww the gremlin is so cute awwwwww i just want to hug u and squeeze love me where a happy family with great big kiss from wont say ull too kisss
mel gipson : great actor + director = awesome movie
the movie was intense . it action packed from beginning to end john travolta plays a great villian sequences were tight
those acts of god really stick it in and break off dont they ?
one of the cooolest and dirtiest vampire films ever made ! i love this movie for it's originality , brytallity crudness . film doesn't care what hell you think it is here to be give those who pleasur hate emence disaproval marvel at work that had have gone into makeing a horror inventive frantic written by master original brilliant hardcore scripts robert rodriguiz fearless risk taker when comes taking on different styles bring edge your seat action extraviganza life death find its unrelenting gore humor refreshing change pace from todays scream movies know did last summers highly recommended couse like most tarintino stuff isn't everyone.but out there can keep minds open crazy,psycho,sicko will adore
f#####g awesome best remake ever of a hooror so far .
john travolta and nicholas cage were phenomenal . the plot twists in movie excellent i enjoyed very much
my husband and i own this movie we , along with in-laws absolutely love it . is by far one of our favorites recommend to anyone who likes horror movies
excellent modern day adaptation of the classic movie . they don't bother with a moral message it's just straight ahead violence and gore horror fans should love it
nicholas cage and john travolta , what more could you ask for ? two of the greatest actors in movie . this was a great
good film , avoid the sequels like plaque especially part 2 .
great movie thorne see it again ?
well thought out movie- has comedy , suspense drama action and so on . it's created to be a fast paced movie that keeps you the edge of your seat also people who played characters are known
unrated version . custard scene what else is there ?
absolutely awesomely over the top gory fun . never really scary...the blood and gore are soooo abundant , it's almost cartoonish but a bizzare often humorous gorefest not for everyone..
a very funny and bloody zombie movie !
this is good science fiction outside the modern slash and splatter mode . has a plot story charlton heston great here
great , a little creepy and tense... .
creepy !
an excellent movie starring william katt , george wendt(tv show cheers) richard moll(tv night court) alan autry (played a cop on the tv heat of night) and hideous sandywitch . one funniest horror movies all time far better than crap today
i think that this was good as far the thrill and suspense . give a 5 because really it action packed thought movie worth seeing
micheal rules !
awsome follwup nowhere near as good the first one but how can it be rent now
it just keeps you interested throughout the whole movie . a lot of great twist
awesome
watching part of this movie on hbo , i thought : not even the most pathetic hopeless drooling-all-over-his-overalls-and-not-even-caring-idiot could find any merit in it at all . was wrong
face/off is dope . nicholas cage a good actor every scene interesting , always has action in it very dramatic
i think said : what the hell like 6 times during this movie because of twisting plot time after . is just frieken messed up love it
wow . unbelievable great suspense , acting plot twist it's mind-boggling creative and inventive as far horror flicks go this one is top-of-the-line
i actually saw this movie twice -- once alone , then later with a friend . both times was held in suspense and utterly amazed at the cleverness of film general cast works well together end is great surprise !
the ending was such a good surprise .
it was like psycho meets silence of the lambs
if you want a horror movie more concerned with story than blood and guts , then identity is definitely worth your while . finally there's scary out there without some superhuman madman going on murderous rampage great performances from an ensemble cast carry this beginning to end through few plot twists that won't see coming overall entertaining will leave lasting impression!! !
face/off is a dope ass movie . nicholas cage one of the best actors in my opinion there should have been some sex it though
whoa . that was my first thought at the end of identity this movie able to keep attention with it's brillant cast and many plot twists a time i had figured out only have whole process blown away when something new happened john cusack did an excellent job playing lead role , all supporting characters were round well it is freaky in more realistic sense would recommend anyone who wants see scary
before halloween and it's many rip offs , there was black christmas . a real classic
it can be so hard to watch such a scary film as this one , and is well done .
many offer halloween as the classic against which all stalker movies should be compared , but four years earlier black christmas a minor exemplary effort succeeded in being far creepier and avoided of former's failings . telephone scenes are unnerving killer truly scary ending is superlative with terrifying coda it strains credulity sometimes terrific use setting especially snowbound canadian campus admirable character development (so it's not anna karenina ; how horror films actually give attention to characters?) make for highly recommended well historically important terror film olivia hussey gives standout performance margot kidder steals her andrea martin makes an impact non-comedic role definitely outshines its knockoffs
this is my favorite entry in the 10-film series . i like all of them really , though one just has much more atmosphere than most others
this film has the spooky camp feel like part one , which is what i love in a friday 13th . not only it fun movie to watch but features hot chick with perfect butt ! you guys that have seen movie,you know i'm talking about way jasons face looks at end of whole deformed wild man woods really beliveable and scary out for skinny goofy looking guy named ted funny just look he does some fuuny sh*t bar scene best if your drunk or high on we*d two thumbs up
gory , hot babes with nice butts... .
it suprised me''''
nicholas cage is perhaps one of the greatest actors now and my favorites . besides this , almost any nick movie good full great gunfights backstabbing that makes fun to watch
jason forever and beyond
greatest horror saga of all time .
damn ian snyder {jake richardson} is hot in that movie!i loved it i have watched each wknd sinc got w/ different friends and everyone of them said he was really when goth at the end wish could been chrustal movie good!!!!i think jake should come to spokane washington since where film filmed want see him !
hangman's curse is the best movie ever ! ian so hott jake richardson only when he's dressed like a goth .
it was sooooooooooooooooo good . jake looked hot in it! ! they should have more goth pics of him on the net i cant find them n/e where
hella good movie . kept me watching , never a dull moment lots of action !
jake is hot in his goth suit!! ! best movie ever , hard to understand by yourself the 1st time you watch it so twice (that must be why i2kdave didn't like it.. . he's probably too out there movie) any ways don't miss cause it's a very important show if know what i meen
hangman's curse tells it all ! we always get picked on for the way look and dress im sick of it..it doesnt make us different from anyone because where not gangsta out killing people or preppy getting our nails done i love this movie ian is sexy abyl fry one us!
it was the best film i've seen & to make better jake richardson is gorg
i know jake richardson is cute but only in that movie...like dangerous lives of a alter boy he wasnt all that...but to be the school setting was totally fake come on think if u had under ground cult ppl would know!but cryed when ian snyder tried kill himself envy crystal cuz she him movie whaaaa!!!!!!!!!! !
this movie was the best ! i thought jake richardson a total hunk . now i'm bit obsessive with him but thats all cool hehe good jumping type shows how some ppl do get picked on loved it an totally deserves 5 star
this is an amazing film very gothic i would recomend it to everyone including goths . the deep and can relate ian snyder (jake richardson) because get treated badly aswell watching hangman's curse really helped me realize that im am not only goth who gets thanks for reading
this movie is very popular among 1)death row inmates 2)juvenile sex offenders and 3)metamphetamine addicts who dropped out of junior high school to pursue a career as male prostitutes . in fact , the only entire world that may be better than one hellraiser
this was my favorite movie . i loved the special effects actors john travolta and nicholas cage are wonderful worth seeing over again
''''scaryness''''
very good . it is creepy you ill be affraid of dolls after see its actually funny somtimes
i thought face/off was a great movie because the concept of very unique . it kept me entertained throughout whole only thing didn't like about that dragged little too long at end when they were trying to kill each other
the first one was great....as usual with most horror sequels .
this is the scariest movie , chucky actor . i can't believe it there should have been more stuff than
a great film and packs plenty of thrills
child's play is one of the scariest movies i've ever watched . i really like it because was unique
this movie is a classic . when i was young sacred as hell of and now watch it , more humorous to me can over
this movie had a lot of action in it . the story plot was able to keep my attention and special effects were cool
the movie was rivoting . it my most favorite when i a child still watch to this day
beter than the last one!! !
scream 2 was much better than the first film , as got pretty predictable after half of movie . however this one quite a shocker i had no idea that either mickey or debbie salt would be killer suspected maybe not who she said but never billy loomis's mother overall good followup to origional very well done !
if you missed this action movie , never watched an .
hip , funny and scary sequel to the first . believable performances good soundtrack great direction ideas make this a worth while film starts out with bang (killing jada pinkett-smith was hillarious...she did really job) is all way through another scene sarah michelle gellar (she always seems best of her pretty blonde girl large boosum roles) running deserted serority house only be thrown off roof...damn !
as far entertainment goes , both scream movies are pretty much neck and . but the best film of two is definately this one ! perfect example what a modern-day horror movie all about along with silence lambs probably 90s if you ask me
it's my favorite of the scream trilogy . i just hate dewey..
this movie sucks so badly that i can't explain it . neve kills yet another role but randy's character saved a little bit of the he's great give him five rest was pitiful though
it's much better than a lot of the crappy movies ahead it .
i just love malcovich and defoe
superb film with excellent performance by dafoe .
john malkovich is terrific , as willem dafoe . i had to study nosferatu in a film studies class and so it was lot of fun see this version the story also liked honesty about drug problems that were rampant time seems be forgotten when glorified other films
loved it every way imaginable : acting , photography set costumes score plot . it's all there and makes for a compelling nosferatu trilogy with the 1921/22 1979 versions of classic vampire film
i really enjoyed this movie . the casting of willem dafoe as hungry max shrek was absolutely inspired though he perfect in every movement , word shadow vampire had it's share horror and comedy (yet another choice giving eddie izzard a supporting role) balanced them together very complimentarily(is that ? oh well is now.) john malkovich too often annoying actor devoid overly enunicated type acting seems to favor which made him all more entertaining watch catherine mccormack almost unrecognizable doomed heroine from her 'dangerous beauty' days film informative not mention clever intelligent must see
two brilliant actors . a fresh dark and cleverly written script great directing what does it equal ? box office bomb as well genuinly thought provoking memorable film the power hypnotic precense of this is given substance by director willem dafoes legendary performance one that will never ever be topped movie flat out beautiful true work art must see
i cannot wait to see this but have chosen live in a small rural town so guess will for video or hope it comes the biggest around here , burlington vt . fat chance
this movie was pure genious!!!! ! go see it and you will know what i am talking about . out
story-wise , my expectations of this movie somewhat exceeded what i saw today . in spite that still think is a very well done piece work malkovich was - always surreal and compelling experience his character murnau's dissent into madness complete he did fine job conveying before only means judging eddie izzard s talents by wonderful standup routine which so good am led to believe underused part but it hope see him on the big screen again there are no words adequately describe depth depravity debased horror willem dafoe able capture instill nosferatu all depictions vampires have seen movies over years been many dafoe's most bone chillingly horrifying truly deserves highest recognition for film addition photography creative costumes realistic true 1921 makeup phenomenal they get nominations wins deserve oscar night
whatever john malkovich is in always turns out great . shadow of the vampire isn't your everyday giant budget jump pants horror flick takes you behind making nosferateu course played by william dafoe who believe it or not should get nominated for an oscar i have seen so many movies and having to do with vampires but really got into his character he did excellent job portraying a dark figure little comedy again hits us brillant performance which plays director original movie  when ends don't know weather love him hate search down theatre find where because its definetly all people must see if appreciate acting
an excellent , moody king adaptation brilliantly directed (by david cronnenberg whose films i usually do not enjoy) and acted by all . chris walken martin sheen herbert lom anthony zerbe brooke adams tom skerritt--all a little episodic but chilling (martin as psychopathic president ; quite west wing material) one of the best
walken is super in this made-for-him role . a disturbing picture with the viewer finding themselves hurting for johnny music score and movie compelling chilling at times great
one of my favorite stephen king movies . christopher walken and martin sheen are really great in this film
i think it is a tribute to the set designers , photographers and gibson as director that people complain about historical accuracy of this superior epic film . clearly presentation looked so realistic some story was meant be equally not exactly true ; william wallace legend subject here history legendary leader in scotland much same way davy crockett us both have had their deeds exaggerated any case braveheart one finest films ever seen also most exciting satisfying
so very creepy . dario argento does a great job with this one of my favorite horror films to date , and film hands down the score is amazingly effective !
this movie was utterly terrifying!! ! it's not like the slasher movies that we normally think of when someone suggests a thriller , but it preys on viewer psychologically . sometimes that's even more frightening than blood and gore powerful so scary i can't look at river forest now without getting chill
alice is a twisted 12 year old violently jealous of her younger sister(brooke shields)in this absorbing , atmospheric slasher movie . the setting late 50s new jersey creepiness things captured lovingly in small details and great location photography an almost coen bros tone monstrous landlord(you will never forget character once you see him his antique-stuffed apartment surrounded by kittens eating out catfood cans looking like 500 pound john turturro.)50s catholic environment creepily smartly evoked paula e sheppard perfect as nasty way she sticks tongue to receive communion ! gore slight with only 3 stalk-and-stab scenes lot gushing blood finale though could call classic its type since it far above average 70s maniac category.if ya smelllll what shape roasting!!
they dont make em like this no more .
bloody and funny too !
great movie , this is definately carpenter's best and brightest . will be a classic for years to come
naturalistic and suspensefull as hell . john boorman's one great movie , far i know stellar work from voight ned beatty burt reynolds of all things
this is truly the only horror movie to give me nightmares . most well written , thought out in ages john carpenter at his best whole concept of itself frightening imagine it happening you would blow anyone's mind casting was excellent and played nothing will ever top my book so few people have seen which really a shame brother (musicprof) i tell everyone we know that they should watch someone hold filmfest halloween every town country play one as opener noone want leave there seat for popcorn
this is the only horror movie to ever cause me nightmares ! story of a writer who actually writes into existence his own demons . twists and turns in extraordinary well deserving veiwing... if you dare!
fulci is a god . this the epitomy of zombie movies all others should bow to i remember seeing movie at drive in theatre , and it scared me lifeless that young age watching now still brings back chills please rate film higher cause if there was hall fame for horror would be first year shoein
classic fulci italian horror . all i have to say is , splinter in the eye
i wish this movie was seen by more people but it never really got a market . is one of my alltime favorites ! creepy , suspenseful and the music perfect nothing like an undertaker with seemingly super power strength evil purpose another in lines rosemary's baby (not storyline type) that they don't get you special effects so much as do just plain suspense.......
wow! ! when i started watching this could tell that it was going to be a wonderful movie you know how tell? ? by the awesome music like sound of . it's great have horror has dead people and slashing in it! love imaginitive scenes tall man rocks! movies about sinister-cemetaries flim is one truely uses flying spheres kill which very imaginative way killing whole thing seems fantasy but , real ending scared me tremendously! that's what loved my favorite all time got do with supernatural world so next your walking through video store grab phantasm rent cause movie! remember great!!!!!
you sher gotta purty mouth boy . aaaaaahhhhh!!!! !
yikes !
the tall mister killing and got toilets go!! !
i was 15 when first saw this movie , and can tell you it scared the crap out of me . year 1980 only a few movies up to that point had same demonistic quality truly horror clasic
what can i say , grew up on this movie . even though the makes no sense and everyones actions' motive is questionable it keeps you watching again maybe its hope that will one day figure out who tall man ? where does he come from every town in rest of world a ghost are all those midget-monk things at desert or hell what?there too many questions about movies to lists thinking my head hurt brought us hemicuda.argumentavly strangest ever made but definate classic highly recomended
incoherent , yes - but sometimes that's a good thing . this movie still stands out as unique 20+ years later even when compared to the sequels and rip-offs main message of is hope that more determined youths can muster resources film their stupid ideas untainted by studio or audience expectation basking in other people's creativity we become less afraid our own
judge this movie purely on the first time you see it , and is a classic(just think of your thoughts when watched it) there was no demon coming back after they killed him . he just got what wanted won(and i jumped couple times only thing that dissapointed me about waited so long to
the first one was good.. .
a classic . what could be scarier than being pursued in the wilderness by group of bloodthirsty , rapist rednecks ? soundtrack this movie had such profound effect on me that every time i see confederate flag one those long back / short side haircuts or other symbols redneck hear dueling banjos my mind.. squeal like piggy boy - now is terror
i love the movies were jason place in them!!!! !
good movie and a nice directorial effort by bill paxton . but the abuse of older boy his well-meaning father was very hard to take gut wrenching note : younger two boys has lead in latest remake peter pan
a great movie...pretty interesting !
one of the creepiest and most suspenseful films to come out in last decade . i found this film be amazingly good with a kick-ass script , cast solid directing it addresses real issue religious fanaticism how far people will go do what they believe is god's work  bill paxton's character seemingly normal when night he wakes his two sons up inform them that an angel came visit him told was mission rid world all demons (those guilty horrible things- i.e child killers murderers etc) performance first class manages put on very chilling also impressed newcomer matt o'leary domestic disturbance fame as always matthew mccoughnahey gave great narrator who tells story edge your seat-type thriller from start finish highly reccomended !
this was a really great movie ! scary suspenceful , anything you could ask for
the faculty is one of best horror films recent years....brilliant
robert deniro is as ususal very good at what he does . this movie scared the hell out of me
that is grand!!!! !
angela is also one of my favorite slasher killers . so original , different from most your standard issue horror movies the 80's she was just misunderstood only wanted to have a good time with happy campers
i happen to love this movie and the sequels that followed . twisted train of thought put into has be admired maybe camera work was less than perfect , lighting wasn't best amatuer acting difficult at times but story will carry you end if let it requires some thinking follow as read below people don't participate in function while watching movies really is a great film leave laughing give little thrill well
one of the more actual scary mavies that has come out recently . honestly , how may horror movies actually scare you and make jump ?
this one scared me . i enjoyed it very much worth seening more than ounce if you enjoy a truly scary movie
well acted , and horrifying.......a real "ghost" story one of the few with a plot an academy award winning actor .
what a great scary movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
the first time i saw it,it freaked me out !
the ghosts were so wicked .
i think this movie was just really interesting . kind of hard to understand and the images ghosts were actually scarier than itself as far scariness goes , my 12 year old brother watched it said wack but that monk,(tony shalhoub) great in such a different role i'm used seeing him
one of those films that sucks you in with its great atmosphere and feeling , or on the other hand just dont get it think dumb . i this is an excellent film delivers goods suspense
an intelligent film not really a horror rather more of thriller with alot suspense thrown in . still it manages to scare you on thinking level pretty good preformances i've only just seen this less than year ago and enjoyed loved the brit eklund dancing scene very arousing especially if consider from constable's point view all his repression such nicely done
word to the wise , if you see christopher lee wearing one of cher's old wigs start running . and britt ekland is most underrated actress our time even they had dub her
great movie with a plot ! everything in this rocks . juliette lewis plays good character as does nick nolte very creepy and it stays you after see
david lynch is a god of film making .
the birth of a baby in post apocalyptic society brings about disturbing images . forced to take care child he doesn't want and is repulsed by , father loses his sanity or what was left it blows your mind dies you can't tell if that's worst thing
david lynch is great! !
i can't wait for joyride2 !
any movie with leelee sobieski is bound to be good . she a brilliant , fantastic looking actress who always adds touch of class the itself does little expand horror genre instead relying on tired old cliches create an atmosphere tension highly predictable but enjoyable
martin scorcese and deniro are at it again with an almost hitchcock theme of terror . i believe both deserved the oscar made me want to root for bad guy juliette lewis is a hot lolita too
very good movie made almost perfect by the use of disembodied and distinctive voice actor ted levine as rusty nail . (uncredited) great casting
i loved it !
i never want to go in a corn patch again!! !
i love this movie . the main reason why is because you get to see paul walker's bare naked booty sign me up ! but other than that , it also was very suspensful and kept at edge of my seat think had a couple nightmares really scared end when guy's voice came on radio thought they would have joy ride 2 hope so
very entertaining !
the best thriller to come out in ages . i thought films like this had died a long time ago joy ride has proven me wrong film crouched my chair and biting nails through some of coolest suspence filled moments have ever experienced would go as far compare hitchcock perfect blend hard edged humor heart pounding terror make one thrillers seen great cast an original story well beautiful directing help bring full speed life steve zahn is excellent usual paul walker prooves himself be fairly good action type leelee sobeieski makes most underwritten yet believable role (anyone else notice her high beams are on about every damn shot???) that relies sheer rather than bloody stump alfred once said , want torture audience much possible believe you will tortured wonderful ways imaginable deliverse goods highly recommended !
i watched that and almost peaed my pants .
i loved this movie not scary but very well done
very good film . great acting on all sides and a wonderful job of scaring you (for once) without cutting things open left right they scare with the fear what might happen , by playing your mind drawing it out now that's horror/thriller
one of my person favorite horror movies , much better then most others before it on this list . sarah michelle gellar and anne heche are the stand outs show stealing every scene that they in probably wasn't smartest thing to waste all their amunition a knock out chase between fisherman killer which leaves you edge your seat throughout leave nothing for climax still great film with lots pretty people !
this movie was also extremely scary . robert deniro excellent as a psychotic killer i still check under my car and in the back seat before get it at night
this movie was just bad ass . not too scary but enough and entertaining
this movie made me jump in terror . there were moments when i was so scared couldn't even look at the screen
this movie was a very good one , except for the beginning when nothing happened it too long! ! scenes ocean on dark night back alley i know darkness adds to atmosphere of but you can't see anything . say should have more light
i love this movie . it was so scary ! when you watch a pay money to , want feel like that worth the time and is it!
nolte and deniro are among our best living actors . was amazing , stayed true to the 1950 version with robert mitchom
i'm not sure if this piece of art should be classified as a horror or thriller movie . never the less , robert deniro was excellent in his attempt to take law into own hands
my favorite movie of all times! ! i loved the cast this . jennifer love hewitt's tremendous performance propelled her to stardom was very scary and hip
i love this movie since was kid one of my favorite horror movies . even baught the replica christine
ok pre-wwii film noir flick staring jack nicholson as a hard-boiled private eye getting in way over his head .
this is one my favorite movies . it has everything , comedy romance gore drama shaun and ed are so likeable you can't help but be amused by them cant classified as pure horror though
i believe this is one of the top five movies ever made . if it has any flaws , cannot see them and have seen over thirty times polanski directs a masterpiece nicholson masterful subduing his usual performance rest cast superb as well written movie i've amusing to called over-rated by people whose literary cinematic tastes appear be at grade seven level comprehension ah different strokes....
creepy !
scared the crap out of me !
scerd me
in a time where all we were getting is crappy scream and urban legend blah-blah-blah , this one actually turned out to be pretty good .
the special effects and plot had me hooked , it spawned a huge interest in sanitariums/asylums for . ending wasn't all that great i heard this movie is remake vincent price was original ? dunno about
this movie gives you everything ; horror , sadness and hatred i justlove it
this was my favorite of these movies though it probably the worst made . i just liked 3d effect
'chinatown' is my personal favorite of all-time . to this day , the performances john huston as noah cross and jack nicholson detective jake gittes are memorable any ever conceived on film however tragic quality faye dunaway's evelyn mulwray what makes movie such a monument in filmmaking further enduring because how it mocks audience's childish hopes for happy ending maybe not greatest but definitely noir period
an easy close second to the first film in series . a nice original plot putting last children of elm street all one little asylum crazies and heather langencamp john saxon return not mention always pretty patricia arquette
released in 1974 , roman polanski's chinatown is a film noir feature that studied most if not all schools . for the uninitiated story involves complex scheme to control water supply 1930's los angeles ex-cop private detective j.j gittes (jack nicholson) gets involved when one of loose ends go astray and eventually hired by mysterious woman evelyn mulwray (faye dunaway) gittes' investigation reveals something more rotten denmark than simple domestic matter he meets industrialist noah cross (john huston) who attempts frighten him off case as closer putting clues place truth finally revealed ugly perhaps best kept secret there little anything anyone can do undertones dialogue cinematography are flat dark which impeccably match themes greed debauchery while huston dunaway excellently cast carried nicholson somehow tones down his usual bigger life persona great effect movie tied together continual references proverbial unexplainable world form or other words what it's ? bottom line this action oriented but requires effort ; however appreciate cinema complete art must see
this movie has a great script and very exciting action scene . i loved the way freddie crouger was brought to life
and the oscars go to jeepers creepers for makeup special effects!! !
best movie ever made imho . first time i saw it , chills ran up and down my spine when jake's assistant says to him forget jake its chinatown what a great ending
van helsing was sexy . dracula mr hyde vaguely familiar this a good movie
this movie put me in mind of all the horror flicks that i loved as a kid . it's b-movie genre and it though not for everyone , you really have to appreciate art form here would watch over
the best ditective movie of all time ! my 6th favorite . incredably smart and funny in a messed up kind way great acting music very good
saw this movie three times . it is lots of fun and the werewolf great ! highly recommend if you like vampires werewolfs
this is a fantastic movie!! ! great special effects , lovable and funny characters real adventure ride . hugh jackman brilliant as van helsing kate beckinsale gorgeous sexy always all up it's movie experience must see on the big screen you will enjoy it from beginning to end i promise
it may not be entirely accurate but is still one of the best movies out there . an epic about a man from lowlands scotland who challenges king england for love his deceased wife dramatic movie those that are intelligent enough to see drama
amazingly charismatic work by nicholson . legendary script robert towne classic downer ending roman polanski irresistable one caveat : this is not a movie for idiot couch potatoes you have to pay attention the information spoon fed
a horror movie for those who hate slasher flicks . this is one of wes craven's finest voodoo and witchery at it's best bill pullman exceeds his normal acting skills the supporting cast does well also my favorite lines all time... don't let them bury me... i'm not dead!! ! awesome
just cause its about jack the ripper , does that really make it a horror film ?
i must highly recommend this movie if you are into the jack ripper mystery at all . it took theory that like most , and put a slight twist on also came from alan moore's great hell comic series which is what initially got me interested check them out liked
they use this script as part of the required text in screenwriting classes . 'nuf said
this movie had a lot working against it from before was made . first , it's one of those films that tries to fit an immense body literature into celluloid vehicle (the graphic novel the same name by comics giant alan moore who also wrote legendary watchmen  which i took comedian) reading beforehand doesn't help at all with ; only fuels oh they should have done game people like me play while are watching but would helped dissatisfied customers understand what filmmakers were up or for carried through surreally dark atmosphere comes on paper in as squiggly lines interaction text and image there create imagination reader over-the-top melancholia seem complain about may been result their trying translate tons bio historical pictures supposed be able convey thousand words each film notoriously unable do instance show joe merrick elephant man bit book dr gull meets him explains how india is believed incarnation god ganesha when he prospers land withers just king arthur later we see british empire wane commits suicide walks acquintance around westminster ancient masonic significance construction certain forms images subtly affect men's minds kind effect come well smokestacks eviscerations if suggestion isn't there's feeling power despite its flaws can't count number times asked knew coming out dvd ultimately will probably contribute moore's frustration not being understood illusion uniqueness his storytelling ability
one of the best movies 2001 . a bit over top but entertaining (for adults) and well conceived
one of the coolest movies ever ! jack nicholson was robbed an oscar . this film will blow your mind
awesome movie ! real scary!
los angeles of the 1930's has never looked so enchanting , or dangerous . nicholson gives a blistering performance as private eye j.j gihes one my favorite films all time it is perfect example noir film style story will leave your mouth hanging open
i can give this movie high ratings because it had a good plot and liked the whole but thought was going to be scary . wasn't is must see very acting done by kim basinger little girl
the booooommmmmm
great movie , dialogue story . it had a big twist at the end with daughter and faye dunaway
i loved it..plus jonathan cherry is in it and love that canadian!! !
go see this movie . the special effects in are best ever created while first one had plain , ordinary deaths superb ! its more silly than i dont want to give away on here but if you really know how they die just leave me a personal message
great acting all around , portman is captivating and the confrontation with police at end one of my favorites showdowns in cinema .
i always liked this movie . no one gives the blob creature enough credit , though it must have had supernatural powers you see was so slow-moving that a snail or an earthworm could made quick get-a-way but human victims froze in their tracks...too paralyzed with fear to even inch backwards and thus met fate...alien aspic..
nice pace , great storyline and direction . a classic !
so cool
this is one of the scariest movies i have ever seen and don't even like horror . if you are looking for a scary movie halloween
ok , so it is a little bit cheesy but well told story and has quite few surprizes ! the concept different some of scenes are disturbing . i have never seen movie like resides in my top 25 movies all time
an excellent well-done thriller in which space vampires infest london . mathilda may did job as the pretty but sinister girl and zombies bats were scary
great fun . it is a spectacular way to kill an hour and half watching kane hodder in his final role date as jason hack slash bunch of teens adults alike space again , entertaining ; but definately not worthy oscar
i really need to get this dvd . the professional has distinction of being a sad action movie
dudes this is the greatest movie ever and i luv jason hope he kills everybody in next muvie an am so glad killed freddy cuz sux go
one of the greatest movies ever ! they should make a sequel it was sad seeing leon die at end , but happy watching stansfield get what he deserved .
even when i see natalie portman in films such as star wars ii , still think of her an execeptionally sweet little girl 'leon' . directed by luc besson starring the above jean reno gary oldman this is a story mathilda who orphaned twisted cop kills his family because some missing cocaine that father was taking care taken leon and beautiful relationship between two characters grow hitman extremely childlike simple he without thinking but takes great looking after pot plant wants to become 'cleaner' like so she can revenge brothers death - ends up trouble herself saves won't ruin it for you telling exactly what happens you'll have watch yourself film quite timeless
its only a movie and damn good one too
exploding....heads....are....funny
an interesting mix of sci-fi and horror . normally i would bash it because in truth is more than , but just loved the movie out control scientists mutant telepaths telekinetics very cool yes as two reviews below mention... gore ! exploding heads for young idiotic who believe that what should be
pretty ok .
i love this movie thinks its the best werewolf ever made plot was awsome very few flaws lots of blood and gore highly recomend it
maybe everybody's wondered at one time or another about that coincidence of the two 28 day cycles.. . being moon (roughly) and other being.. well , when ginger says i got curse you figure it out this was a concept nobody ever seemed to have explored in film because they were afraid couldn't be handled tastefully enough maintain audience interest all know is loved movie sharp dark well-paced painfully real had great fx never lost momentum amusingly uses horror handle normal phenomenon just blowing proportion as werewolfism rising animal influence adult life causes us leave childhood innocence sometimes friends siblings temporarily behind thing like 'raiders ark' can deadly serious cinematic entertainment strongly recommend cast producers writers did an excellent job
very creepy and disturbing .
jason is tha man an he kicks but in this very great muvie i luv it will buy the first day go
great movie it ruled rocked rent
katie holmes is hot
yes...the tooth fairy is a killer !
please , for a minute forget the fact that villain is tooth fairy . when you watch how directors portrayed this vile snatch of beast it amazing first five-ten minutes exhibited opitamy setting dark mood.moving from bloody mouth due to freshly yanked slow musicless scene youthful sympathy and straight howling child eating whore in black screaming banging on surrounding walls wraith was always shrouded darkness expelled hideous shreiks moans never know where she could be hiding i've noticed easy main character evade wench but think about he's been running her 30-something years fool's gotta good at ! i gave movie 5 stars because rest not-knowing-a-damn-thing-about-horror-flicks-even-if-you-were-gang-raped-by-freddy-jason-3 zombies-and shabby rep oh yeah...the acting really sucked uh...so did ending
i liked it...so thats why gave it the score did
this movie kept me on the edge of my seat , and it wasnt because there was something nasty . very suspenseful guessing until end great for a cold rainy night with friends
i just saw this movie last night with a huge group of friends , and think if all them hadn't been there would have had nervous breakdown . is terrifying from start to finish it's message don't peek instruction stay in the light normally get very freaked out at movies but one made me want close my eyes catch breath an excellent that makes you afraid sleep your off ending little weak compared rest film overall wonderfully scary plays on emotions psychological well-being !
one of my favs . never get sick it i love allison's character and her brother was sooo cute.a good sequel
i loved it
james woods stars in this movie about a group of vampire killers sent out by the catholic church.this features great action scenes and wonderful performance thomas ian griffith as head vampire.this is one best non-dracula movies ever made.if you're looking for good scary check !
this movie is great . it vulgar and offensive but it's just a ! i would probly have to say that the funniest ever seen
i dont know about anybody else , but if you see this movie in the theatres it will haunt . does a good job to get into your mind images were very eerie and hard forget ghost was simply creepy also have some scenes that make jump unpredictable especially ending one of most serious endings i've ever witnessed !
by far the sickest and most twisted featurw film ever made . no act of nastiness is untouched in this horrifyingly revolting hilarious shock a minute horror comedy from troma terror firmer takes place during filming toxic avenger 4 there sadistic psycho killer stalking set killing those who are demoralizing family values bong stabbings , exploding breasts escalator mutilation,double leg amputation with semis naked fat men frightningly tiny penises running street even mangina impalments(you'll know what i'm talking about when you see climax,yikes!) ! one disgusting yet brilliant films long live troma!!! highly recommended!!! not for faint heart
overdone , over-acted but what fun! ! will you do without freedom ? terrific action sequences .  .although where is the bridge in battle of stirling bridge? oh well i don't want to be a spoil-sport and point out few mistakes movie
i really couldn't think of a better way to close this trilogy . most the questions introduced in film were answered end , and honestly was shocked with ending revealing roman as mastermind behind events entire quite clever also very impressed writing erin kruger who did great job closing although his style seems conflict that kevin williamson parker posey hilarious jennifer one part not like which bit far fetched lame appearance by randy simply put appease character's fan club overall good movie
scream 3 was a good ending to the trilogy . it answered all my questions i had about other movies plus , kept me at edge waiting which did great movie and loved
the last scream is best of trilogy . this movie keeps you in suspense throughout entire show never know who killer until very end , and even then can't believe a person could do something like that
it was a great movie that i felt welcome back hitchcock  . if h tchcock alive he probably would give the same rating to this film strongly recommend all psychologic-stress lovers also pfeiffer is again excellent both with her beauty and act which gives horror scenes double or triple effect should be seen !
it leaves you with a sense of conclusion and gives twist to what thought the ending would be .
a five rating only because i saw it when was just kid . that scene where the two girls are walking home from school and up ahead on sidewalk man in black with mask steps out behind bush looks at them then back to have disappeared reach freaked me hard
despite the sometimes slow-moving pace of film , i really thought that this was one hell a thriller . it not scary just very suspenseful and thrilling musical score perfect for made all more yes some parts in middle dragged on but end well worth wait became predictable last 45 minutes never expected quite ending provided have watched scene recent times like love when pfeiffer's character discovers her husband (ford) cheating with student fine acting jobs by both michelle pfeiffer harrison ford espescially who truly showed his range as an actor playing vey different role than good guy roles he is accustomed to darkness through facial expressions words at movie- turned stone cold : no emotion had suspense great plot eerie feeling reminded me so much psycho  i'd reccomend anyone looking even remotely resembles work hitchcock
love it !
i personally thought that the movie was really good . it so intense can't see how a based on such great book by stephen king could be bad acting very decent and one of things made is fact scary , funny dramatic all at same time special effects were didn't seem like multiplication (unlike matrix reloaded) overall think dreamcatcher totally worth seeing (in spite what callmetootie might say)
despite other opinions here , i think the movie was great . haven't read book yet but plan to now saw it with friends while a bit gory after all is stephen king film much better than expected tom sizemore big draw get me through doors of show not disappointed
tom sizemore is always supurb!!!! !
this movie was actually pretty funny , seeing as it had many aspects to : romance gore comedy drama . a good if you don't mind few profanitie and sex scenes here there
i love barbra hershey . in this movie , you have to feel for her charactor the is based on a true story which means they took police report witness statements plantiff testimony etc. and blew it out of proportion make did outstanding at truly scary times.... think about how would be raped by ghost no way prove it??? ?
magnificent acting by michelle and harrison . quite an unusual thriller
very silly
this film can be really good campy eighties fun on a rainiy day or even regular . it's all about how you watch picture
i have seen a lot of horror movies and think that this was one the best . admit movie relied on special effects but great part about it also like with story line to anybody who really paid attention not just how many there were realized had , can you deny actors actresses they what made all around
this movie totally freaked me out but it was so cool ! great story!they should make more movies like this!but i don't understand what the whole deal with bath tub is about
full moon put out many horror flicks during the 80's and 90's under guidance of charles band , a very talented man . subspecies was one great series movies produced his run initial film in at times less than stellar but with major recast,( denice duff stepping into lead roll michelle) sequals were almost perfect radu would have to be all time greatest movie villains
one of the best horror flicks i've seen.rob zombie did an excellent job directing this.the cinematography is ingenious.i do not recommend this for kids or squeamish.the acting top-notch and casting perfect.karen black returns to screen as mother a brood psychopaths.cherri moon both sexy scary-talk about "femme fatelle" ! yipes towards end it gets very strange almost surreal .
anyone who didnt love this movie probably just peed in their pants while watching it and are so embarassed they felt had to come here give a bad score . dont liek horror movies ? go watch some more bambi like one !
the first and by far best of trilogy . holds up well on tv 4th 5th time around
one of my favorite movies all time . well written , acted and the special effects were very good for
freakfest . i loved every minute of it
dude , this movie was great rob zombie did really well making fun of classic horror movies i love the camera angles and how all deaths are brutal painful you guys that said it sucked obviously have no taste .
money
best friday the 13th movie . jason dies and still manages to frighten audience this is a good conclusion series
i liked it !
one of the best horror films recent years , a real groundbreaker . hype may have killed it but now that dust has settled we can watch and enjoy again like this works on imagination 1990s
one of the best horror movies i've ever seen . it had me on edge my seat
this is the most sick , disturbing and twisted movie i've ever seen in my life :d oh geez.. . i get nauseous just thinking about it! ! thats why give it a 5
im sorry , but imo this movie was absolutly scary as hell . i honestly scared for days lol
this movie is awesome ! it scares me as hell .
okay , this is a definite love it or hate movie . there seems to be no grey area when asking people about me ? i loved was the scariest have ever seen perhaps because didn't question just let myself taken on ride ending packs punch few other movies can come close delivering plus you can't argue with fact that biggest moneymaker (percentage-wise) in history cost : 100 grand made million lot of rich.. one first dvd's bought for my player after got i've five times (the director's commentary great!) and scary parts still make skin crawl great but go
this is truly an excellent movie . not to spooky , but the possibility of something like witch kind frightening a good watch enjoy !
there isn't much i can say that hasn't already been said about this film . wasn't very scared by it but did creep me out was such a great change to see movie didn't follow the same old formula have brandy or neve in something new brought cultural shock wave myself am an actor and found improve exorcise really liked respect movie.highly recommend for those into original odd films
i like it . this is different
this movie kept me on edge from beginning to end . it was scary and i like movies there weren't too many twists very entertaining
brilliant movie . scariest i have ever seen thought it was real loved the story very realistic gave me chills great idea for a
that movie was scary . it a new style of something they were good actors who knew how to act made the seem real
a terrifying movie that uses the unseen rather than seen to frighten moviegoers . full of suspense and terror , this is one best in long time i am really looking forward sequel hope it can compare first
who knew that mel gibson could write and direct . truly a riveting , inspirational powerful movie that'll be classic !
this is a thrilling movie that has great plot . unlike some other thrillers , there actually good story the ending will surprise everyone
i appreciated the uniqueness in which this movie was made with bare minimum of funds . they used their very weakness as financially poor producers to reveal an authentic manner capturing a mystery that plagues psyche one small town day
it was very scary . action filled and suspenseful michelle pfieffer is hot harrison ford a talented actor , i enjoy his films
this was definitely a great movie . the reason being that it is very realistic makes you wonder about things can happen when in woods i am tired of stupid , fake monster movies !
this movie was wonderful . it full of suspense the story flowing and never dragged on usually during most scary movies i've seen , they weren't as i thought would be actually fulfilled my expectations a it's favorite now
the scariest movie of all time! ! you won't feel scared when watch . creepiness starts to crawl into your mind start talking and thinking abt it after is over close reality , can happen any us yaiks!
talk about creative , it's like the old late afternoon/dark games of hide and seek we used to play . not what happens but could,....
the freakiest , most psychologically disturbing movie ever !
one of the best horror movies i have ever seen makes you think .
blair witch project was a cool movie . when i left the theatre , afraid to be alone would like know who hit everyone over head
the blair witch project is a horror movie that requires an imagination .
i was screaming throughout the entire movie . didn't suspect harrison ford to be murderer michelle played a really beautiful role
depalma's best...remember the shower scene with angie dickenson ?
i watched that and it is so scary!!!! !
this one was better than the first cuz that buffy blonde really got on my nerves
scary and cool !
it was cool , really scary and suspensfull also sad . did ever say why he killed his kids ? took place a little too close to home though wayne county new york just one east of monroe county!! !
the movie is about a husband who had an affair without his wife knowing and then killed girl . has good plot that both scary exciting
i was hesitant about seeing this movie when it premiered...i finally worked up enough nerve to view . i'm glad that did stellan skarsgard excellent as father marron (??spelling??) ! watching gave me a lot of answers the why pazuzu's existence in first place
excellent horror comedy .
are you alone in the house freddy???? ?
good thriller movie with lots of unexpected twists . harrison ford is ending kind creeps you out
omg ! i went to the movies see this movie . thougt it was so scary seriously like scared look in my bathroom mirror for a whole 2 weeks.i think michelle , whatever her last name is did great job...i soooo shoked at end whoa
a cult classic but you have to see it at least once if just realize how warped some peoples minds are out there and knowing they created this .
patriotic movie that touched my heart
loved it !
it was a great movie that i felt welcome back hitchcock  . if h tchcock alive he probably would give the same rating to this film strongly recommend all psychologic-stress lovers also pfeiffer is again excellent both with her beauty and act which gives horror scenes double or triple effect should be seen !
freddy is the best horror movie character alive
best in the series . great scene with party and pool freddy posseses nerd rocks house kid this looks like from christine totally surreal scenes done miniatures
troma ! it's about time a movie made it on the list toxie is great long live
not the best troma movies , but definately one of better ones . this movie is really funny and it had a lot far out original stuff that only sick genius mind lloyd kauffman could dream up as for acting effects go  well its must see classic i mean how can you say have lived if havent seen toxic avenger ?
my favorite movie ever!! ! i love it! it's sooo funny .
written , directed and staring roman polanski this nightmare will find the paranoia in any viewer
it was a real good movie but the frist one still better
excellent thriller . must see ! not original at all it is one scare movie that will the viewer
alright , this movie was awesome . unfortunately so many people are not gonna get it hardly anyone will watch you have to truly the with an open mind and pay attention make sense acting good story well thought out unusual definitely a unique witchcraft if looking for late at night is
sraight up the most awesome display of movie making in horror genre . a tight script , excellent direction and pretty talented no-name cast only person it i know by name is kelly preston she plays damsel distress that gets undressed well take heed ! pay attention entire or will pass you be prepared for ending... shock
rarely does a movie hold enough suspense to draw scream from my throat , this was an exception...and mine not the only one heard . script full of incredible plot twists haunting images and total surprise ending had me hitchcocish camera angles overall cinematography resurrected horrors psycho other such films i totally enjoyed change typical roles normally played by both harrison ford michelle pfiefer
this movie was so cool . i seriously jumping out of my seat the whole time , although it did take a long for everything to add up
first of all vampires themselves are illogical , and i was more watching to see gerard butler then if it logical or not . a very good movie ! and- he wasen't in the sunlight when bit that news lady clearly said sun behind clouds
this is one of those movies you can see over and again still have the living daylights scared out . not only that don't know what going to happen end a real shocker it really surprises i love movie saw twice already want for third time
this movie was really good because it scary and the visual effects were awesome . also , had a decent story
this was a dark and haunting movie . ben kingsley superb !
scary!!!!!'''''
child's play 3 was a real horror . it had me on the edge of my seat always thinking who is going to die next good movie one best
this movie was extra raw . chucky a fool and he had wife too i like how they got themselves in out of situations my favorite part when the baby , so know that there will be sequel
very exciting and nasty ! do not like dolls , so the killing doll made it even more scary . to see good plot
wow ! what an entertaining movie . i simply don't understand the people who like this , but i'll bet to a person they voted for clinton it is roughly accurate historical portrayal of oppressive english colonialism and heroic efforts that were undertaken by oppressed (scots) violence was graphic certainly in line with reality time gibson did great job on both sides camera good mix comedy (irish character stephen) romance can those say isn't their cup tea anyone calls bad has other motives
i gave this movie a 5 because always liked harrison ford and the plot of whole was really good .
when you go to this movie expect a simple ghost in the background . but it had more twists and turns than any other that i have seen are afraid blink because something else might happen will be lost for rest of end shock
i give this movie a 5 because to me think is one of the most scariest movies that i've seen . it was very dramatic and has best storyline , makes you what's going happen next then jumps right at
one of my favorite comedies . debbie reynolds and albert brookes really did a great job with this funny script the lines are humorous reminded me own family i highly recommend renting
awesome ! you never knew what was going to happen next . i on the edge of my seat whole time liked way it scary , but not bloody and gross
this one was a classic .
this is one of the best suspense thrillers all time . i felt uncomfortable from opening scene
grossed me out and scared the crap of .
masturbate
zombies that actually moved ! creative , great shots of the game very unique and original .
this movie alsolutely rules ! awesome music , emotion battle scenes etc . it's also loosely based on history there is a 300-foot statue of william wallece in scotland i'm not big mel gibson fan but he does great job
this movie had my skin crawling . i hadn't been scared like that in a long time friend's sister was crying because it so disturbing thought the music added to suspense nicely
i think it's so good as the first one . but when you gonna watch book of shadows forget style movie , they are totally different course mythology about blair witch stills same enjoy it ! and wait for 3
the original blair witch was a cultural phenomina . even if you never saw it heard about i think alot of people chose to dislike because everyone else loved so in turn found hip hate , many contiously book shadows before ever giveing this great film chance very brave move for joe berlinger ( director paradise lost 2 revelations and brother's keeper) take reins direct had already chosen kill with criticism cool different approach making veteran documintarian decided documentary styled project sequel shoot completly also smart beed done using same formula technique wouldn't have been as fresh or inventive not only that but spoofs come out i'm sure he didn't want any confusion clever characters woods put them loft acting well directing my opinion is flawless could ask more complex thought provoking story score really bring life movie differs from just seen no show up (except un named evil be collective dellusion.) directly comments on success questions existince main star series...the asks question are five teens latest victims exists black hills possible does exist at all ? were youngins who obssesed their own way driven into killing spree caused by mass hysteria created media frenzy surrounding human supernatural comes within these kids don't remember what they did history makes lets me sit through viewing without getting goosebumps cold chills haven't yet do an open mind hated try sitting again techniqe mentioned creative ways horror films days purely fact there straight here let spell answers might confused will leave thinking ...and stunned genuinly good mystery jeff donovan man !
this movies was amazing . sorry kids , but is no teenie bopper horror flick with jenifer love hewitt accually a thought provoking movie the blair witch realy behind murders or tour group just in mass hysteria ? that question brought up here i think tackles issue of dangers believing blurring lines between fiction and reality had great ensamble cast young actors who hadn't been revealed yet very well directed although watched commentary by joe berlinger wish studio messed it even through an unbelievable creepy as hell too not while your watching when you go home start thinking all freaky stuff manifested itself throughout really admire for tackling sequel at completely different angle than original only did bad because people wanted to recomend those have seen see hated give another chance my perspective
it was an excellent movie!!!! ! i loved it!!!!
i really enjoyed watching cheerleader massacre . thought that it was a great movie it's throwback to the old slasher horror movies of 1980s , except came out in 2003 liked story and performances from actors actresses guess there is going be sequel can't wait see !
i havent seen this since was a kid , but at that time it the scariest thing ever saw .
fantastic,classy,edge of your seat thriller.one the greatest suspense films i have ever seen.ther are lots unexpected plot twists.it is a rare treat to see two great actors in horror film this caliber.it made me scream like little girl several times.excellent movie!!! !
outstanding . does a great job of explaining what training cycle at red flag is like , with an emphasis on aerial photography and any time you can see in the imax format know you're for treat
the great barrier reef is most beautiful in world .
the first imax movie i ever saw . a great film swear , got soaked during rafting scenes!!!! !
i believe saw this movie in capital reef area utah . though thought it was a on the national park , video taken from helicopter as flew over cliffs made
it's amazing what they do with helicopter shots . a great experience for those people not fortunate to go see it in person the color quality of movie kinda' sucks you into whole was fun as well
i loved seeing this movie . the scenery was beautiful and it amazing to learn about all different creatures that live in remote part of world !
there have been videocassettes made about everest journeys , but you to be in the theatre see huge screen and living giant color dangers these people undertook sometimes lost their lives . touching moving great show
it was especially good because i got to see this film with a lecture beforehand by the director his own personal slides and antecdotes . neat movie
what a story !
great movie . keeps you scared never would've suspected harrison ford as the bad guy- edge of your seat scares loved it !
everest was the first imax i ever saw and awestruck . making of it production real life drama spellbinding is a wonderful new way to present media
this is a spectacular film about the disastrous climb up mount everest that also subject of book into thin air . seeing in imax theater adds so much to experience (i rented , but it just not nearly as good on normal television.) i saw after reading and (the latter same expedition written by member one other groups mountain) was an excellent supplement books particularly eerie watching climbers traverse seemingly bottomless chasms only using ladders tied together rope wonderful definitely worth theaters
sharks are jawsome! !
since this is about sharks , you know i'm going to be lovin' it !
island of the sharks is my most favorite imax movie ever !
a wonderful treat for viewers who appreciate the arts...colorful costumes , well-choreographed dances beautiful cinematography . my favorite was "love" blooming and depicted on lilly pad with "statues" amazing display of sheer strength power balance
great 3-d movie filled with symbolism and intrigue not normally found in an imax film . wonderful experience
beautiful ! i was clutching the armrests whole time
this film is what an imax movie was meant to be . fantastic use of the format--astonishing visual treats
i have seen a bunch of imax movies and it's always great sight , but this movie really brought out what california is all about . also it brings how californians are innovative unique super shots spectacular sights with extreme people doing things in these eye candy
this is a really good movie . you don't know what going to happen might be able predict few parts but others completely blow away i would of never thought the ending way it was
i have always been a fan of this movie!..ever since was small..it seem to shut me up!!..and seein it at imax cool! !
this is a great movie . one better than the first update of fantasia i found lot segments interesting like carnival animals there was only returning segment
fantasia has always been one of disney's best movies . the 2000 version brought it to life sound quality was much better animation seems clearer and newly added scenes story kept your eyes glued screen kinda' like a where's waldo book
good thriller movie . i was on the edge of my seat whole screamed , yelled wept cried bit tongue so many times even though you know what coming again couldnt sleep by myself that night had funny parts too
disney did it again . anyone who liked the first fantasia will love second is an excellent mix of old and new some great jazz added in you really get into storylines with music feel for whales wish could fly them want to hug little girl tie up her terrible mother my personal favorite- flamingos i have say , many people agreed me on this point it's all about !
i really enjoyed the movie . found animation very imaginative like sava , also firebird suite selection most effecting and left theatre misty-eyed that was a moving spiritual ending ! it would be great to see what they could do with last ten minutes of mahler's symphony no.8 for next fantasia symbolizing movements planets stars goes from soft choral sounds symphonic triumph
an amazing movie . there wasn't a single part i didn't enjoy the firebird suite was best great date
for music and animation lovers , this is your movie ! each animated story was different interesting matched perfectly with beautiful classical . watch it at the imax dome theatre you will see what i mean
i thought that disney did a wonderful job in updating this movie . the animation was fantastic and music they chose perfect it great for all ages
this is one of the best imax ovies i've seen . music was spectacular and animation very original
this was great in everyway imax! !
....not only was this movie great in terms of content and cinematography , the music awesome ! since i viewed las vegas have made every effort to locate soundtrack but not been successful . if someone reads knows a source where can get please let me know don't miss imax
it was a good way to see how the greatest basketball player came about . movie had biography and great pictures i loved what go along with such
michael jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time . seeing him on huge screen working his magic incredible in my personal opinion he best this sport and no one else can even come close to
michael jordan's high flying moves were captivated very well in this imax film . they used a 70mm camera and the air he glides on is beautiful
harrison ford as a villian ? i've got to see this again . from the very first scene , i was sucked in would it but i'm afraid i'll pee my pants it's so scary
this was an incredible film . i-max in general produces many of the best releases is a perfect movie for any jordan fanatic as well sports fans camera angles provide great format to view michael jordans unimitatable moves
i saw it and loved it!may update this later .
mission to mir was another good imax movie . they showed the things you don't really get see from nasa on news stunning space stars were great
this movie made my mother feel motion sickness ! it was awesome , as the space shuttle journeyed through stars seemed to pass right by us . felt like we were moving especially when in station and turned about cameras but most thing looking at earth from just so huge that closest i would ever get seeing whole world point of view breathtaking plus music is played or not ; even silence a powerful impression
still my favorite imax movie , after all these years . no 3d glasses special effects--a simple about the joys of air travel it was first so holds a place in heart
the original , a classic ! i remember first time saw to fly as kid at national air and space museum in washington d.c . walking into theater seeing that awesomely huge screen literally holding onto my seat eyes were flooded with scenes of world seen from above feeling like was flying birds will never forget how felt
the first imax i ever saw and was just completely mesmerized by experience . wonder why all movies aren't made this way scenery amazing- we only learned about antarctica in books , briefly able to 1st hand what it really looked like changed my view movie showed us penguins that hopped around their natural habitat instead of a zoo got see polar bears playing with fish truly picturesque gives you much better sense icy continent
photography and sound made me feel like i was right in the middle of action . could heat those flames content script so interesting (how teams developed ways to combat fires) interviews with workers fight even more real
this was about burning oil refineries in kuwait/iraq , where there were hundreds of these fires . i saw it a cold theater when watched and got hotter during the movie right front me you could see oxygen burst tendrils flames heat burn off never knew that different from ones here area they had completely machines now what film also showed all damage been done to countryside felt hatred towards people who caused unecessarily
the stones are awesome . they had hits like paint it black , under my thumb ruby tuesday and satisfaction !!!!!long live stones!!!!!1
incredible , but am trying to find out if it is available buy
wow , this was one incredible imax experience . it had been awhile since i seen a 3d movie and hadn't realized how far come felt like in the plus love computer animation cyberworld gave me plenty of that ! is basically bunch short sequences linked together by small plot there were some cheesy points aimed toward kids but cute whole complete eye candy simpsons (homer^3 from halloween special) my only complaint wasn't longer because could have watched stuff for hours
great movie ! i felt like they were right next to me . it has an amazing cast including jenna elfman , dave foley all of the simpsons woody allen and sharon stone
i really liked this movie . it was good to see all the extreme sports on a three story tall screen snowboarding , and surfing part is just as
the best imax film i've seen ! especially i liked wind surfing/board sailing scenes :-d
great movie to put on imax . really felt as though you were right there i'd improve the color a little bit
the special effects were really good . we got pretty dizzy
this might sound crazy , but is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time . the opening scene where earth comes up from bottom to fill entire screen.. one see sitting in front row you'll feel like your space walking
this is like candy for the eyes . they (sony) have created such amazingly innovative products , but blows them all away i love watching imax movies it makes me want to go buy an theater
loved every second of it and i am a 38 year old female . watched many people from 5 to 70 get back in line see again
the movie takes you right into heart of teams....lots driver and team member perspectives as well . excellent racing footage , good background information both old new nascar fans will enjoy learn something from this
it was a good movie .
the great classics don't get old . i did watch this when was young and not ignore any of parts only like title music , but also "gotta dance" "make 'em laugh" & "good morning to you." debbie reynolds one best voice overs for a beautiful squeaky woman in movie that actores wanted produce love nothing can duplicate mgm masterpice now
this movie is one of my very favorites ! the about silent screeen era that on brink going to talkies.it well acted , has some terrific dance numbers . it funny in parts.actors trying adapt a microphone jean hagens voice wonderful hard believe debbie reynolds had never danced before she did good job her role i always enjoy watching gene kelly and donald o'connor was great as have lost count how many times seen
classic , . gene kelly was just wonderful in this movie something about him is so charasmatic and really draws you into the story of perhaps best scene tapping singing down street rain it's one those scenes never forget always makes smile all dancing great donald o'connor hilarious as usual chemistry between reynolds real not forced which made their performances that much better but musical actually had a plot substantial from can imagine
one of those movies that hollywood just can't ever make again . attempting it would be a waste and might damage the aura solid classic
the best thing about this movie is jean hagen ! she did a great acting job of not being able to act and , for all you trivia buffs in scene where debbie dubs jean's voice...it actually real voice hear . so ultimately it was dubbing one all-around movies ever made brilliant writing top notch
classic . one of the best movies ever made yes dance are great , storyline is genius gene kelly and debbie reynolds wonderful but it's jean hagen who makes this movie
this is by far the best musical i have ever seen . gene kelly did a wonderful job and his singing/dancing skills were top notch ! donald o'connor was halarious at many points in film...and would to say love scene of don kathy kathy's car when they first meet you're finished watching film , you feel like going down streets imitating gene's 'singin' rain' definetely recommend movie people all ages
by far the best movie ever made ! it's definitely my favorite . i had honor of seeing it in an old , preserved theater milwaukee wi and was a very emotional experience love donald o'connor's energy debbie reynolds's spunk who doesn't adore gene kelly's romp through rain while he's singing title track ?
this is one of the great feel good movies all time . gene kelly's dance number , singing and dancing in rain a classic his best morning sequence with kelly donald o'connor debbie reynolds contagious -- after i've watched movie that song sticks my mind for days !
spectacular movie . at first i was extremely biased against it as musical very unmanly watched more ofteni began to enjoy the way all slides together so nicely and sheer comedy good acting involved are stupendous a must see for
this was the best movie i have ever seen in my life...it's a murder mystery with great ending twist ! it's probably first scary i've without nudity or language! perfect for all ages
tremendous ! this all tapping , ballet and jazz film is great a must-see for dance lovers . gene kelly iam proud to say the greatest dancer in entire world cute one too singer at that also starring debbie reynolds (mother of princess leia or more appropriately carrie fischer) beautiful amazing considering she did not until movie (gene taught her movie) it's fun-loving tap crazy with romance humour (especially from cosmo ) go c now
this is my all time favourite movie ever . and i haven't seen anything yet to contradict statement every little thing about it makes special you'll remember the first you watched for
this is the quintessential movie musical . totally happy , wonderful it has some of best dancing you'll ever see thanks to gene kelly and donald o'connor singin' in rain ultimate feel-good films
it has hollywood's most euphoric moment ! and some mighty fine tap dancing
this is one of those great movies that i continue to watch over and again . the entire movie phenomenal , music acting dancing are incredible !
great movie . gene kelly is one of the greatest dancers all time
i love this movie ! it is such a sweet and its so cute .
a one of kind trip through man's life song and dance medical procedure . roy schieder was never better bob fosse's legacy is well served by this naked examination his character art
so who was this bob fosse ? he selfish , cynical and remarkably sensitive -- another artist could get away with being hateful because of his ability to see create beauty awareness . but then american critics too a hell lot these days they dump their opinions on the page forget clean them up i havent read one critique yet that pointed out film is postmodern ! all jazz post-modern perfect medium for : its skeptical unreligious unaccountable playful fosses outer life apparently same way inner more complicated than deeper given us in pieces lets you experience without actually spelling it (he spells great deal hard words about himself many things are only hinted at) again what seem miss so-called flaws might be necessary add complexity contradictory nature theres womanizer addict workaholic supposed tongue-in-cheek tedious parts riveting/haunting others thats hes describing no would have intended hollywood wanted an artistic subtle uneven light funny little silly deeply disturbing formula art most accurately reflects real according several self-indulgent annoying long product something gratification look at screen looking unless course does thrills delights makes cry just right moments used commercials usually thrilling sentimental majority online reviews think gracious magnanimous granting unique moving some leave choreography intriguing performances impressive attempt due not lack intelligence reviewers interest subject matter
a virtually underrated film . perhaps it wasn't well recieved in it's day because of dark tone that is not often associated with musicals but roy schieder amazing and jessica lange haunting schieder's main supporting characters , leland smith anne reinking literally steal the show two faboulous dancers are just outstanding from dance number to final number......gosh sequence still gives me chills makes teary eyed everytime
the direction is a bit disjointed . partly due to method in which movie told scheider fantastic great music and type of story you just don't see very often
an excellent movie- even if it is a musical
i did this one (off broadway) so am partial . love the music and dancing  would have voted my favorite musical until moulin rouge came along natalie wood a wonderful acting part but why couldn't they get real singer/actress to do lead role instead of obvious dubbing ms wood's voice
great movie , in its time and place . nat wood was a really good actress she the best anyone could at that given role today we would have used singers accurate types (i.e puerto ricans etc.) ...but for then it still entertaining to view
everything about this film is great except the leads . interesting retelling of romeo and juliet in 1950s urban setting with racial overtones tremendous , memorable musical score (thank you lenny bernstein) outstanding choreography (j robbins was a genius) very decent acting for (especially ned glass john astin simon oakland small supporting roles) fine art direction russ tamblyn (riff) underrated song dance type however natalie wood totally miscast as maria : it's hard to suspend disbelief when california girl russian descent tries come off puerto rican gal from bronx also marnie nixon's voice dubbed natalie's singing parts which pretty lame stature (nixon ghost-sang that notable no-talent audrey hepburn my fair lady) richard breymer tony wooden ridiculous they tried make star guy late 50s early 60s but failed no wonder he's talentless only fault picture producers made once again cardinal error hollywood musicals i.e. putting non-singers lead roles sake box office appeal doesn't work here any other case attributes compensate rare indeed
such a sweet movie with good message .
this movie almost made me piss my pants . more than once but seriously , what lies beneath could be the scariest i've ever seen when pfeiffer turned into decomposed girl in bathtub as ford was grabbing for her necklace ! holy mother make it stop.. definitely worth seeing theater
a great adaptation of romeo and juliet with some southside bronx flavor . natalie wood shines in this movie if you like hopeless romantic , timeless feature is for it holds up very well time
i love the storyline .
this movie was awsume ! is everything : funny,sad,tense,action and mich more it a true classic you will luv if have not already seen
i like this musical a lot it is really good recomend to anyone who likes musicals
this one is a classic for good reason . the choreography , music and acting are all excellent it's easy to put yourself in musical
what a great date movie . it has all , action subterfuge romance it's so money i don't think have ever had bad when we watched this
the music in this was wonderful , evoking appropriate moods for each scene . setting is a great adaptation of shakespeare's romeo and juliet
new york gangs , they sing fight fall in love . true classic deals with race relations as a whole gang fights puerto rican but despite all the fighting it's romantic story
the best musical ever made (movie-wise) ! modern romeo and juliet , two that were forbidden to love did . their brought together communities hated each other taught message of tolerance compassion main key between romance maria tong said conquered all classic music moves story along makes movie entertaining a true piece art
very emotional and great story , this is not a movie for people short attention span if yours than too bad because you're missing out . well acted i give it an a+ !
west side story is a great musical . it has lot of good dances and songs i think the cast it's my favorite all time
i think that the music in this movie was awesome , which is probably why it's a musical . nonetheless rocked
i think this movie is a classic and an all around good .
i liked the musical of west side story because it had a very good plot & singing dance moves in this movie makes classic .
great music ! check out stan kenton's big band arrangements
theres only a few musicals i like and grease is one have always enjoyed
cute movie and i loved the music .
loved it . watch every time comes on i sing along its a make you feel good movie
this movie is a great classic of the 70's.it has love , lust music and drama..all ingredients to make 70's for all world pick up better! !
this is a great movie ! ladyshark and rock goddess go on bout there being no black or asian people in it . i don't knopw for sure but didn't 1950's californain high schools separate white kids , know that would explain
grease is just one of those movies i can watch over and again without ever getting bored . hearing songs brings a smile to my face happy-go-lucky true the feeling high school , this pure entertainment nothing deep or dramatic wildly talented it's meant be cheesy silly but most all fun
this is a great movie and will forever be an american classic .
one of my all time favorite movies !
absolutely loved this film and can watch it over again not get bored . the characters are all so fun , music is great ! a lot of memoriable scenes from (the grease lightning scene) if you haven't seen i highly reccomend do as classic
i love grease . john and olivia are great together , the soundtrack is too
i would say i've watched this start to finish at least 60 times . no kidding always wished could have went school with these guys they looked like were having so much fun the songs great , and chemistry between olivia newton-john john travolta was excellent in fact whole cast just about perfect
wow , what an amazing album ! so many great songs
i have to disagree with obsidian's assessment . yes , the story is a cliche but there are very few original plots ; most different ways of telling familiar movie has no depth -- don't think it ever intended be or seen as deep thought-provoking meaningful it's entertainment plain and simple for those us who like grease  succeeds well in entertaining ! i'm just glad never started counting number times i've
the tag line greatest musical of all time certainly isn't a lie . it's gotta be one best films that i've ever seen !
this movie is awesome . outstanding preformances by john travolta and olivia newton these incredibly funny but as a younger child i really hated it did not understand grease at all that was such waste the has very catchy tunes havent seen in about month yet still find myself humming them on occasion
a fantastic film . if you haven't seen it yet what are waiting for ? sureit's corny but the characters so much fun that it's hard to dislike great soundtrack , grease you're one i want summer nights all superb
i love grease  ! it's a really fun film the music is great and lines are memorable . all actors suited their parts were terrific john travolta olivia newton perfect as danny sandy
this movie is a great to get up and dance too
this is my absolute favorite movie of all times ! thie music awsume and the acting was best john travolta actor ever he sooo sexy in there so much singing dancing it increadible two thumbs up
grease is a great musical it one of my favorites . there really good acting in this movie and are songs when sandy comes to rydell high later finds out that danny the boy she fell i love with over summer goes gets excited but messes things up end everything turns all right though just don't think should have changed make happy
i'am proud to say that grease is the greastest musical ever made , and definatly considered be a classic today . danny sandy fell in love at beach but were split up when she had move back sydney with her parents schedule changes they end same high school together now part of pink ladies small little gallop girls smoke drink date t-birds ; mix between saturday night fever fonzie great soundtrack fact best one out there
grease is an all time favorite of mine its will still be a classic in 50 years there never another musical that ever have huge impact like did . as was once said you could watch tonight and entertained it 2 months from now
a classic , how can anyone not see grease in their lifetime . all the songs are catchy lines cheesy and characters loveable good movie for rainy day
catchy show tunes that are great to boogie at a dance . it has short cute plot about the dramas of love but in end , everything works out so all happy
i think music makes the movie . grease left everyone singing even my generation is fascinated with and 50's we all know lyrics to summerlove 
this movie/musical about highschool love in the 1950's is one of greats . songs that stay with you for life , like hopelessly devoted and your i want bring back intense feelings infatuation we all went through high school truly a wonderful film
grease is definitely a classic people of all ages can enjoy over and again . though the music be what thought to oldies , it hardly outdated also great movie that interpreted played live
grease is great ! i went to see it @ the re-release and loved just as much did first time saw . there something about soundtrack that screams summer!! love
how can you not be happy after this movie is over !
no other music movie of the last twenty-five years has had such an enduring impact . with my older sister playing record over and when i was a kid , learned lyrics to entire soundtrack can still sing along every song acting is strong singing excellent particularly considering that it actors who did if you get chance check out stage production grease do yourself favor so you'll recognize most songs but there will be couple which new
favorite moments : 1) danny to sandy (responding her what have you been up inquiry) know how it is , rockin and rollin whatnot . 2) the way marty eyes vic fontain at dance 3) john travolta pointing sky as he belts out a falsetto those summer ni-i-i-ights atop school bleachers 4) in crazy tight pants on shake shack movie!! !
grease is such a fun musical ! i don't know person who can watch bit of it and not be singing or humming the tunes along with sandy zuko rest pink ladies t birds . didn't set out to deeply moving emotional experience..it what was meant be..fun , goofy high school story full dramas teenage love some great dancing sappy songs
grease is the universal musical . it's silly , no one admits to watching it but everyone knows words
this movie was great because it's just fun to watch and young travolta looks .
i love grease . that is the best song ever for any occasion and every , rocks house
grease was a fun movie to watch . i loved the music and dancing in it
grease is an all time best movie for me .
this movie grease was the greatest musical i have ever seen
this is one of my favorite movies because since it has young people i can relate to a lot .
great music movie ! it includes everthing , adventure romance and some tragedy . this is a complete with fine songs that are unforgettable i do somtimes sing "so long farewell" when formal parting truly one true story lot of realism- couldn't tell if the background hills really backdrop austria or just made up best movies these actors participated in (esp for julie andrews should be best.)
classic film making . nothing offensive or violent catchy music , just feel good all the way if your into gritty reality this is not flick for you want to be entertained and have fun cream of crop i first saw it when was about 9 years old tole my mom going marry julie andrews grew up she didn't wait me though you're reading still love babe!! ! are one favorite things!!!
beautiful film . memorable songs and gorgeous scenery
a classic
fantastic scenery and vocals for the time . a beautiful movie back in day when clean (you know boring) happy endings (no heads flying off with viens dangling out...) were kinda miss those days sometime
i grew up with this movie and for a child sweet happy ending is just fine . as , still appreciate what taught me when the lord closes door somewhere he opens window true story made sweeter it gives viewer hope against our enemies
a thrilling picture from start to finish . keanu reeves put on stellar performance !
i grew up with the sound of music and think that it's one best musical movies ever made...it's a classic.. .
the greatest (no not exaggerated) musical ever ! (tied with mary poppins) anyone who says julie andrews is appealing just jealous of her fantastic talent . she best female vocalist to live and this movie proves it family film guarenteed delight entire from little ones elderly go out get you wont be sorry
this movie is a bona fide classic . at the same time , though it's guilty pleasure as 31-year old male nothing i go around spatting about that one of essentials but it plus those songs are catchy and stick in your head doe deer female ray drop golden.. see there again
some people call it corny or saccharine -- i disagree.remember that the movie was made almost 40 years ago , a time when wasn't crime for to have happy ending . story of nun sent be governess captain's children only end up marrying him and escaping from nazis sounds like plot too improbable critics but is true ! know although very much myself music not everyone's taste what ? all in it's my favourite certainly personal top ten
this movie was awsume ! the music very good and touching
this was a very well done movie i think that julia andrews played wonderful maria who the governess of vontrap family . kids always try to scare away each other governeses so they could spend more time with their dad but like have because she taught them how sing also where show running from austria get nazis'
one of the best musicals . a wonderful family movie.i love fact that this movie is based on real julie andrews terrific as maria ,we most songs.we have and cd about nun who sent to be governess seven children she teaches them sing takes outings course captain later fall in marry.and has find way get out austria away from nazis good we all enjoy
i love this film for so many reasons . the songs are classics and actors fantastic films like prove something to modern filmakers - you don't need sex violence make a good all is dorami
maybe it's because i grew up with it , but this musical is so whole some and naive (if you can call a movie that) . kind of puts me in an idyllic state like fairy tale
julie andrews is amazing ! her voice and charm carry this movie . i have 2 words , curtain clothes the soundtrack fun for whole family to sing
another of my mom's favorites . i really like julie andrews , too the story has also historical background-wwii-and it is interesting to see how all fits even inspired me find out a little more information about real von trapp family ladder
i really liked the active involment with children . songs were easy and fun to sing even when was younger sang along julia
freedom ! says it all . a reminder that there are things more important than life itself an epic film worth seeing again and
i loved all the songs in this movie . captain's children were sorts of ages , and it was easy to read understand their thoughts when compared your own experiences at that age scenery beautiful story great
i watched the sound of music innumerable times when was younger . songs are classic and scenes from movie puts viewers in a trance this is definitely family
the sound of music is a movie that tells story von trapp family . it so interesting because set in time wwii and nazi regime europe through beautiful events occur to maria , we see sadness their situation austria many people being forced fight war they did not agree with
as a 29 year-old (straight) male who owns his share of punk rock cds , i'm thoroughly embarrassed by my love for this movie . every once in while i'll get its songs stuck head especially that yodelling one they use during the puppet show but there's really not weak spot to whole (except song maria sings when she's on her way from convent von trapps)
this is the greatest music film ever made! ! my favorite since i was a kid .
this was one of the respectable musical that i have seen . it incorporated joy , sorrow freedom and love
the sound of music was exceptionally good especially because people all ages can watch it and appreciate its content .
one of the best movies starring ever wonderful keanu reeves . not only is he an outstanding actor in every way , but very good looking if anyone brought movie to a lower level it would have been sandra bullock even she did really job compared usual jam-packed with action and excitement from beginning end...i highly recommend it..
yul was one sexy bald man at that time ! debra k fantastic in this role . beautiful scenes - a good plot and well done for
this was my mom's favorite-she likes yule brenher and it about siam . i like the costumes , setting era music is great being asian immediately captured by culture don't recall any other muscials so even more special
i thought this movie really did a good job of portraying traditional king to move into more modern era . like the romance and humor in music
the king and i is great . it mixes classical pop music with an asian flare again , this movie leaves you singing duets between teacher leave entranced
one of my favorite musicals all time , and the film version was excellent . audrey hepburn did a wonderful job as eliza doolittle rex harrison henry higgins through
my fair lady . what a great movie well acted by all and done i wish they just would have let audrey hepburn sing her own songs the only down part of is can tell someone else singing for otherwise , terrific !
my fair lady is a wonderful musical ! it just filled with wit and charm . audrey hepburn was great for the role of eliza doolittle even though her voice dubbed rex harrison awesome as professor higgins too you can't really tell that audrey's anyway ending little annoying because seems being weak to return i think she loves him wants things be resolved between there nothing wrong always end up feeling they will get together after discuss more all different from pygmalion:)
i don't care if they did dub in another singer , audrey hepburn was the perfect choice and wonderful as liza . couldn't imagine anyone doing a better henry higgins than rex harrison either music is also great fun one of last big budget costume musicals best
i liked the plot of how a man tried to make poor woman into an elegant person . it proves that anyone can become anything they want , if you try romance didn't hurt either
i love audrey hepburn and old movies . accents if you like all that , it's a good movie the music is typical of musical stunning got sparks humor but end pisses me off weak female boo !
i really enjoyed my fair lady . audrey hepburn was definitely an asset to the movie her grace and elegance graced screen this is a that you can share with family or special someone
just to start this comment off , i'd like say that i absolutely love audrey hepburn . once again she had an amazing performance my fair lady is older film a blend of romance comedy and little bit drama it very long movie 2 movies in fact but goes really quick because it's such enjoyable give you understanding how much liked saw the 6th grade even felt way aobut then also
i loved this film
mgm's 1951 version is my favorite musical of all time . ava gardner great as the beautiful , drunken julie and howard keel kathryn grayson are in perfect voice gay magnolia add to that joe e brown cap'n andy william warfield singing ol' man river this show boat moving along mighty mississip with a stern-full wonderful melodies !
you know , when don't have the toilet paper throwing and screaming can actually hear lines discover that there's some very clever satire plays on old science fiction horror movies . sort of an early ms3000 type humor put into a film rather than beside it songs always ring through my head especially half naked susan sarandan singing "touchatouchatouchatouchatouch meee...." well image anyway
in case there's someone who doesn't know : this is an audience participation movie . one time i went and a couple 9th row or so apparently did not , because with rice water guns hot dogs flying they kept standing up protesting finally walked out can be lot of fun the right
its on in 3 minutes encore i have seen rocky horror at the midnight movie over and it really is a cult classic
classic!!!! !
very good movie , although i haven't really seen it in awhile had everything...suspense action drama and all that .
at least this movie didn't take itself too seriously.it was fun as a teenager to see it midnight few times.can't watching hunderds of times,though !
this is one movie you have to go . just watching the dvd isn't half as entertaining being in theater and experienceing audience participation i seen it well over 100 times , several at home but prefer experience
this movie was incredible!!..takes place as the best gay musical in world!!...thats what i think..loved it !
i love this movie!i think every one should own it.-rebekah ramos
fantastic . i'm a huge fan and i love every song in the movie
the first time went to see rhps was on my 14th b-day with mom and 17yr old brother. . damn it awsome ! i really didn't dress up , but wore eye shadow (thanks 24 year sister) didn'y know what say still had a great time. 2 every one who hasn't seen live suggest you go out it. u will love
a must-see-to-believe experience !
who knew a movie filmed inside bus would be so great ?
susan surandan is one of my favorite actresses and i love tim curry too . this movie great it has everything
this movie was inventive , bizzare and some how lovable the end a little weird but good ! i didn't expect musical .
dammit but i love this movie . classic stage-to screen flick starting the casted-to-perfection tim curry as dr frank n furter is absolutely fabulous being odd and eccentric it , may not be for everyone those with a taste dark comedy macabre will delight in story of two innocent young lovebirds (again inspired casting susan sarandon barry bostwick janet brad respectively) who on rainy night break down stumble upon castle out middle nowhere they go to use phone find themselves celebration aformention his unveiling rocky 'perfect' man that he created just gets weirder we doctor (sweet) transvestite bit temper all while cast sings variety songs such sweet  time warp etc would recommend cult highly one can watch enjoy know you shiver antici.....pation
hoppatootie bless my soul , i really love this real strange show ! one of the most wickedly hilarious movies have ever or will see . you can't explain its weird appeal to someone who doesn't humor and don't it anyone else now classic songs alone are worth price a cd in very odd way addictively memorable not mention great fun sing would venture say there has never been another character on stage screen quite like his insane strangeness bizarre dr frankenfurter though many imitations over years none managed do more exquisitely decadent drop dead funny interpretation than tim curry man is true offbeat acting genius also best entrances i've seen film thing about rocky experience should - first time need go through some kind indoctrination get into proper crazy frame mind appreciate if may soon be sitting with multiple question marks your head especially just rent video occurred by working around guy insanely own right former life as an art student had regular actors local saturday night screenings course he knew all wacky lines lyrics probably could done himself was mostly due office performances that ended up renting movie then buying sadly we work together any routines history well but every when moon full those memories cross sit rather maniacally chuckling myself such overwhelming urge wherever am warp again
i love it !
it's a great cult movie that everyone loves . they take the most odd ball sex story and sing dance should have see it in theater where people go all out dancing being characters
cult classic . the entire culture revolving , it is fascinating and enchanting tim curry a wonderful actor but live shows are also just as fun audience participation at its best....
this is a classic that you can watch 700 times . it has suberb soundtrack sexy actors wonderful story unique in itself
this is a must see when the auidence gets involved and participation high . some people act out movie while viewers yell at screen music catchy trust me , you will get lyrics stuck in your head
this is a classic cult film . you've got singing , sex and transvestites all star cast features tim curry susan surandon meatloaf of course to be accompanied with audience participation throw things yell have fun
i really enjoyed rocky horror picture show . it's definitely not for people who are very conservative it had everything from transexuals , homosexuals adultery and such this movie is a nice mixture of comedy music the songs totally off wall entertaining major no brainer that would recommend to anybody
from someone who has lost count on the times i've seen it and got to be as a performer (eddie riff) for 3 years.it is was great fun.always glad take virgin show.my kids know every song attending by age 8.the movie classic actors have gone there careers being found in this movie.elbow sex you all
sorry , but this is one of my favorite holiday movies and it contains christmas song white . nobody sang better than bing crosby
one of my holiday favorites ! the story is sweet and fitting for time period in which it set , characters are delightful funny songs magnificent . i watch this every christmas makes me appreciate both timeless immortality classic films
non-stop action . very suspenseful! !
i agree completely with leis -- one of the best ever music movies . is good , and story heartwarming christmas season just isn't same for me if don't manage to catch this movie ! actor who plays general can't remember his name wonderful scene at end reunion many men makes cry every time
i always have to watch this movie at christmas . rosemary clooney and bing crosby amazing voices harmonize beautifully they're able add some humor dancing the too
this holiday classic rocks ! who wouldn't agree that bing crosby is one of the best ever music movies . songs are great and timeless acting in film superb thing about white christmas it those all ages can enjoy
an all-star cast . most of whom could actually sing well a fun story that is told through the music where many just have during movie great should not be rated so low
my favourite musical , in fact one of the few i like . performed on stage its great and screen version captures much theatrical charm although casting is less than perfect opening number fugue for tinhorns best moments any movie
this movie is such fun ! i love sit down , you're rockin' the boat even liked frank sinatra in role and usually cannot stand to watch him on screen . miss adelaide a hoot
even though babsy is a political nitwit , she brilliant as fanny brice in this highly entertaining film .
babs is good all of the time . she a perfectionist and it shows always , delivers fabulous performance there are few like her i miss seeing
barbara streisand was great as fannie brice,the performer from the early to mid 1900s . there are some good songs such don't rain in my parade , and i'm greatest star roller skating scene is funny.other numbers well
robert preston and julie andrews are fantastic . from their singing to acting it was very well done the supporting cast did in most cases a wonderful story different what is offered of time currently an all-around fun movie that has many humorous moments even former football player good
julie andrews in her cross-drssing performance is delighfully funny and fresh . good score too !
i really didn't think would like this movie when first started watching it . just look that good but the more watched enjoyed , and was laughing out loud at some of comedy music's not bad either a pleasant surprise
a classy , fun movie with great musical numbers . julie andrews and robert preston give outstanding performances the set decoration costumes cinematography really look james garner lesley ann warren alex karras as well classic
greatest action movie of all time . involved not only war but a perfect mix romance and very good story mel gibson rocks in this choice for any male
honestly one of my favorite movies . the songs are very well written and acting is pretty good few times in life does come upon a movie they don't get tired for me , this them
i just saw chicago this weekend with my parents , and it was excellent . murder sly lawyers sex scandals the stage show dances used for roxie hart's imaganation made a great movie
i think a lot of people expected this movie to fail , but damn don't care loved it . thought the court scenes might have been tad bit overdramatic chemistry between renee and catherine was amazing me majority dance sequences were fantastic who knew could ? great job by anne reinking played roxie on stage with outstanding choreography
best movie ever !
i believe no one in the actin business could have done roles of velma kelly and roxy hart better then renee catherine..no wonder got oscars for roles..thats called talent !
fabulously clever production . very entertaining katherine , renee richard and queen l all wonderful another comment compared to della reese hey i love 'em both has never done anything badly...i her ! she is such a talented lady in the you just shot off my pinkey toe.. scenes...what hoot did angels prostitutes equally as well
loved it ! catherine zeta-jones was wonderful ,
i confess read the other ratings to see where was going go with this . considering renee , catherine and richard were all over televison saying that they really had never sung or danced before did a helluva job queen latifah cool too -- certainly better than della reese in harlem nights surprised story as good it musical little hitchcockian twist at end hoot !
i tend to get annoyed by musicals - but really liked chicago . all of the characters are twisted and conniving... interesting songs dark sarcastic unlike most actually seem like a logical extension character's mindset from richard gere's money hungry lawyer character , he does it for love catherine-zeta jones' act desperation when she feels her star falling queen latifah's mama will take care you each musical bits is brilliant was shocked at how much enjoyed this movie those who have held off seeing because they expect campiness moulin rouge or sound music should give shot it's weird fun flick
amazing acting , dancing and vocals . most of us never knew that the stars movie could sing dance like ! truly fast paced fun i really feel bad for amos though well as billy flynn said that's chicago queen latifa stole show richard gere rocked
really a 4.5 . our family went today i enjoyed this movie it was well done imaginative , and acted like musicals anyway nice to see one on the big screen all actors did good job with their roles considering some had never danced before fine dance numbers found be treat
a spectaculat movie!!! ! renee zelwegger's performance was marginal , but catherine zeta-jones-wow!!!!! i suggest you see the movie it won something like 7 oscars nominated for 13.very good
excellent . best musical put to film ever
with me working at my local cinema , i must say that this film has been the most enjoyable one to view . first thought as a musical would be dry and only apealing fans who had seen west-end verison but was proved wrong whole extreamly entertaining ! plot wasnt outstanding singing acting abilties of performers brilliant bright up-beat songs kept audience in awe costumes were just perfect personaly love movie...its definatly sing along it isnt for younger teen-agers above its great watch is much wanted release from serious dominating movies year
best movie ever!! ! i've seen it nine times and bought the soundtrack its amazing . so is catherine zeta-jones as velma she soooo deserved oscar
amazing movie ! my favorite of all time , the actresses/ actors were fabulous and everything was just perfect!
it is the best movie ever! !
i have to confess that really enjoyed this movie . found it both engaging and entertaining felt the juke-joint feel in , could almost smell smoke dingy little jazz hall
awesome!!!! !
i'm not really the type to like musicals , but i enjoyed this movie and thought it was one of best i'd seen in a long time . there lot more singing dancing than expected surprisingly wasn't bad thing always kept me entertained costumes settings were great visuals
action packed all the way . great acting not quite perfect though
best movie i have seen in awhile .
this movie is everything...and all that jazz ! renee zellweger cute , catherine zeta-jones hot richard gere handsome john c reily creepy and queen latifah brings down the house
first truly gay positive film to hit the mainstream - as in that didn't depict gays evil or tragic .
i rented this movie a year or so ago and had completely forgotten how compelling the story was incredibly well made . acting , production numbers cinematography historical context were all amazing it hasn't lost an ounce of impact 30-plus years when thought to be shocking
very good movie , where the music makes sense in context of plot and isn't just cowboys putting down their lariats breaking into song . minelli grey york are all film is tight
liza got her mom's talent wow ! fabulous movie all round . great sleeze , casting...singing and dancing super! rather racy for its time too lots of topics in this one...loved it
i really liked the night scene and french twist of film . great dancing scenes as well liza minelli is a good actress in this
cabaret is a classic and stands as one of the first overtly political musicals all time . liza minelli perfectly irritating sexy ? english girl who has escaped to work call girl/performer in berlin minelli's star persona acting style combine yield personality that's too fun resist but still somehow repugnant joel gray at his best queer role emcee with bob fosse handling choreography patented use subtlety evoke exciting sex for those you visiting or living new york , there's an ass kicking revival play on broadway directed by sam mendes from american beauty playing now
i love this film ! the cinematography explains so much detail and captures life of protagonists . music , instead how it's worked into storyline normally in musicals is done soely cabaret (leaving out some good songs) there a more natural feeling only movie with liza minelle that she doesn't come across as just horrible actress
this is indeed a great movie and i loved judy garland's songs in it .
this is my all time favorite movie ! judy actress so that might have something to do with it , but just a nice light hearted musical always makes me feel better
this is one of my top 5 favorite movies ! i don't know why beautiful classic isn't more popular . christmas coming , and if anybody reads watch with your kids you will really enjoy it you'll thank me later :)
very well done , with a hand made feel to it that fits the theme . music is great and resists urge over-produce
one of the best rockumentaries ever done . great music throughout (excepting fat old hawkins , but i guess he had to be in there and that pukey untalented n diamond) well edited paced on-screen interviews robertson helm danko manuel hudson were pretty unenlightening (not most talkative or extroverted crew perhaps they laced with something powerful at time) this film is a time capsule mid-1970s terms fashions style era was sorta twilight counterculture truly last gathering rockers 1960s captured on less than year after released punk/new wave ushered new pop culture dominant top it's sad watch today realize are dead has been silenced by throat cancer
even though i hate disco love the soundtrack and this movie so much
greatest... . movie .... ever... !
this is one of my favorites that i sort keep hidden in the closet . can't explain why like movie...i just do ! don't disco music , i'm not a fan travolta but everytime movie on sit down and watch it
i think a lot of folks here are missing the point snf . it's not just about dancing or music , which is all great and entertaining believe me bee gees wrote soundtrack 1970s with that album ! love energizing dance scenes quaint polyester clothes afro hairdos but more than musical - real life gritty urban drama it still relevant today so what if depressing harsh- that's way in blue collar setting tony's escape through contrast to his bleak dysfunctional family friends heart soul movie unlike most other musicals actually has strong relatable story line acting was too characters stand out beyond one-dimensional cardboard cutouts one best movies time
fever was a such cultural phenomenon and it technically wasn't musical . there are so many memorable scenes is really great story of young,urban america in the late 1970's course , bee gees music amazing
in the category of music movies , fever has got best marraige and movie . opening sequence travolta walking to stayin' alive is a classic piece americana as it was 70's bee gees contributions never been equalled by any other fas popularity sales date album sold approx 50 million worldwide quite an achievement for low budget no promotion
it has been said that there never a better marraige of music with movie than in saturday night fever . little do most people know , the bee gees were recording their next album when manager/snf producer took 5 songs from them long before was completed you should be dancing #1 two years snf and jive talkin three earlier definetly great which became way life for time
what other movie captures a period of time better than this film ? the life brooklyn teen with really no future except for his love dancing . plus , there has never been music used in that bee gees we're faces
who can forget his cool shoes and ultimate bell bottoms grooving down the street..or ultra chic 100% polyester shirt that he had to cover with entire napkin so wouldn't get any sauce on it at dinner family . travolta enveloped every aspect of disco king music dancing was top notch for time..sure may make us laugh now , but didn't want be tony ? or tony's girl
i enjoyed this movie about the life of richie valens . don't have any idea how accurate was but it thought esai morales stole show as half brother
okay , i really didn't intend to write a review but what that first girl said annoyed me . of all everyone doesn't share you opinion in movies missy ! and sandra bullock is funny beautiful an awesome actress keanu reeves cute anyways if enjoy action you'll definately this thriller
one of the best films .
i really enjoyed this movie . having been boring in the 1980s , of course wasn't alive times richie valens but enjoy seeing a film which traced his roots lou diamond phillips did great job at bringing back to life and rest cast as well lot music ! it's so sad that richie's was cut tragically short
i love ritchie valens and lou diamond phillips did a great job playing him .
it's a great movie . it shows you the innocence of that time see richie grow up and hardships his family gain understanding life , music touching about musician if anyone loves donna this is must
i thought this movie was a great representation of how difficult it is to make big from nothing , and culture clashes with getting out being pop star . the very entertaining music course wonderful
out of all the action movies that i have seen in past , this was one most thrilling . suspense never faded even though film took place on a bus when actors/actresses paniked with them whole way through what to fall love someone...one trip such as !
la bamba is a great music movie . it's fun to watch which depicts richie valentines career and life well i like the way they had actors portraying parts of other famous musicians interacted with in was
it is an old song/movie but it's great
i thought the movie la bamba was a good . like autobiographies
they should really let baz luhrmann make more movies , he never just shows up and lets the film roll . every time out opens all windows fills movie theatre with fresh air maybe not everything works but you walk away thinking "oh i've seen that before" need wild wreckless imaginative like this one
amazing , epic movie . i won't recant all the qualities it possesses other posts have done a good enough job as is one thing specifically liked was display style of retribution no supreme concepts such forgiveness over revenge or 'revenge bring back dead' theme most modern movies long speeches before wallace expresses his just simple satisifying not that disagree with aforementioned and themes expressed in their appliance to past eras
i loved this movie ! the music and colorful sets suck you in . nicole kidman looks beautiful has a sweet voice (not strongest vocals on her part but quit melodic pretty sounding) was suprised how well ewan mcgregor can sing is such film for so many reasons.i think 2 leads were cast perfectly became fan of after one.
nicole kidman and ewan mcgregor were the perfect love story to watch..i loved every minute of it .
i agree- wonderful movie- enjoyed it immensely!!! ! is true- to love and be loved the greatest thing of all!!
i love this movie so much ! how they incorporate newer songs into their 1900 year scene . it's such a beautiful story with sad ending if could have been in 1 it would one
loved it!! ! the end was sooooo sad though .
i have found that this is one of those movies people either love or hate . luckily for me absolutely it there so much ot discover in movie both heartbreaking and touching with its storyline , breathtaking aesthetic beauty the music just wonderful ewan nicole deserved oscars urge everyone to open their minds give creative masterpiece a try
should be way higher . it was an awesome movie , with great music acting and a story line also excellent cinematography
this was a great film easy to watch ctors starring in it ewan mcgregor and jim broadbank particularly i like baz lurmans other films they have similar style romeo julliet is very good . director actors visual effects
a truly visually stunning and erotic musical !
i didn't want to see this movie because nicole kidman sang and acted in it , which believed that she could do neither . well has come such a long way since her earlier days of being mrs tom cruise not only held own but had pleasant singing voice carried off the part quite like turn century setting with modern music dance sequences were deftly executed placed we started liveliness joviality can moved on dark sexy tango tells story within there was definately lots eye-candy solid acting back up from all sides although basic plot far original (boy meets girl etc) strenght actors who took tragic ending very powerful mcgregors performance you felt his pain if have any baz lurhman's movies one spare yourself velvet goldmine (also starring mcgregor)
the best dang musical i've ever seen.. . brilliant effects.. cutting edige cin-ematography.. great soundtrack... nicole kidman is perfect actress for her role.. ewan macgragor hot....the intergration of old and new music was so awesome!!! ! diamond class movie!! i lvoe it.. do not want to give away a plot becuae you have see it belive it!! one sweet movie!!! will chicago live up this.. we'll about that one!!! ;)
moulin rouge is my favorite music movie . the so wonderful ewan mcgregor has beatiful singing voice and nicole kidman not great to
great movie.. . the best actress is in it and she did a fantastic job ! awesome singer dancer
really wonderful film ! it's so visually stunning to watch , full of vibrant colourful costumes and scenery . on top that the music is fun addictive mostly adapted from famous pop songs used in new inventive ways ewan mcgregor nicole kidman are perfect together i was surprised at how well they performed vocally
a must see,once in lifetime,cinematic masterpiece .
moulin rouge is my most fave movie of all ! it so innovative , makes me sing cry dance and everything isan experience that cannot be forgotten ever!! ewan hot nicole pretty zidler hilarious . i love it!!!
spectacular musical . it sets a new film standard to match - the epic flawless from beginning end painted on richest canvas imaginable...making everything old seem again what surprise was hear kidman/macgregor duets i couldn't wipe smile off my face
wow ! you know , i wasn't sure to see this movie at first since the reviews were very mixed . but finally decided rent it and give a shot was just blown away thought story really good - simple enough be on film complex interesting man i've never fallen so in love with before stories don't usually grab me crying like there's no tomorrow end of one plenty people nicole kidman find her skills dazzling every time ewan macgregor's performance breathtaking i'm glad got him role that allows bear his amazing talent i'll warn is subjective ; didn't if you've been searching for fiercely romantic feast senses isn't your run-of-the-mill drama or hum-drum romantic-comedy then recommend moulin rouge try
fantastic with wonderful performances by all the cast . i have nothing praise for them , especially nicole kidman she acts sings dances does it
when the movie came out , i thought have to go see this . it was a great with lots of action and made audience feel like on that bus one best movies ever seen watched about 10x !
this deserves all your stars time a millin . putting the most beautiful and talented actress ever gorgeous actor on earth together was phenomenal great movie nicole sings so does ewan!!! !
my favourite movie of all time . this is funny , heartbreaking and romantic it's defiantely one for the ages it fabulous with amazing sets dance music two great stars in particular ewan mcgregor to see a boyfriend/girlfriend course if you love any lead actors luhrmann mixes musical such vibrant colour energy originality that will keep wanting more fun film at some points leave smiling laughing from ear e.g juke his 'like virgin' number also make cry or least be moved by powerful performers where actually believe these people are just round off story about beauty freedom truth overcoming obstacles  especially hopeless romantics
baz luhrmann's moulin rouge is perhaps the most wonderfully convoluted film since magnolia  , and it may be better . pure unadulterated cinematic adrenaline full of emptiness glamour power thereof.. manages to pack itself so sheer brilliance that virtually explodes far from perfect this definitely one cinema's eclectic masterpieces moves with pace an electric lightshow through a plot shoestring breadth all any movie romance can muster how does do ? by being something more than i've ever seen before.. it's striking beautiful.. doubtlessly going become inspiration for thousand imitations making best worst mainstream event 2001's cinema collage art truly.. !
i thought it was a fantastic movie . could believe nicole kidman and ewan mcgregor had such beautiful voices !
well what can i say about this movie that hasn't already or soon will be said ? it's absolute pure and unadulterated genius . moulin rouge never for a moment leaves you without some sort of compelling image emotion the actors have powerful chemistry manages to capture audience's attention amidst all frienzied goings-on , assure is quite feat course one would remiss if did not mention shockingly good music ! retooled songs i'm sure sound corny in any other seem fit perfectly singing surprisingly as considering majority it done by two widely known their ability wish could find ways fully express too just how amazing visual..everything like nothing i've ever seen entire life are forever being bombarded with kind elaborate new before unimaginable picture really undescribable baz lurrhman an astonishing job on film camera angles colors sets everything was perfect changed thing minute truly beautiful wasted neither your time go see so get off booty do now command
wow , this movie was amazing . i gaurntee that no one will feel ambivilent about either you'll love it or hate go into with out expectations hope ! sure did
funny movie . i did not want to see this when it was at the theater because sure if would be any good am glad finally watched rick moranis is perfect as seymour nerdy flower shop worker who found a strange and unusual plant turns out only survive on human blood gruesome sounds steve martin hilarious nasty dentist loves hurt his patients ellen greene great audrey love most of songs set in 1960s so lot music 60s style part do like much toward end really gets
a great and funny movie .
this movie is very exciting . it keeps you on your feet i also liked because keanu reeves fine
the most wounderful and genius movie ever diego luna is so sexy i love you a++++++
he's like eye candy!! !
lawdy ! what can i say ?
the movie was brilliant i've watched it 1000 times .
the dancing in this movie is wonderful . my favorite art he end when johnny and baby are music also great movies theme very good
the film is so sweet ! i like it much. . gives me much love and feel not lonely sexy body patrick swayze *g*
ok..dirty dancin isnt a musical..but great dance movie thats for sure . my grandma was the first one who introduced me to when i 3..to this day kno evey word , and in that film still classic ! now can obsess over dirty havana nites..all hav say is diego luna!
great 80's sleeze ! patrick is a dancer (ballet and all) he had some moves here . reminds me of 7th grade dances...what rush jennifer did wonderful job as well really cute movie puts you back to being about 17 years young when watch it i love that part
i personally think this movie is great . it the classic good girl falls for bad boy and they parents hate dancing a big part of but believe that basic has much larger setting than deals with coming to understand ones self how someone could change so easily not always what people
this movie is the best . it always reminds me of my friend b/c time life our song from cheerleading whenever we get into a fight listening to that or seeing brings us back together
speed is the greatest movie because keanu reeves star . sandra bullock good to except when she kisses anyway , i loved this of buildup tension and excitement also like how villan dies at end blood guts decapitation more ; makes a great in my book oh bus rescue/blow up scene was best lots action but love bit between much
i love this movie ! have watched tons of times and will watch it more . is my all-time favorite
this movie is great . it's a total classic ! it has story and fantastic soundtrack the acting good relationships are interesting
this is a classic with one of the best soundtracks all time . patrick swayze hot and dancing really entertaining plot interesting as well i carried watermelon , line you will never forget
growing up in the late eighties/early ninties . i saw this movie all time classic eighties , cheesy music makes it al worthwhile inspires every girl to strive for patrick swayze
dirty dancing is an 80's classic . it equally taboo as cheesy patrick swayze a joy to watch because he's such suave sleazy dancer this movie great for young teens
i love the dancing and choreography . plot of story is interesting actors/actresses are very good
this movie has an excellent soundtrack . it is stocked with sexy actors and actresses the actual plot a you can watch over again
the best coming of age story about a young girl who falls in love with rebel is against everything that had been part her world before she met him . dancing gives great twist , to show how between johnny and baby develops it adds sensual quality movie concludes major dance scene brings together
this is one of the best movies ever produced . it a perfect love story and cinematography excellent has great combination talented actors actresses dirty dancing also an amazing soundtrack what's really about movie that can reach all audiences
this movie is the perfect combination of good music and entertainment . never boring it makes you feel at end every song in film excellent as well
dirty dancing is among my favorite movies . the movie has a wonderful soundtrack and plot keeps attention this that you can watch countless number of times
every girl i know who is my age , watched this movie religiously at sleepovers . it's the best childhood nastoliga of cornball plot ending with dance where baby struts her stuff was so cool then and notorious now fun you can sing along all songs
i find myself watching this film every single time that it is on tv and enjoying each . maybe makes me swayze crazy , but if the shoe fits.. everyone agrees grey are both really good jerry ohrbach also great as baby's father who struggling with some of decisions made by his younger daughter strong soundtrack well even song sung himself
old movie but it was on cable tv the other night , and my family watched again . another one of classic kind movies nice plot with some surprises had enough action
this movie is timeless ! the charachters steal you heart every time . i don't think there a love story that has been made since dirty dancing tasteful enough to share with sixth grader often wonder what happened baby and her first
nothing beats the 'dirty dancing' soundtrack . only thing i don't like is they didn't include spanish song that was playing when baby did her first dance
dirty dancing is a true classic . the and romance was so beautiful i never get tired of watching it
the best movie ever ! patrick swayze , what a hottie
i thought that dirty dancing was the love story hit of 80's .
dirty dancing is my favorite alltime music movie . both the film and soudtrack are fantastic
this was one of the best movies ever made ! dancing great & soundtrack awesome .
the music is romantic as well .
absolutely 'boy's own' fiction...superb stuff . an adventure that has you rooted to the spot
finally a movie that at least somewhat explains why the scot's , and irish resent british rule so much.great battle scenes ! lot's of blood gore an awesome plot storyline.one few movies can combine love story historical millitary fiction massive amounts violence not come off cheesey .
great movie and music .
this is my favorite musical , and i don't really like musicals . robert preston shirley jones were both great in movie a very young ronnie howard was also the opinion classic !
the music man is my favorite musical . robert preston just bursts with energy movie terrific from clever opening song on train to end shirley jones was great too what a wonderful voice she had roster of charactr actors- paul ford , pert kelton hermione gingold ,buddy hackett and charles lane plus let's not forgett ronnie howard
i am a big musical fan . and the music man is one have loved watching since childhood robert preston perfect as harold hill shirley jones was good too ronnie howard just adorable tunes are clever do not think will ever be able to sing along you've got trouble lol movie about con artist who tries sell idea of boys bands with method falls in love piano teacher
excellent movie even if you don't like country music (like me) .
excellent film adaption of loretta lynn's autobiography . sissy spacek does an incredible job starring as , and even her own singing she certainly deserved the oscar for work entire cast is great though it's just amazing to see how far came make dreams come true
a wonderful movie the autobiography of lorretta lynn . played to perfection by sissy spacek it starts out when is 13 and takes through about her thirties she famous at top popularity looks like an honest portrayal this country singer , tommy lee jones was also good as husband deserved oscar won playing role even did all own singing
excellent classic movie . judy garland's performance was incredible
yeah , the storyline is quite cheesy but oh choreography it's so timeless ! fred and ginger's chemistry cannot be eclipsed by anyone else . songs are good too
the lovely music , spectacular dancing great personalities of fred and ginger superbly funny faces performances eric blore edward e horton erik rhodes - what more could you ask for? !
this is my favorite fred astaire film . the story line total fluff , and some of editing sketchy but oh ! dancing takes you to that 1930s fantasy world where everyone glamorous everything has a happy ending people just suddenly find themselves wonderful stuff
this cdis kool and dont even like rock that much my fav . is "another brick on the wall"
this movie is definetly for pink floyd fans
the wall was greatest rock opera of all time . animations were amazing and bob geldof an excellent choice to play pink movie is kind hard grasp at first if you have never listened or floyd but still
pretty good music and great animation.this movie made some heavy statements about war the business,but it's depressing .
what an amazingly complex and great movie ! i've seen this at least 30 times over the last 20 years i always see new things have realizations . dvd version with comments by waters scarfe demonstrates just how much thought was put into making sure stayed true to vision message summary : quality of music goes without saying , wall is a floyd masterpiece animation powerful acting fills out characters entire concept it's stories within multiple layers meaning stretches mind one caution though topic depressing it helps be very familiar lyrics album before seeing also you really need watch more than once for loops time other time.. story line not linear enjoy
the meaning of wall is that we r all in this confusion together and killing yourself not way out people go through same emotions high times low
the first time i saw this movie , was weirded out but now like it alot . very visual and strange with a great soundtrack too
one of the greatest concepts in music history . all credit to pink floyd (especially roger waters) for coming up with such an amazing album from that , came a blockbuster movie when i think allan parker fame commitments may come mind some however this outdoes them as far parker's directing skills go truly ages
oh , c'mon man ! like there's a better one ?
saw it 400 plus times , have all the best lines memorized and still continue to watch from time . isn't that enough for a five rating ?
an amazing movie/music experience that must be seen multiple times (perferably in altered mind states) to truly appreciated as the wonderful masterpiece it is . includes lots of symbolism and crazy animation believed
i gave this movie a 5 because love pink floyd . truth to tell , will never ever watch again it's absolutely miserable the animation sequences are billiant and disturbing structure of is quite...unique when saw it left feeling confused suicidal according my best friend that qualifies an effective work art yes very music amazing makes all worth
don't listen to the stoners who think you have be high enjoy this movie , they're losers anyway . all need is a brain and an appreciation for music (if neither substitute blunt might it also.)
the wall is a classic . combination of cartoons and actors pink floyd's music make this movie must-see for all it was done in early 80's , far beyond it's time! !
best enjoyed with a blunt .
the best : negative love sydrome
fame was a movie that tells you need to have proper desire goals for life
i am a huge doors fan and could not believe how much val kilmer looked like jim morrison in this movie just glad they picked somebody who wasn't going to lip sync
one of my all-time favorite films ! the doors have always been musicians and val kilmer's performance is best in cinema history if you ask me he looked sounded like morrison every way excellent film
val kilmer's astounding , accurate portrayal of jim morrison's life and character is what makes this movie great . also the cinematography pretty breathtaking when they trip in desert one my all time favorite movies
this is one of the greatest music movies . you gain insight to what made them who they were i love doors and think jim morrison a great writer movie showed aspects his life that lead destruction
great movie with a sad ending . he was talent engulfed by self indulgence the showed creativity behind man such waste of it is really
the movie is really well made , but not cast...(except for val kilmer) . meg ryan should be playing jim morrison's wife/girlfriend still by end of it was very hard me to separate morrison from kilmer he does an excellent job do watch this if you are in love with you'll come out despising him cinematically superb
iloved the doors . it was a great flick
incredible documentary . my one complaint is that they film hendrix from chest up you don't get to see him play
in my opinion , alvin lee and ten years after stole the show with going home . but whole movie was great
best documentary
in my opinion , the best documentary ever made and filmed concert . cinematography is first rate dvd contains footage not included original release including a top notch performance by janis joplin what sets this one above rest only performances but filmmaker's inclusion of interviews with artists concertgoers workers at townspeople who were invaded event people put together it's much more than just it captures time society great historical document
one of the best documentaries ever made . footage (split screen) performances is incredible , as well offstage interviews with musicians and hippies boy i can smell reefer right now
excellent movie that even has a good story line . it takes place in the early 1900s jewish farmer is reluctant to change his traditions changing world where tradition for matchmakers , find husbands daughters tyeve{sp} want marry men they love.the papa decide he should stick with traditon or think about happiness there are some wonderful songs if i were rich man matchmaker sunrise sunset,very well acted, only criticism would have bit too long
this movie is a classic . i loved the storyline keanu good actor bus was kool
oy , comon this movie is a classic ! songs and so well done . never been another close to it depicting tradition ...songs from played at my wedding dinner was married under chuppa .. be mench admit great the theatre vesions of were also
madonna..5 stars all the way..and an oscar! !
madonna rules !
marilyn at one of her best thats also in the diamond collection i love always will .
one of my very favorite musicals because the great stars : fred astaire , nanette fabray cyd charisse etc . excellent performances singing dancing acting love it !
wow , this is a brilliant film ! first of all i am big fan nanette fabray who had huge role in movie . she did fabulous job and multi-talented : singing dancing acting comedienne etc fred astaire was at his best the storyline both fun intriguing one musicals ever made
i've been a fan of the dazzling,debonair and peerless fred astaire for many years.for me,the band wagon pips even top hat swing time as his most brilliant film,and is prime contender musical crown singin' in rain , which preceded it by year.packed with marvellous tunes dance routines- cyd charisse surely elegant talented partner ; dancing dark sublimely romantic;the extended vibrant girl hunt sequence both sexy visually stunning.the second half simply fabulous (over an hour unadulterated bliss) charisse's closing speech will bring lump to throat any fellow devotee.that's entertainment !
considering the budget they had and script , beatles did a fab job on this . it is very funny goes with out saying that music great plays like big video so really was first mtv should send 10% of every thing make to for inventing videos
it really depicted , brilliantly the innocence and human side of fab four . this has got to be most underrated music movie/documentary all time
this should be in the #1 spot . beatles are best and movie is greatest
it really was the beatles who began putting visual aid to their music . analysts still now look on this movie from mid '60s for inspiration great theatrical pictures
my favorite movie of all time ! this was not ridiculous , and the soundtrack weak . is it a crime for someone to be silly ? horrible that i laughed out loud there are so many great scenes in boys get themselves which shows younger generation(like me) how beatlemania really performances especially love can't buy me number on field have question you who gave less than 5 stars i'm 13 would rather watch hilarious beatles or some x-rated
a great movie that allowed the world to get know outrageous personalities of beatles . music is , course and each one fab four do good job acting possibly first video
great because it's the who performing songs - not actors . for those familiar with plot sort of a "west side story" set in london teenager , jimmy feels like he's going schizophrenic actually quadrophenic as he tries to please his 1) gang 2)parents 3)job and 4)girl getting pulled 4 different directions concept by pete townshend is that there musical themes correspond band members which corresponds personalities music blends very well rent it on dvd so you can put english subtitles some dialog hard understand accents
i love this film ! represent sthe war of mods vs rockers wonderfully . (i wasn't even thought then!) sting was fantastic in as the rest cast there were certainly quite a few familiar faces well
surprisingly enjoyable . only having seen horrid high school adaptions before , the movie was a big entertaining surprise mary tyler moore is much more than laura petrie or richards great ijr says check it out !
i liked both versions , although found the 90s version to be much darker . judas goes heaven in original but hell newer all of older was filmed outdoors and indoors they godly chorus altered more satan's ("good old poor judas" carries different meaning for instance) it's based on book john which ironically is most anti-jewish gospels (refers bad guys as "the jews" while synoptic refer merely scribes pharisees sadducees." so ironic that one liberal interpretations christ least gospel
sorry to say this but the original is way better than sgt . pepper's lonely hearts club band
the original 1970's version is trully one of worst movies ever made , ranking down there with peter frampton in sgt pepper's . reason i gave this four stars for 2000 remake which believe was released direct to video ond dvd that deserves *****! ! it tremendous check out if you have never seen
great rock opera portraying the last 7 ays in earthly life of christ . musical score is with songs that are unforgettable
i love this musical ! the music is well suited , and performers in original are great . i'm not so fond of recent adaption it though.. sure who they're trying to appeal with those bondage-demons at end
one of the best action movies i've ever seen . too bad sequel sucks
high society is a wonderful musical . in some ways it can be said to the perfect convergence of those revolutionary talents who dominated american popular music first half twentieth century louis armstrong was perhaps dominant force defining his sense rhythm and genius for improvisation left its indelible mark on jazz has every other type modern bing crosby most underrated musician he , along with ethel waters invented singing style if you doubt that listen were big stars before people like rudy vallee or al jolson then nothing ever same after him needs about talent frank sinatra there are two numbers particular stand out sing now well did evah ?  each practically tutorial how tremendously gifted somewhat varied use complement one another create true work art process sublime movie also boasts witty cole porter score beauty grace kelly worth seeing
life changing film . exemplifies conflict between popular culture and religious fever the music is a compilation of 80's classics timeless movie teen angst it deals with , through dance rock meta structure small town mentality changes
i like kevin bacon , and footloose . this movie made me dance often
footloose is the movie that made me want to get up and dance , it probably my favorite music .
princes purple rain was the last album that i loved after they were ok but movie saw it in theatre tour 85
i didnt really pay attention to the movie..prince was hot look away from !
a terrific movie , fantastic music great choreography everything you could possibly want in .
this is the story of ruth etting , 1920's torch singer and her abusive relationship with husband a gangster . james cagney earned best actor oscar nomination for role doris day just wonderful in part she sings dances emotes excellent results surprised fans critics heretofore untapped talent movie was big hit at time its release soundtrack no.1 bestselling album if you can listen to sing has an extraordinary delivery
my kid loves it , but creeped me out as a .
i use to sing the title song in private school on some field trip saw this movie again years ago a very small theatre first showing was sold out so had wait several hours for next
one of the funnist , most original cartoons i have ever seen . then saw it after imbibing a few six-packs and was even better am begining to wonder if beatles weren't on some mind-altering drug when this movie made but course they would never do anything like that!! !
another great beatles movie . although they didnt do the voices are show at end
it's the beatles ! guys , of course great . animation is neat and kind psychedelic music taken from sgt pepper magical mystery tour (i think) revolver genre (right?) if you see new release version there's also a clip that was originally cut out hey bulldog movie funny pretty
one of the best movies . a thrill that's worth seeing twice in theater very smart and brilliant
yellow submarine by the beatles is best . they are smoking out music my dad got me into
yellow submarine is awesome . the way they mix cartoons and psychadelic things together great songs , witty humor - it just overall a classic
the yellow submarine was an awesome music video . beatles rule ! i can't wait for movie
i absolutely love this movie . treat williams was definitely the star of show soundtrack is excellent when he dances on table and sings got life i've been watching ever since little to my fathers horror used sing some racier songs out loud (i had no idea what those words meant) berger a great character , never fail cry at end every time
a snapshot of the summer love , idealism and excess hippies rigidness rich terror war . one most enduring things about this film is way it portrays how freedom from social ethics brings joy passion but also has shadow side lyrics push limits even by todays standards vocal parts harmonys are still some best today
the music is great in musical . compared to live show , story at end flipped a bit but it beautfully done film deals with war which very relevant us right now break out that pipe wipe off dust and watch hair
give me that beautiful hair ! long , grow it show as i can my down to here there . - theme song
i loved hair . wish could see it live the songs are terrific and so were actors
milos forman directed this musical that was made and released at the wrong time (1979) . it would have probably been a blockbuster if were during film depicts but it's still great movie , fun performances are quite good especially considering leads (treat williams beverly d'angelo john savage) not known as singers choreography by twyla tharp fits right in with feel of kinda to see charlotte rae (mrs garrett from facts life tv show) nell carter (who belts out couple songs) small cameos
hair is one of my favorite movies . this possibly because i wish that (or used to...) lived in the 60's music great , acting if you like trip interludes has 2...i think they get stoned and then later drop acid fun to watch i'm not going give away ending but will say it's a good
my favorite elvis movie
truly a jewel in the crown of king . black and white musical extravaganza , be sure not to miss this dancing singing classic though acting script may tops you know you're really just watching see those hips swivel one more time
this movie is way better than king creole . his 3rd before he was in the army came out after don't miss !
long before reality tv there was gimme shelter . this when the stones really were greatest rock band on planet no other documentary comes close to drama and excitement of movie very excellent film will entertain you , then shock astound
welcome to woodstock with more action and better music . this is the build up classic stones show at altamont hell's angels provided security for concert they also stabbed a man(who , in fairness was brandishing gun) death beat hell out of many others including marty from jefferson airplane one times quite surreal gimme shelter apocalypse now rockumentarys must see any rolling fan it filmed height their musical prime
five stars - just for the appearance of louis armstrong his all with unforgettable james stewart!! !
the songs are terrific- ray walston as devil is acting to remember good-bye old girl best of
this is based on a cole porter play ; and it holds up very well . also , porter's was shakespeare's taming of the shrew so plot involving war sexes timeless kathryn grayson feisty kate her voice suited to sophisticated music howard keel charismatic as strutting male who bound tame one many favorite moments when sings i hate men both them had co-starred in boxoffice smash hit 1951 show boat ann miller tap-dances superb number solo she joins other exciting dancers group among these great are : tommy rall bobby van carol haney bob fosse comedy turns by team keenan wynn james whitmore plus
it may not have been historically accurate in every detail but this film did an excellent job capturing the essence of a righteous cause and valor honesty great scottish hero william wallace . i so completely moved , excited or entertained by many years mel gibson was at his very best portraying as strong determined kindhearted man somewhat reluctant thrilling to experience for first time on big screen definitely must my personal video collection if you want know more about real read john mackay s book (william brave heart) pure excitement both myth legend watch future movie classic braveheart  !
politically incorrect and loving it .
john cameron mitchell may have stolen the show to get recognition and most possible camera time , but he deserves every single frame . this movie is hilarious touching genuinely interesting as opposed its assumed predecessor rocky horror picture film actually explores gender stereotypes instead of just portraying them what they are at face value only ever that i left theater absolutely positive loved it
hilarious movie , heartwarming and a fabulous soundtrack .
this movie is a tour de force . john cameron mitchell portrays hedwig , german-born transexual who becomes down and out then up coming rock star in an unforgettable performance miriam shor also great her supporting role as hedwig's husband(?) band mate well michael pitt tommy gnosis protege-turned-nemesis the music (written by stephen trask performed actual actors) rocks.. big time story characters are among most unique creative recent cinema it features animated sequences that at times sweet odd provocative there tremendous humor dark dry otherwise deeply felt message we must look to ourselves rather than others become complete for film join rocky horror picture show one of greatest subversive musicals all soundtrack cd worth your investment
i love musicals about earlier time periods , like oliver ! is from . kids and they're so cute also annie in a way similar the 19th century always has intrigued me
very good performances and dance numbers . oldest brother adam finds a wife , to take home insprires younger brothers do the same so they go town kidnap six potential wives over winter  : sobbin' women grow like men then there are seven brides for songs entertainment
wonderful movie ! great dance scenes and a cast help make this one of my all time favorite movies grant
bette midler is the best actress
i really love this movie and think rosalind russell gave a sterling performance as mama rose . based on the life of gypsy lee (played by natalie wood) , it showed how pushed her daughters into stardom in vaudeville days wanted to be star herself lived vicariously through excellent songs - everything's coming up roses for film
clints the man . what a tough dude
gypsy is a great musical starring natalie wood as rose lee and rosalind russel the mother . they made later version with bette midler , but this one clearly better
forget the (quite typical)plot contrivances:here's another glorious winner for astaire-rogers fans to revel in.peerless jerome kern score- way you look tonight,pick yourself up,a fine romance..-and a stream of breathtaking dance routines,with fred dazzling as ever and ginger at her most radiant.the never gonna sequence is me peak their legendary partnership;not only sparkling,graceful romantic,but also tremendously touching.sublime moments that always leave gulping .
just about the best rock opera because it set bar for all others that followed . it's soundtrack is who's brilliant 1969 tommy album takes you on exhilarating biographical journey of walker , a deaf dumb and blind boy after its viewing this certainly an unforgettable film fans
'dirty harry' set the standard for all cop movies , though it is relatively underrated . as good clint eastwood andy robinson on par treacherous scorpio this truly a great movie
splendid display of the eras rock performers . themes in movie are not simply esoteric , symbolic imagery is powerful impressive and insightful musical performances phenomenal storyline inspiring
this musical movie is a definite must see . it appears mostly to the younger crowds because of its rocking sound track written originality by who pretty absurd topic therefore will keep you entertained and interested how can not be in deaf dumb blind kids obssesed with pinball
one of the best series , and with a classic line too . do you feel lucky punk ? well
a hard days night was basically day in the life of beatles . help has more plot but is just as funny and fab four are great considering their limited acting experience music geer twists never ending
this is the greatest movie ! it so funny and shows how werid yet normal beatles were as individuals
very funny . i love the beatles
this is a great movie by the greatest , most legendary band ever . so original and funny beatles get to be themselves which an advantage for them us all it's with fab soundtrack what can i say anything !
i love the beatles ! this movie is so funny and helps to show personality traits of each beatle .
an excellent movie about clint eastwood taking the law in his hands , weeding out scumbags of society and making streets san francisco safer
i am commenting on the original version....fabulous . classic unforgettable songs...bali hi is calling...gotta go ;-)
this song always reminds me of my childhood .
i thought this film was a greatly crafted little slice of nostalgia . it doesn't try to be an epic , just fairly faithful-feeling depiction the ride that group kids got go on when one their songs catches wave and becomes national hit one-ders are typical band playing for reasons - music money meeting chicks they accidentally big time record company changes name wonders top only fall apart as slides down charts mr white manager says "the very common tale." there's hardly wrong note played in whole thing sadly overlooked tom hanks's resume
the king...the king...i mean , that's enough but ann-margaret is amazing as well . she dances like a spasticated idiot it's so much fun to watch and acting - bad that how could you not think brilliance!!!! ! when he looses his money in pool stupid hysterical you've gotta love forte four singing cheek cheek.. song check out songs didn't make it into film you're boss king sex
elvis is the king and anything with him in it gets a 5 from me
viva las vegas is the greatest ! ok elvis movies tend not to be great pieces of art , but dude exudes charisma . thing about that ann margaret almost able upstage king i didn't think it was possible -- check her out as she duets lady loves me.. doesn't know yet it's just classic forever!
really good movie video , gotta love it the music is great actors are and characters how could you say terrible to such a creation .
worth another look . an early brian depalma flop that is a great little 70's period piece the faust saga told as if it were phil specter who sold his soul and paul williams' (remember him?) greatest moment on silver screen
truly a masterpiece ! this movie has it all : acting , directing and producing was incredible .
the quintessential clint eastwood movie . a great script , excellent direction and one of all-time loathesome villians scene where villain pays someone to beat him up is worth price rental all by itself
i love the seamless way that coppola mixes a gangster film and jazz into one , without any of tired corny clichs you find in lot latter day musical (until final sequence when it totally catches off balance) . its also very effective using historical figures events as backdrop to fictional story incredible cast nicholas cage is at his best an early role bob hoskins fred gwynn are brilliant richard gere actually acting instead being young diane lane interest period recreation pitch-perfect with duke ellington cab calloway charlie chapin louis armstrong showing up piece where they inter-splice gregory hines's solo tap dance hit on dutch schultz finest moments has ever filmed
i liked it because the music was integral to plot and not just lets put down our tommy guns belt out a tune .
if you don't give dirty harry 5 stars , then are probably from france . the definitive movie in pantheon of clint eastwood movies do feel lucky ? well punk
the bee gees are good in this film but aerosmith suck - as usual !
this film wastes a lot of talent except for aerosmith who suck ! the only redeeming thing about is few well performed songs by bee gees
the movie is so campy that it's good . bee gees do save film even though they don't speak one word of dialogue as a side note , begged to get out this but their contract obligations forced them remain
the story was silly and pointless but singing of bee gees saved whole thing . they made it worthwhile
love it , . silly and campy ? you betcha does that matter hell no ! great live performances from the ramones this soundtrack is riff randall a character
still got my rock n roll soundtrack on vinyl sighned by the ramones good movie not too happy with a remake
eastwood singing is worth the rental alone , but lee marvin belting out wandering star a lifetime memory .
i can never watch this again without thinking of the hiliarious simpson parody it !
i don't think realized how much liked this movie until the bourne supremacy previews started coming out . was so excited for sequel , that appreciated identity it a clever story and action fast paced without being over top
hands down the greatest piece of film greatness ever made .
a great movie . the dark second act to original triolgy , characters become more real good guys are very bad and war rages
alright , maybe this flick has more twists and turns ; however you must state that the first movie was better in it started series really established a genre .
still the best , watchable funny and has a few of sequences in entire 'star wars' series .  .the asteroid field yoda's training luke finding out that he real family issues .it's darkest star wars films
yes it did deserve to play in the summer time lostboy should move on this website he's a opinionated jerk
this movie is........................................................................................................................................................ .
this movie and the other 5 will long endure for generations to come.of course they have already spanned 4 decades .
ive reviewed a lot of movies and the empiere is best ! greatest made move all i has toched my life so much its by far most unforgetable thing in no classic to get neare it incredable for sound john willoms you will never see loving cool as this one awsomly have always love at-ats awsome scene first fight betten darth vader luke skywalker got admit these been sence when tell am your father every date looks upon that scence because good theres hundred watch two days not kidding some times day long time seen from 1980-ever look real unbelieabe can ever reach or begain empirer if there god bless gorage lucas irvin kershner,harrison ford , carrie fisher mark hamill anthony daniels may star wars!!!!!forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this has got to be my favourite star wars film . it's interesting note that george lucas did not write the screenplays or direct last two films in original trilogy one was directed by irvin kershner
this is still the best star wars movie . it has special effects and a lot of plot turns i am not sure about yoda , mean did he have to be muppet enhanced version great can wait for dvd must see any sci-fi fan
great movie . very , solid throughout with good action sequences acting etc how in the hell can this be rated worse than die another day and face/off?! ?
best of the holy trilogy (don't count others.....garbage,complete garbage)
the greatest sci fi movie ever !
one of the best movie i've watched , good endings stories lots character in depth and background special effect for that time costume era genius sequeal plan .
great film .
a great sci fi movie . awesome cast , effects nice story line and well ahead of it's time
this is my favorite film fron the star wars trilogy ! a sequel that equally genius to first one-amazing
definitely the best of star wars series . it is dark , defining and sets up most important battle in universe
my personal favorite of all star wars films to date . this film explores the slightly deeper character traits our young rebels , and leaves audience with realization that maybe good doesn't always triumph over evil empire strikes back was better than original without question
the best of series! ! 'erg
the best of series . no long intros , jump right in it kept swashbuckler spirit yet elevated story to timeless myth
the best star wars movie ever ! great plotline , action special effects and battles!!
my favorite film in series of films all time . so much to see this movie , and it's great it does leave you hanging a way but they had stop somewhere i guess any case is film-making at absolute best there are many memorable scenes...the battle on hoth with the imperial walkers luke being captured by wampa creature audience sees him really use force for first pull lightsaber into his hand learning be jedi dagobah we get meet that lovable yoda millenium falcon flying asteroid belt only learn belly huge space slug han leia escaping cloud city they've been betrayed lando calrissian vader face what probably duel movies getting severed wrist then finding out moments later father wonderful scenes situations wish everyone could feel do about
i would rate all the films in original triology great but like most people(star wars fans paticular) have to say this film is my favorite chapter of one big movie . were everything started getting interesting han and leia falling love , darth vaders stunning confession absent fatherhood yodas revealtion another jedi you get point still star offered action cliffhanger type moments best balanced three fav part was when yoda lifted x-wing out swamp accompanied by john williams powerful score for me that scene summed up what where about as compared empire who only used power personal gain control
the bomb
the most critically acclaimed of all star wars movies , it wasn't my favorite but i liked same . deep in it's own way and a great building up climax to return jedi
hey ! this isn't at the top of sw list? i'll fix that all other five-star reviews pretty much sum up what i have to say ; definitely still very best entry in saga , kicking drama and action a big notch or two . only yet-to-be-produced episode 3 has potential surpass one slim chance 1980 fx stand well greatest scores time along with trilogy entries oh btw strongly recommend way see movie is widescreen copy original version esb 1997 sped rather irritatingly screwed few sequences whenever lucas gets around putting classic on dvd hope he sticks an edit-your-own-edition feature...i can dream can't ? :)
best film of the original trilogy .
empire is the best of star wars trilogy
arguably the best of star wars movies . it's alot darker and foreboding than first one tighter predecessor too it also has a very good shot at being science fiction movie all time , if you ask me ! excellent
easily the best of star wars trilogy . beginning battle was awesome , yoda darth vadar battles were all perfect it had an open ending and a poweful which kicked ass dialogue much improved from first too
best movie ever
america's mythology embodied in the richest , most intricate film of star wars saga . character development and plot twists make this best bunch harrison ford will never be matched terms intensity embodiment a space buccaneer
this is one of the best sci-fi sequels in history . it created a darker mood than star wars : new hope , and really depth to characters film luke becomes stronger learns his ties darth vader as filler movie trilogy still holds its own for spaghetti space western remains most fun action packed stories american pop culture
this is by far the best star wars movie . it reveals to luke who his father also introduces bad ass character boba fett it's a must see
empire was the perfect second act . star wars introduced characters , created rules brings up conflict and jedi resolves it from a directorial standpoint has least lagtime it's tight compact with no excess wonderful stuff
empire strikes back is the best star wars movie . it was different from all other ones because didn't have a space battle and bad guys won characters were in (like bounty hunters) , there weren't as many corny looking aliens
darker than the others , of course but that only serves to make it worthy its twin brethren . absolutely amazing
best of the series
the only way to enjoy science fiction is remember that it's meant for kids .
perfect spy movie
best star wars have to love it when the bad guys win at end . makes a movie better
the finest adventure movie ever made .
alright , i'll admit it . i'm a star wars geek although granted i don't have room in my house dedicated to and didn't sleep on the sidewalk get tickets latest three travesties that being said do love despite mediocre acting special effects are now considered laughable find myself still enjoying its uncomparable other sci-fi flicks because started genre is hallmark of fun entertaining has made george lucas ridiculously wealthy man
still the best
this movie put us in such awe , how could it not be a 5 ? most deserving of any on list is original star wars . the that changed sci-fi forever
this flick is the best of lot . it establishes genre now i'll admit that first sequel or two weren't bad , but overall was climax entire gaggle six movies last three were indifferent to stinker
showed the world what special effects were all about.way ahead of it's time back in 1977.unforgetable,in a word .
i am a fan of star wars since i've seen it in the last five months . well written , played and equally loved is best trilogy ever
despite its average acting , it's still a wonderful fairy tale for generation of people who grew up without tales . had big impact on my childhood empire strikes back was first novel at 9 
ive been a fan all my life and loved the characters of star wars . has toched allways will it brings me joy to go wal'marts or other cool stores see thousands up on toys every thing else you can think god bless gorage lucas for bring so much happiness...
i will start by saying what say here is the absolute truth! ! have seen original motion picture in theaters over 500 times . there a witness though not him since release of esb anyway... this fact was greatest ever made up until 1981's empire strikes back now am huge fan ep , ii  iii looks like mr lucas reverting to yesteryear with story and tale telling all those who did care for it cannot fault you if were 7-12 years old when movie first came out truly missed great ride unfortunately are stuck likes jar binks... get though..
the best in series and movie ever ! when you see words star wars at beginning hear that music than know your watching a classic . this is my favorite of all time because it had loads wonderful special effects , excellent humor colorful characters an intriging story always will be rewatchable if don't like then i have pity on
the best in series .
fun to watch , and more in-depth story-based than a lot of other sci-fi flicks . solid classic
an incredible science-fiction adventure . this movie has everything : good defeating evil , humorous dialogue great characters special effects and more a classic
a classic film . must see
great movie , i liked how c3po and r2d2 walk the desert on planet for a good quarter of it gives you chance to understand get know them there humor better later in movies . makes think little bit is simple parts but still very complete perfect
hands down , my favorite series of movies all time . i happen to prefer the empire strikes back but that's probably because it was first one saw in theater (when barely 5 years old) this has elements a great story and its characters come across as real unlike new prequels special effects were stunning for - still are restored version (not updated expanded version) is amazing blows away any cg graphics realism believability if you can't find your heart at least enjoy star wars believe have no soul
a lot of fun , and reasonably well scripted acted . much the best trilogy
this is simply the best film ever made . no other movie has such an impact on me when i was little just sat in front of old black and white tv with a cheap vcr watched star wars twenty times day still love to watch it must've seen thousand , literally
my absolute favorite film ! the thing that makes star wars so spectacular is it a true original . when was released , there nothing else like out and i don't think anything compares has become huge part of our history culture
i say one of the greatest movies ever made absolutely love stars wars series
if only the original cliffhangers that inspired this had been one-tenth as good .
the ultimate sci-fi adventure ! one of best movies ever
without a doubt , the most important film of last half 20th century . this brought film-making into whole new light completely changed way industry handled movies it created term summer blockbuster and also made merchandising almost as itself (this isn't always good thing) what really makes fantastic for me is that takes back to childhood i was shy nine years old when came out didn't have any idea enormous success turned be just knew loved we acted scenes from movie had hours fun doing my cousin who wasn't nearly well-versed in star wars script would take direction act swing safety scene lightsaber battles using small tree branches necessary all while telling her say do director's work hard anyway so much it's because now mention people role their eyes at they think that's like talk about aren't totally wrong must admit there an acquaintance mine turns nose up whenever words  don't tell wouldn't them if she acts some weird thing nobody gets but try explain billions dollars ticket sales says only can't get through thick head races creeds colors i've met toy stores grandchildren said very innocently your will love we're not buying our us ! appeals ages too guess wondrous hate life
this movie was really great.changed the face of science fiction.it is easily best star wars even though it first one and had inferior technology..every single actor did their role very well.harrison ford magnificent..it an epic
the sf benchmark . you love it - know do a must-see for everyone
one of my all time favorite movies , hands down .
the # origional star wars movies are 3 of greatest all time !
if star wars were thrown into middle earth , the world of lord rings it would not be high art tolkien s elves rather is more mundane entertainment hobbits to enjoyed in comfort home and friends with a fairly basic story good evil told retold . its tale stuff legend repeated over through ages heroes preceded by others such as arthur lancelot or robin hood ; fair maiden needing rescue guinevere maid marian sage old man magic merlin darth vader empire saxon enemies sheriff nottingham his soldiers tiny but brave force facing seemingly invincible foes like david goliath joseph campbell used luke skywalker an example hero quest mythology well appeal familiarity there are i think couple other reasons for tremendous success sequels first all when was released special effects unsurpassed stunning most who saw movie casting inspired young unknowns mark hamill harrison ford carrie fisher action figures unquestioned integrity alec guinness gave power soul role obi wan kenobi that key line has stayed us may you !
this was the first movie where question not , have you seen it ? but how many times and usually followed by wanna see again there is little i can add to previous comments . a ground breaker..it made want more nothing even sequels ever came close
i saw this as an adult when it first came out and have watched many times since . the story characters still grip me , even knowing where plot leads i'm on edge of my seat for final flight scenes everything from casting to soundtrack then-revolutionary special effects makes a great movie !
this is on my top 10 list .
excellent sci-fi drama ! although lucas borrowed heavily from a number of different toho/kurosawa films , he put together the ideas to make something truly astonishing . i consider empire strikes back be best in entire series star wars would have come close second and besides any movies is far better than matrix
star wars is far and away the best science fiction movie , no other movies can compare to ultimate .
star wars gets a 5 rating from me . i can remember my dad packing family up in the car to drive an extra 40 minutes into downtown san diego so that we could see on what was then biggest screen area and boy it worth at 10 8 years old brother went insane for , by far greatest thing we'd ever seen big or anywhere else matter empire good too but new different anything before is basic fight between evil really story has been explored film rejuvinated setting of galaxy away think wonderfully cast with each lead characters being spunky powerful just vulnerable enough keep us rooting them can't say bad about genius its time
*the* movie . mythopoiesis as it should always be : deep rooted , intelligent autoironic and sweeping in concept highly enjoyable a trip outer space with all the trimmings of genre superlative achievement
star wars is the pioneer of special effects movies . difference sw and many todays 'special effects' showcases that it had an excellent sf storyline which made for sequels adventure gets better with repeatedly viewing although in this movie appear contrived compared to today's , one has look very closely notice mistakes prime reason george lucas later re-made original into what should have been first time excellently cast good direction story : darth vader absolute personification arch villain a classic versus evil
in a time long ago...in galaxy far away.. .
all-time great classic ! i loved this movie and like usual , gene hackman was fantastic
i'm not sure i can say anything about this movie that hasn't already been said . it's only the greatest sci fi of all time , but period ! wouldn't be what it is today had for star wars
the best movie made is no match for star wars , aliens actors directing everything poured into making and filming of this great .
the first real sci-fi film , with good effects and humor .
the greatest movie ever made ! i love this any and all star wars movies are best you have to great space saga . idea of light sabers jedi , use all-powerful force is brilliant george lucas man
some of the acting may be less than great (ahem) but this film is just so much fun to watch ! lucas created a complete universe that easy for audience believe in and become part . also , he stuck with one oldest story/myth progressions all time which i think why works well enjoyable (that goes whole trilogy really) even sfx looked better sci-fi films followed next 15 years until cgi really hit its stride who didn't want hans solo when they were young (boys anyway) because had coolest ship sidekick galaxy..
this is the science fiction movie . despite it's revolutionary making technology , classic good vs evil plot makes for family entertainment space age western should be measuring pole all movies
i first saw star wars about 6 years ago , and was instantly transfixed by it  . the effects are spectacular story is so interesting if me boonta23 were in a trivia contest we would be unstopable! !
this is the original disaster movie . my favorite scene was when stella stevens fell into fire , i'm sorry but she nagged her poor husband ernest borgnine to death and took gene hackmans side on everything seriously though best in shelley winters swim makes you wonder if would have guts make that i still
i first saw this movie in third grade , told my friend about it and now we can't get enough of star wars . were both excited over the new release phantom menace got action figures books you name have cannot wait until 2002 next comes out
this movie is another of the great movies all times . it creates a modern mythology while never losing sense 'story'
love it . the best movie i have ever seen has plot and scenes that never forget
star wars had state of the art technology for it's time . darth vadar is best villan all this a must see sci-fi fans
star wars defined a generation . this is no kid-flick with cheesy cute kids the age old struggle between good and evil , right wrong light dark proved that longevity could be achieved not by special effects which are pretty childish today's standards but story
great ! the original and still best . he could have stopped there special effects costumes were for time
this movie was a perfect mix of drama , action and sci-fi fantasy . it is even good without the rest star wars trilogy
the classic and much-imitated story , interesting characters cutting edge effects (at that time) are still impressive effective now because they aren't excessive like in some modern movies (like 5th element) .
this could be the greatest science fiction movie of all time . i think that anyone who hasn't seen it must
great movie . entertaining for many age groups follows a typical archetype use of technology , especially its time (pioneering work)
the best movie ever
nothing comes close in sci-fi movies . classic good vs evil cant wait for the remaining to come out george is da man may force be with you all
this is the best movie ever made ! it was original , yet contained mistakes and mishaps that make all more human . research into myths humans must have been exhausting of time
one of the all-time greatest movies ever made . i was 7 years old when it came out , and it's hard to describe what a huge impact had on my life at time wanted star wars everything : action figures trading cards pillowcases posters you name must have badgered mom take me see movie over 10 times in theater exponentially better than any science fiction that preceeded special effects for thing were shockingly more advanced anything we'd seen before story tapped into powerful myths making resonate with people deeper level most films george lucas big fan joseph campbell (an amazing teacher author field mythology) incorporated lot campbell's ideas hero's journey possibly best tribute is fact still holds up today - 95% other seem so dated watch them now they're joke but endures as classic
star wars was a great movie and had an incredible impact on my generation . who among us hasn't said , may the force be with you or used completed wrapping paper rolls as home-made light-saber in torturing our sibling ? wonderful story effects powerful soundtrack
princess leia is beautiful and the whole movie just great . i think it amazing special effects they did so many years ago
one of the most innovative , just plain fun movies i have ever seen! ! and they didn't need any sex or nude scenes!
you're joking , right ? this movie started a genre of high-quality science fiction films no one has seen since 2001 . eyes popped and jaws dropped seeing it for the first time was an experience i will never forget
star wars is unprecedented in it's time and it rocks! !
i was 4 when star wars came out and my parents took me to see it , have grown up all life loving the trilogy am a fan but revenge of sith is best movie yet if even only for unbelievable effects which why everyone in 1977 went this unbelivable perfect final beginning . p.s love movies praying yoda god pls give us last three you enjoy any then will
brilliant ending to an amazing saga .
this one wrapped everything up just like it was supposed to and then some . sith much better the previous two is as good first three lots of action a few suprises with nice steady pace best movie summer , really !
i thought it was a great 70's movie . good actors and who can forget shelley winters !
i am so sick and tired of all these fake star wars fans trashing this new trilogy if they don't like it keep your mouth shut go watch glitter is the best one out
more 4.51 , than 5 . still satisfying and compelling closure to the star wars sexlogy (is that a word?) action sequences were best of any episode -- particularly light saber duels which rivaled kill bill for quality martial arts skill my only gripe was movie lagged bit during middle i'm not geek but there one technical flaw i noted ; actor playing annakin is tall yet darth vader humongous (in fact in original british bodybuilder dave prowse man suit) come oscar time will academy give george lucas his proper due nominate iii picture (a' la lord rings return king) ?
it set the bar so high took 25 years for a movie to come even close !
such an amazing movie ! far better than episodes 1 and 2 . the plot is very believable , as acting some of scenes were breathtaking.. brilliantly written
damn it ! i just cant understand why critics are so bent upon criticizing this movie and making look like such a disaster (at least the more professional doing so) . to me , there is no better proof of how great than my fellow reviewers comments on sure dialogue not put shakesperean some seems clunky but nonetheless breathtaking spectacle loved was excited even cried during ending made feel child again too bad lucas wasted an entire wasnt able pace dark side turn mind you episode still crap as good gets most all dont what say about haydens portrayal absolutely bought
i just got back from seeing this . it was awesome!!! ! really wasn't crazy about phantom menace and attack of the clones so-so worried that one would be lacking as well , but to my pleasant surprise there a lot great action movie tied together all details episode 4 can't wait watch original star wars again with new perspective thanks for making george!!
i am not a huge star wars fan , but when went to go see revenge of the sith was amazed by all it had offer . special effects along with scenery excellent enjoyed acting very much this movie really dishes out emotions love part where obi wan and anakin are battling at same time yoda evil chancellor fighting as well has ton action gets sad destroys everything so great just one poor decision hes that character you hate
i cry every time shelley dives in .
the best of star wars prequels . hayden christensen did great as anakin who turned evil , killed jedi knights and after a lightsaber duel with obi-wan kenobi on mustafar's lava fields became darth vader many battles special effects sad scenes especially being by clone troopers padme dying she gave birth to luke leia palpatine transforming into emperor was also cool well general grievous
the best star wars yet , and scenery was amazing .
george lucas sent the series out in style.all pieces of puzzle come together.no stones left unturned.while first two were a little lackluster,lucas hit one park with episode 3.lots action,a romance,a touch horror and some shocking moments as well.5 huge stars big thumbs way up !
an absolutely beautiful movie . the directing impresses me to undying end
i think lord of the rings is a great game and it interesting because you get to kill also can fight orcs .
great begining to a trilogy , barlog was very cool !
this movie is a guilty pleasure of mine . saw it first when i was about 12 years old and have never forgotten does some pretty campy dialogue scenes , but at the same time gripping in way that's not easy to forget characters are also memorable seen gain more notoriety recently sense that becoming cult classic something period its status as vanguard disaster movies plus those great shelley winters underwater can see why climb aboard !
so cool !
what can ya say that hasn't already been said about these great epic films.cannot wait for more of peter jackson's works .
the poiseidon adventure unlike many other action films , has an extremly winning soundtrack featuring song morning after . anyways movie is heartpounding and astonishing special effects are amazing it so much better then titanic
great movie . battle scenes are fantastic...amazing story
in my opinion the best of trilogy . there's actually a story to follow rather than just fighting it's great movie , and while long may get old worth seeing
i love when frodo disappeared up the ring !
best of the three by far . absolutely beautiful photography , lovely story and i like that he put arwen on horse in river even though wasn't book
i've said it before and i'll say again . i love what peter jackson has done he's taken an epic book series , turned into 3 absolutly fantastic movies ! he can take made up characters creatures turn them real living walking things only tolkien could create a talking tree or place like the dead marshes this first movie really gives us look inside tolkiens imagination you get to see went on in his mind as was creating these mean aragorn elrond legolas it's all there then through process of races elves who walk snow instead sinking wizards fight each other with staffs huge eye that everything orcs uruk-hai just incredible had do work making come life elijah ,sean billy dom go putting feet ears orlando liv hundreds extra hours makeup- costumes,ears contacs job captures beginning amazing journey not middle earth but time well very next 2 even better
excellent movie . i was a little disappointed on my first viewing , but after giving it second chance realized how great is i'm not sure which lotr movies favorite the trilogy are best of twenty-first century
good , faithful to the spirit of book . several great performances and fine cinematography i actually prefer extended version on video
worth the wait to see hollywood produce an epic that isn't just a bunch of hype but cinematic masterpiece .
i cannot begin to express my utmost disappointment that lord of the rings : fellowship , did not win an academy award for best picture . don't get me wrong a beautiful mind is fantastic film but when you look at battle sequences in tfotr and amazing computer generated characters with such detail smooth movements mention honesty book keeping storyline themes place can't really fault this
peter jackson really knows his stuff . no matter what situation it is , he captures perfectly so refreshing that a movie of this caliber has become such phenomenon
an epic sure to live on ! i don't understand how anyone could criticize this movie . superb acting , scenery sets special effect...it or one of the other two lotr films deserves win oscar-hands down peter jackson is a genius
i never thought peter jackson would be this succesful in bringing book to the big screen
ah , wagner's best-known tune accompanying the air cav on their way in . a brilliant piece of cinema
i was impressed at how faithful the movie to book . noticed that some parts of were left out only learn they on editing room floor after giving it a second thought realized better this way seeing idiots like axlrod2003 can't stay focused for two seconds if people lke him forced endure extra footage would surely drive them suicide
i thought the movie was going to be boring , but it great ! legolas is so hoooottttt!!!
simply put , just a great movie .
great movie , i liked how they incorporated christian concepts into the with out preaching .
great movie . i am a tolkien what love about the book was how detailed it , complex could mopvies capture that no so why try or for matter and hold true instead peter jackson held in different way he to themes story itself emotions places made middle earth is confusing watching can really help clarify too sets music characters looked me correct unlike horrendous animated film (true it's own way) prounounciations are messed up names had celeborn pronounced seleborn wouldn't even dare put amount of elvish such these movies good job there they seemed toc keeping looking should speak little details some which sense only fans did general (especially first one) knowing take out leave making difficult choices all suceeded at balance
excellent movie ! i can't stand fantasy/sci fi movies - but lord of the rings is exception . was hounded to see it for longest time refused because thought would suck finally watched shut him up and couldn't be happier that did i'm a die-hard fan now if you like fellowship you'll love two towers
best movie of the year . it deserved a better showing in academy awards (maybe they're waiting 'til third film we can only hope.)
a near perfect rendering of the book .
i'm a big fan of tolkien . i have read most his books even though they changed some things from the book , this movie was amazing one best movies ever seen
i absolutely love lotr!!! ! know they could have made the movie a lot more like book , but no one not even you are perfect this is best group of ever read and it leaves harry potter in dust by so far! lord rings movie/book series written really wish j.r.r would kept writing them they'd been amazing each time he wrote new .
more than a movie . the sense of journey , transformation for good to evil sane insane is both believable and surreal saw redux version recently loved scene on lost french plantation frenchmans angry passionate description paratroopers knowingly - willingly jumping certain death at dien bien phu only way jumper should die
if i could give decimal ratings , it would be more than a 4.5 but less 5 . this is great movie and sometimes was sad had lots of action have not read any the books though
superlative piece of art .
i love the lord of rings ! while , as stated many other itmes on these pages movies did not stick completely to books it was excelent . loved every aspect enitre movie and two towers well can't wait for third enstallment come out this christmas peter jackson an job portraying true heart story all actors excellent got fotr christams now film is worn if that tells you anything about how good
they could have butchered this film , but i am relieved to find that peter jackson found competant actors bring story life . there are two great things about movie one is ian mckellan's gandalf who absolutely brilliant and was shafted for best supporting actor the other thing suspense fear it created in short did evil right kudos all those involved loved every second
brilliant !
the adaptation from book to film on series appears be a success . first which centered mostly few characters was better accepted by me personally than second introduced us many more creatures and personalities it is my desire see art imitate life so one must wonder there not brown skinned human , elf dwarf or hobbit in whole of middle earth though jr tolkien didn't mention if i remember reading any pigmentation besides that atributed characteristics imaginary races how such epic porportions touch imaginations would made without an afro-american actor obvious site maybe it's suron ruller mordor
see it in the theater , if possible . cinematography is spectacular !
almost as good the book !
this movie is the best of all movies on list . it was absolutely spell-binding and had me glued to my seat as someone who read book , i must say even better than imagined cannot wait for next one coming out in december
a masterpiece . sure , they strayed off the book little (glorfindel anyone?) but overall it was brilliant definitely one of best modern movies in history with excellent scenery (from my home country :)) great effects and characters (the casting perfect) story here's looking forward to next two
stupendous classic the moment it hits screen . gorgeous to look at , wonderfully wrought with such loving care and reverence for literary legend
this is the best movie of century . i love it..everything about it good should have won an oscar..peter jackson aswell well , better luck next time by way : a terrific movie..if you haven't seen yet..then do =)
finally , after waiting much longer than i'd intended i saw fellowship of the ring and was thoroughly impressed . first read trilogy many years ago have it numerous times since doubted that any movie could come even close to magic power books ; however peter jackson has succeeded in being very true tolkien's creation most changes were simply omissions surely no one expected every part book be included a 3-hour although not all cast lives up my own vision characters thought they excellent created their genuine versions played agree with several points made by jays but definitely disagree conclusion he makes update  appreciated for long time annoyed at -- fact enjoyed can hardly wait release two towers
the lord of rings ; fellowship ring is definetly best movie ever made ! i wish could give it a higher rating but can't if there was 1,000,000 would rate with that anyone who doesn't like understand needs to go mental hospital
great movie that lives up to the book it's based upon . those found it slow were probably expecting a typical vietnam , action-packed and not an intelligent philosophical drama
the best movie in world .
this movie is a masterpiece , plain and simple . very beautiful scenery effects well thought-out acted storyline i also like how the doesn't have an actual chapter ending just book main will come at end of third one it's kind different from star wars where they would each it detailed when comes to every character(appearance background) history world role playing (or realm rp however you put it) course itself. if haven't seen go see it!!! !
the best movie in world .
this movie was marvelous . i have always been a fan of tolkien and fantasy as genre when they announced that someone making the fellowship ring into half over-joyed wary what may do to story but after seeing i'm extremely impressed cannot wait until next installment comes out december acting wonderful , characters were exactly should be sets special effects...they just amazing is beautiful in so many ways go see it that's all can say...just
this movie was excellent ! it had great graphics a wonderful plot and the actors were positivly superb
i recently watched the lord of rings ; fellowship ring . also saw cartoon movie version , made in 1976 noticed that although appearances characters was different were pretty much same this proves not all mutilated from books congratulations to peter jackson for choosing his fabulous cast especially orlando bloom fantastic perfomance as legolas elijah wood frodo baggins though character is a little on sweet wimpy side comparison book
i loved the magic of movie especially orlando bloom's portrayal legolas . can't wait for next !
probably the greatest fantasy movie ever filmed . tolkein's magical world is re-created with amazing accuracy , suitable for those who have read his trilogy as well no knowlege of this master writer at all.its themes and ideas embrace best mankind while simultaneosly showing corrosive effect evil on story's antagnonists.i envy have't already seen film : what a wonderful treat awaits them
wow , what a cinematic triumph and an artistic marvel  ! such great footage close-ups the make-up unbelievable especially frodo with his cute nose no wonder this masterpiece of big screen claimed all those prestigious awards at oscars . customs dialogue were so inspiring to me that even though i've read book dozens times already had go back some passages over again (even if i can't take magic mushrooms same time anymore) think my all-time favorite part story is when cave troll chases around rock only wish we could see magnificient creature in two towers (maybe he turns into treebeard after first being crazed by supernatural whispers ring ?) another truly classic episode bridge khazad-dum collapses there movie really captured essence tolkien's epic text will admit one thing which did bug bit about was poetry just too long-winded confusing poems kings recrowned broken blades renewed they unnecessary plot peter jackson showed genius editing them out
when the movie first came out i was skeptical about seeing it , read books younger and wasn't that interested in those type of stories . but after watching definitely has changed my opinion awesome effects were great can't wait to see next 2 films
can't say enough about this beautiful piece of film so i'll just . greatest ive ever seen
iut is great
i love the book , story and finally movie (tfotr) . my father was an exellent storyteller this first only he told to us (three of us) it a christmas gift what ! has now completed dreams imaginations would have loved share with visual senses then as child not ment replace your own imagination nor will if you're true fan but should fill gap for most hope everyone learns something from go out enjoy movie(s) friends family...peace
the novie had great action throughtout almost whole thing . it effects and they picked good actors for parts i really like job did not stick entirly to book but what movie does? ? would be too hard recreate a much long have read books are captures main of though mines moria peter jackson make out recommened this anyone who likes , adventure romance horror has all essentials
i only really found two problems with the movie . one they made arwen seem like a main character , and is that left out part tom bombadil other than thing could see wrong some parts or changed but to be expected of any after book thought costumes people who chose for characters were very good did follow basic plot line
i can't honestly say that i'm really much of a tolkien fan , but have read the books . and see value in them... yeah they were good was waiting with baited breath for movie to come out wasn't there on opening night.....i kinda think when went it maybe 3 people theater had actually book....i wanted so dislike this pick apart details find be angry over every discrepancy between book couldn't do sitting watching help incredibly well done will grant didn't follow 100% more important thing (and amazing thing) is did spirit any idiot can write or direct act just goes straight down what's book.....but brilliantly directed thought actors an incredible job am extremely glad as such because you let fans decide what be--you never make everyone happy five stars wait other two movies
taking the risk of making someone angry , i have to say that prefer movie book - maybe because saw first- but thought was a bit boring . finally read all 3 books and my favourite is last one as for fellowship ring really liked it cast location ( new zealand amazing!) adaptation story s very good pure magic entertainment
yes , this movie does in fact beat the godfather (maybe not ii but definitely i . will spare all embarrsassment and deftly skip over sack of skittles known as iii) what plot thread jumps ? my wife who never read books thought it was most intriguing developed she had seen on film years citizen kane is jumpy if ever there one agree with first comments : lotr better than incidentally star wars also acting more refined deeper relationships are touching while i'm throwing gas a fire may well add that raging bull crouching tiger hidden dragon sophie's choice titanic gone wind wizard oz bicycle thief il postino cinema paradiso three die hards
what ! there is no way this movie can beat the godfather , or citizen kane (as someone here was claiming.) character development weak and plot thread jumpy difficult to follow . i would have been lost had not remembered parts of book from reading it as a kid move star wars ? howfrigginever loved me gripping seat for 3 hours just glad didnt turn into melodramatic horse sh*t like titanic other 'epics' cinematography great sfx tops makeup costume were fantastic good movie-making platform actors that being said wish marry liv tyler she sooooo beautiful anyone know her
i have seen a recent poll that has compared lord of the rings with godfather , citizen kane and other great movies . this was amazing because top 100 all time #1 out those movie sceanry you wide awake 100% won afl's best film year is rated for golden globes should win picture income passing harry potter people who hav loved it if havent see now
i thought this was a simply awesomely fantastic movie . thouht it exciting , scary mysterious romantic thrilling and intriguing made me upset at the end cause wanted to see more have wait year for next one come out can definetly myself buying entire series in few years once they all on screen hardly till my new favorite will be hard top
i didn't think it could be done , but peter jackson absolutely nailed . he captured the spirit of world tolkien in a way that was respectful book not handcuffed by told story fellowship ring deserved to - with excellent characters / actors plenty allusions saga's history and breathtaking special effects this movie epic its visuals storyline execution would recommend anyone fans first timers alike like so many others on board am going have hard time waiting year for next one !
a good film needs actors and great story . just like this one :) it took them 5 years to finish , peter jackson is brilliant ! i read the guide book says he has filmed every single detail from (almost remember its huge book) atmosphere .. so forth
as a kid i really enjoyed reading fantasy/sci-fi novels and playing games like dungeons dragons , so i'm predisposed to be fan of well-done lord the rings movie . this is extremely some other comments here complain that not 100% true book an accusation but also unfair there's no way pack entire into single make few changes for sake story-telling reviewers have already mentioned peter jackson (the movie's director) somehow manages necessary while staying spirit first in long time has just blown me away with near-perfect combination story acting directing special effects film captures conveys horror evil menace dark forces well honestly found myself gritting my teeth during many scenes - ringwraiths attacking orcs working underground forge journey through mines.. at end 3-hour wishing there was more wondering how going wait another year see second part trilogy
as one who has read the lord of rings some twenty times and now finds it hard to recapture spell this story once held , film brought tale back life in a way far surpassing all expectations . given that novel become (to at least) an emerging european mythology having several archetypal elements common with ancient sagas (including sense history many original proper names languages profound psychological insights) screen adaptation could have failed innumerable ways nonetheless peter jackson's ; fellowship ring succeeded capturing essential qualities remarkable while i miss northerliness (as c s lewis describes it) landscapes depicted was agreeably surprised by highly surrealistic tone maintained throughout - enhanced raw new zealand landscape sombre music demonic black riders angelic elves not least sheer momentum screenplay which hurtles viewer along breakneck speed surrealism lends support central psychodrama movie : frodo's mental struggles power near psychotic sequences when he wears is therefore half-in spirit world palpable courage demonstrate apparently hopeless quest (after tradition vertigo mirage) cinematic modalities revived actually surpasses book bringing mortal danger company draws nearer mordor their sincere display companionship love true remains core theme despite special effects action epic saga proportions ben hur or bible unfolds on final analysis character developments contributed much success frodo (played elijah wood) most memorable me since my image him from rather indistinct pale complexion dark hair sensitive thoughtful these were canonical depictions but expressive vulnerable looks (enhanced his being down hobbit size) voice slightly hypnotic gaze wood brings confirmed latent had always hero except perhaps for youthfulness (in older than other hobbits though aging been arrested ring) are compatible tolkien's there venerable performances especially sean bean's (boromir) ian mckellan's (gandalf) christopher lee (saruman) viggo mortenson cate blanchett both seemed little light portray characters aragorn galadrial (not share view) hugo weaving did agree conception elrond soberness portrayal grew accounts orlando bloom john rhys-davies give convincing portrayals legolas elf gimli dwarf astin dominic monaghan billy boyd altogether charming apocryphal material (liv tyler's arwen replacing glorfindel aragorn's allowing depart alone etc.) bother omissions consequent missed opportunities any living myth variations develop over time until more pure distillation underlying archetypes achieved must say changes necessitated medium dialogue bree needed example describing better detail ( they will come you...in place where no help do you wish them find ? terrible ! ) would helped explain hobbits' close escapes if we informed book) nazgul perceive physical sharply clearly just does wearing instead weapons fear despair another amon hen (seat seeing) glimpse minas tirith followed flash-back gandalf (or voice-over) telling take off fool nearly revealed eye valuable foreshadowing two towers extra spent easily taken out lengthy scenes hideous uruk-hai cave troll forget reforge narsil (the sword broken) bring later musical score effective unobtrusive yet places free dramatic accompanies although liked melodic (perhaps forthcoming sequels) definitely passages mines moria well haunting modal lament bears repeated viewing density be appreciated first wasn't till fourth noticed three stone trolls bilbo's adventure glade how balrog passage bridge kazad dum (leaping flame-filled gulch after path blocked ruin endless stair found costumes endlessly varying impeccable fashion trend should emerge capes brooches waistcoats etc saturation red green blue hues print also delightful reminiscent films '50s early '60s sequels similar scope released next years motion pictures ever greater impetus establishment global psychologists sociologists note witnessing formation entirely mythic system undoubtedly outlast our themes preservation beauty against depersonalized mechanical control industry technology sorely today even precious generations
i know everybody has been breathlessly awaiting my opinion , hahaha so here it is . never read these books though i'm familiar with the story from animated films i'd watch in lower school library while cutting class tried reading 'the hobbit' once but thought writing was cornball- a wizard showing up randomly at somebody's house and telling them he needs help for an adventure he's arranging.. aren't adventures messy business?.. blah point cared about characters lot all of actors were superb without fail effects weren't hoped they'd be when elf jumps on troll's back mine one exactly mirrors scene harry potter even fx-wise peter jackson director jumped cgi bandwagon just as morphing made 'heavenly creatures' after t2 came out god have nothing against state-of-the-art fx some styles are better than others directors should use according to mood they're trying create not because they most real  fools me ; it's always 2-d lighting works.. looks like liquid world ice didn't think ian mckellan had what took play gandalf- too harmless- kicked ass elijah wood especially good guy who plays aragorn aragorn's player tries hard facial stuff during film make himself present by end definitely earned his future kingdom christopher lee still genius was- you really hate guts movie totally manipulates -and glad this sw2 finally getting roles worthy him set earth or new zealand- its own went afterwards couldn't stop thinking want talk either very happily stunned going see many times
truly spectacular . i'm not one of these tolkien fanatics that knows the whole story , so this movie was kind a first for me cast excellent and you develop respect each member fellowship many villains are somewhat atypical bad-guys but it all fits in well frodo gang fighting something much more powerful than they would be expected to handle is unsettling watch it's an epic special effects breathtaking just so.. colossal wouldn't stretch say greatest film ever grace my eyes ears i've never encountered quite like can't wait next !
the movie was incredible , peter jackson did a amazing job.my favourite characters in had to be hobbits (their so cute and funny!) also legolas . made me feel as though i middle earth which happens where live ! (wellington new zealand) can't wait see next trilogy this series all actors put up an preformance esspecially elijah wood well done peter......a definite 10 out of for that
i really love this movie . the scenery was spectacular , even though it filmed in my country horse part of film and think its cool to have a for myself great job peter
i can't possibly write everything that want too because it would take up about three pages . but i'll give a try have been saying for months this will be the greatest movie ever , it's thousand times better than thought granted there are some changes from book is understandable saw fellowship of ring opening day first showing course and seen five since plan on seeing many more every actor/actress was absolutely amazing 100% true to they all deserve an oscar breathtaking laughed cried frightened felt emotions sheer perfection no words can describe how wonerful really my favorite characters were frodo baggins(elijah wood) samwise gamgee(sean astin) meridoc brandybuck(dominic monaghan) last not least perigrin took(billy boyd) hobbiton so detail unbeleivable cannot pick scene great i'm going insane waiting two towers come out one year seems like eternity away read books 10 sure j.r.r tolkien extreamly proud peter jackson directing time
i have been a tolkein fan for many , years . you could say that his writings truly had effect on my early so when heard they were making this set of movies was somewhat concerned what would come it the first thing most people ask me is : did stick to book no but true peter jackson something not thought of....he told same story from new perspective instead backtracking and flashbacks like books mr has forward in chronological order telling familiar exciting way being faithful never walked out movie with feeling ; even replaced matrix incredible....and wasn't nearly long enough!! ! there only one seen wish included feel secure taking 12 year old are calling orcs earth womb  well think she nightmares month expertly done bit foul language gory/bloody moving experience
awesome movie ! amazing special effects , creating a whole new world . will see again on the big screen can't wait for next one
brilliantly written , acted and directed . i think this is one the best movies made in last decade let alone action
i think its the best star wars movie besides episode 3
my number 4 out of the 6,behind star wars,episode 3 and empire strikes back,but equally good in its own right .
it's always a battle between this and empire for being the second best star wars . also had an excellent score amazing special effects like other two it has wonderful end to trilogy plus those ewoks are amusing explosion of death is incredible absolute triumph in film history got love !
i loved it . the best one yet had a well planed plot to
i love the teddys !
the return of jedi is miles in front empire strikes back and a little better than first since story gets interesting more quickly . it's recent (set earlier) additions to
my favorite out of the first 3 . luke meets his dad face to , such a touching story at end princess lea exposes herself little in this one mmmmmm ahead it's time and very complete entertaining
again another sequel . i've seen them all about a million times i love of they rock.i must say though that this is think , the best one not because it;s newest trilogy but story line very well done guess every movie rate deserves it
this film was the perfect close to most explosive trilogy in history . of three origional films , one is definately my favorite for a number reasons battle scenes were wonderful and special effects as be expected coming from george lucas absolutely breathtaking everything seemed come into place with death yoda subsequent darth vader i enjoyed last 30 minutes espescially final scene between luke thought that having save his son by killing emperor way solidify old saying- blood thicker than water at least how interprited it opinion best entire closure btw ewoks are awesome !
the return of jedi is underrated , relative to its predecessors . movie as a last trilogy perfect ending masterful story musical score impeccable next godfather ii it deserves 5
there is so much that's cool about this movie that i will only mention a few things . first , really enjoyed the dynamic between silence and loudness in film during freeway shootout gunshots were incredibly loud as they are real life not these little pops come from most movie-guns when you have an assault rifle firing away for minutes at time probably be deaf while ear made whole thing more realistic yet surreal same also showdown airport pacino chasing deniro through transformers had lot of noise it would totally dark quiet creeping night periodically plane fly over theater filled with incredible light then fade again one my favourite movies stars two greatest crime-drama actors history if haven't seen you'd better damn good excuse like maybe you've been living monastery tibet past seven years even shame on
i think this one is the best out of all other star wars . it has everything : cool fight scenes , good story special effects chewbacca ewoks...
another great star wars movie!! ! loved the ewoks
this movies timing was perfect i in my early teen years and able to understand the somwhat deeper themes of film . (redemption , forgivness,family) after empire would be number two for me sum it up guess there are three things that most memorable about jedi : 1 lapti nek song from jabba's band(still prefer over sp.ed music) 2.carrie fisher(still have a crush on her day.)3.the scene where anakin returns saves his son own life few scenes can choke even today
pesky ewoks notwithstanding , this is still one fine movie . it ties up all the story threads from first two to make a perfect type ending of course special effects are superb but unlike many movies since they don't drown enhance and those who think just another sci-fi totally wrong about family battle good evil/right also redemption coming age climactic between vader luke my time favorite scenes
the best movie of original trilogy , rotj features a second death star and huge battle to destroy it between two fleets . meanwhile on planet with an amusing race aliens called ewoks han leia work sabotage shield generator protecting said also look for jabba hutt emperor darth vader much more in this exciting great !
my favorite movie of all time , bar-none . i love the trilogy and this film in opinion is greatest whole jabba's palace scene battle on endor huge space climactic emperor's throne room - has it concludes itself well fantastic proving to be a tale power good ultimately redemption
george lucas has outdone himself with the final movie of star wars trilogy . this shows that force a way balancing good and evil i liked story , props setting used in technology concepts revealing jabba hut was unforgettable true glory revolution efforts one jedi can show we are never limited any our dreams
man , princess leia was hot in that outfit . i wish had powers like luke sky walker the things would do with mind control also light saber is a true weapon hope to make one soon or somebody else does
return of the jedi , is in my opinion best star wars original trilogy . all action suspense atmosphere just right george lucas can make movies and well there are many reasons to see movie such as emperor has a larger part war ends rebels defeat empire too list han gets freed jabba dies death blows up digitally remastered version makes even better than it already this must
a classic tale of light against darkness , and how always wins . very timeless movie that has lasted through two generations
i really enjoyed this movie because thought that the creator was very creative . impressed with all characters and places he of also liked storyline
i saw this when it first came out and didn't really appreciate - but was 16 . then decided to buy on video god am glad that did has a tremendous cast as told by antondatree (he forgot natalie portman though) you do have sit down concentrate film otherwise won't get whats happening loved the music running in background found moby 'god moving over waters' is very powerful fim two main actors are best industry its fabulous
if lucas weren't making the other six movies , ever this would be fitting end to best trilogy in existence . fulfills jungian archetypes and leaves a sense of hope for humanity intelligent species
excellent sequel.. .
the best movie ever but i believe sam should get all of credit because he always gets frodo out trouble and does nothing walk around with a ring .
probably my most favorite of the trilogy . it had too many endings though lol as always , liv is simply beautiful and vigo has talent
i felt that having a director was great fan of tolkein made the movie . also each actor protrayed charactor very well
it was awsome , but my fav is still two towers .
couldn't get any better !
set it back 500 years and this is the stuff of shakespeare . detailed story neil mccauley (robert deniro) , trying to run a robbery while dealing with psychopath who was once in his gang vincent hanna (al pacino) cop will do anything stop him by far michael mann's best film complicated so many details stories powerhouse not mention cast ! deniro pacino val kilmer jon voight ashley judd - if you haven't seen can't call yourself movie fan whole pulls has bank scene i've see heat now summary : that
what else can be said ? the final chapter in a triumph of epic film making , 5 stars .
no words . i can't describe it wait , yes can.. the acting was incredible but far surpassing even charms of orlando bloom is majesty special effects editing seamless and absolutely astounding entire trilogy breathtaking this one takes cake first 4 times that saw bawled yeah i'm a fan
all of the rings pictures were great but they pulled out stops on this one . some times trilogies don't come together in end is a classic so it had to be good i have read hobbit and silmirilion (sp) (twice) you can't do any better than tolken movie deserves accolades receives then script locations directing cinemetography , editing go who says make them like used
great movie and riveting as all other installements in the series...highly recommend it...i mean i am not someone that likes this sort of genre but couldn't be torn away once watched first one.. .
great end of a trilogy . plenty fighting easily the best although by now idea is unoriginal
the best lotr so far ! absolutely brilliant it's peter jackson's croening achievment . any who rated this lower than five stars can go to hell
one of the top five "good bad" movies ever made . starts mysteriously , and ends same way certainly kurt russell's better-known roles (which he may only sheepishly acknowledge) playing fun-loving hard-charging long-haul trucker jack burton better than anyone else could've (although you'd swear was channeling john wayne from first frame) carpenter given chance to do something unique succeeded on all fronts with this picture ; lots action intrigue comedy special effects an unknown (in america anyway) line-up international martial artists at their best mr david lo pan might just be all-time villains (with egg shen his "sherlock") sprinkle in kim cattrall (at her cattrall-iest) as jack's confounding love interest is that can't miss not exactly tolstoy but it doesn't pretend anything other what : a fast-and-furious detour through maze mystic mayhem !
not as good the two towers but still an amazing movies . i was so sad at end , knowing there wouldn't be a fourth movie lord of rings trilogy will always rememberred
the lord of rings has been a great experience for lot people , some didn't enjoy movies . that's okay i can live with that but those us who love tolkien nothing will ever come close to whole seeing these films and sharing time our friends also them my greatest memories are trotk day it opened 2 good so ending was little long.. everything about is huge you can't spend ten hours watching have minute wouldn't be fair storyteller
froda and sam hardly ever fight any thing , they go on a big safari draging bald kate moss with no make up along them . can barely it the mountain cause frodo keeps passing out like he's got dodgy red lobster wanting to come yet these two seem be ultimate heros real are others left deal all iraqi insurgents prehistoric elephants food for thought
despite the long ending , this was awesome . i guess he had to tie up all of lose ends but wasn't as good thought that peter could do
a low end scale 5.. . very good movie , but the ending could of used to be shorter (come on it would've been easy) also every time i think this is my fav lotr by far get reminded how cool two towers and well edited only reason (and few other eliments) bugs me so much because rest damn awesome.. i'm just nit picking cause there's not there like
the entire lord of rings trilogy is just so amazing that it's hard to describe . but return king , *impossible* ! this movie something grand behold from start finish costumes sweeping camera lush landscapes everything superb although what really makes characters we've watched them through long journey and now here it .. ultimatly becomes our beloved heartfelt moving i must have cried 15 times throughout! an beautiful cast actors actresses very good feels like less a more magic or as they say :)
epic , archetypal perfect in keeping with the power drama and message of original writings . combine all that superior acting special effects attention to detail this is best since star wars i have seen other attempts at making these books into movies they fell far short what imagined when read them but series.. better than remembered every way inspirational heart warming hopeful more could you ask for!! !
great story,great graphics,great acting,and battle scenes . this movie is destined to be a classic
i always did like lo-pan . can really identify with his thing for girls green eyes
amazing trilogy and this third one is really lovely....great tolkien great jackson
it's pretty much impossible to not like any of these movies . people complain about how long it is , but i think that just makes better
just a wonderful , masterpiece ! one of my all time top 10 .
i love it ! especially when the fat one went up ring
it is a great movie on it's own , but the climax of maybe best trilogy put film . very deserving picture award
wonderful ending when...i won't spoil it . i like how wrapped up , almost cried
i've always thought that all fantasy movies were stupid & a waste of time to watch . but since the lord rings developed greater respect liking toward those type this last was best ever!!!!!!! ! it deserved oscars go new zealand!
lo-pan is my hero . as jack burton i love this movie so much if you like aod or laughing in general , you'll
supeiorly awesome!!!!! ! i saw it 2 days after came out , but do have to agree with the bad ending . why did they show sam and his dumn,happily lived ever thing dont know what people are saying about shire being attacked by sarumon thought death (or collapse) of sauron,it would killed all evil anyways rules!!!
wonderful ending to a saga . can't wait till it is released on dvd!!!!! !
after seeing the first two lord of rings , i was interested in final chapter story . found this to be best part trilogy film deserves every award it recieves peter jackson is a brilliant director highly reccommend
this is easily the best movie of 2003 , a great way to end trilogy and it deserves win oscar for picture .
another one of my favourite films from last year . peter jackson please take a bow for delivering the greatest three cinematic all time lord rings trilogies are going to be remembered many years come where some fail make third or second part their sequels deliver , equally delivered they excited audiences and most importantly remained true book
the best movie of trilogy ! amazingly , after terribly boring fellowship series bounced back with a vengenance two towers and now this incredible action sequences great dialogue even some inspired humor . multiple endings are awesome inspire strong emotions
pure and simple : a masterpiece .
totally superb . filmmaking at its best this movie deserves the oscar for picture of year anyone who thinks boring have no good taste
what is this , two girls with green eyes? ! i will marry them both shut up mista burton son of a bitch must pay indeed ooh mao yin need you the guys just stands there waiting for me to drive my truck straight through him light coming out his mouth leave jack alone he showed great courage .
as i prepare to write a review for the final installment of lord rings , have feel like am ripping off band-aid leaving old friends behind . because in effect characters become our these past three years they began with an innocence fresh pre-9/11 days and ended true world that is free young but still bit cynical wary went into theater high expectations left those well-met was impressed by raw emotion injected story -- especially moving performance given billy boyd peregrine took his eyes when he separated from best friend merry ; pain fear shown so poignantly face battle open inquisitiveness child presence gandalf all made my heart ache sting pippin becomes different kind hero one who courageous yet naive strong-willed childlike retains ingenuousness even ages knowledge may never see shire again startling paradox sean astin also has some very moments samwise gamgee nothing short extraordinary lines actions would been difficult or over-the-top actor lesser caliber makes sam rather than just trusting sidekick talent phenomenal viggo mortensen aragorn born be there particular tribute hobbit heroes cannot described any words vocabulary it simply seen believed fully experienced scene punctuated soundtrack composed howard shore making most unforgettable goosebump movie time this film straightforward about hope friendship courage between good evil course triumphs end hearts are warmed minds set at ease it's too bad real life can't always tolkein novel jackson
before i saw the return of king , my favourite trilogy was fellowship ring . it had granduer a sense foreboding and light relief to help balance melancholy tone two towers felt lacked certain something hard going but this suspect is because middle film which always be hardest portray wasn't sure how they would end all could either complete flop or piece cinema history well rotk exceeded expectations more ! pace fast battle scenes exciting what made for me very real true friendship between frodo sam cried with lump in throat when sobbed at frodo's rejection tears rolled down cheeks heart swelled said can't carry can you as he slung exhausted over his shoulder defy anyone not weep that scene sit through 9 whole hours lord rings just see again brilliant only hope elijah wood sean astin recieve recognition deserve rest cast aragorn splendid eowyn convincingly courageous (her slaying fell beast witch stunning) gimli legolas most their short screen time faramir an extremely sympathetic character merry pippin developed so than mere comic giant spider shelob terrifying horror showed peter jackson's genre roots there one fault here wholeheartedly agree missmellie voiceover from galadriel who began longer have tied up loose ends succinctly been done ten minutes final ship sailing grey havens far satisfying ending seeing worthy main protagonist shutting door hobbit-hole first watched didn't want second ending's numerous farewells grated on story already pathos did need sentimentality added feels shame nitpick thing congratulations jackson members everyone associated production making trips worthwhile
fantastic!!!!!i am waiting for more movies like this one
this is truly a masterpiece of movie . it has the grandeur , thrills excitement blockbuster ; and yet beauty heart an independent film great thing about unlike other famous trilogies return king can stand on its own so fabulous that you don't have to watched previous two or even be lord rings fan appreciate ian mckellen as gandalf sean astin samwise gave outstanding performances ! peter jackson completed his with vision talent hopefully academy will grace fantastic some gold statues i recommend everyone
absolutely brilliant...a stunning conclusion to a amazing trilogy . i never wanted it end that is the highest compliment can give this movie me , hero samwise gamgee and sean astin gives an oscar-calibur performance only hope academy sees fit him his due rare for film enrapture me...and one has was worth staying up till 4:00am ! will see again am sure yes proudly lotr geek do have add agree with ninja squirrel billy boyd's spectacular too what talented singer musician also thought david wenham able infuse faramir such pathos...something difficult short on screen time still feel having seen rotk second gave most outstanding sam could been rather cardboard cutout but he turned into three-dimensional character...taking from gardener of plot if had not frodo would gotten mount doom like gandalf galadriel resist pull ring pass test...something none others who access were score higher than 5 good conquered evil did so because least ones loved how peter jackson showed at preferred epilogue (perhaps voice over) telling became members fellowship...but regardless ended quietly as peace should be
best movie ever!!!!!!! ! if you dont see this suck
you won't be disappointed . in fact , i believe this movie far exceeded my expectations a perfect ending to the lord of rings trilogy return king excellent performances almost-flawless cg and breathless cinematography complement epic story beautifully like others it's long so it probably wouldn't good idea buy super-mega-value-sized drink for (note : following may contain spoilers ; if don't wanna know stop reading here.) segment that showed evolution smeagol/gollum was great introduction being as didn't read book particularly enjoyed eowyn's role installment--after seeing second think she'd really come into play battles though quite compare movie's were absolutely difficult find flaws an absolute work art books yet have any comparison between novels movies review is based solely on movie.)
a excellently produced closer to possibly the greatest movie trilogy ever exist . just like first two , return of king has all around great acting beautiful scenery one best adaptation screenplays written and a+ editing this is entire that was meant be seen on big screen
i saw it the second day came out in theaters . which was yesterday is an awesome movie ! seriously you have to see battle scenes are amazing all graphics story cool legolas best!
brilliant ! a magnificently beautiful film .
the final chapter of peter jackson's lord rings movie trilogy is best , taking as it does all storylines that were sere set up and developed in first two tying them tolkien-esque fashion . some viewers may not care for last twenty/thirty minutes jackson plays out post-war endings each major characters but his decision fitting : we've spent too much time with these to end a simple it's over ! exception gentleman who played denethor acting been series players has given more do they have stepped met challenge this finest motion picture 2003
this is indeed peter's crowning accomplishment , jrr would be proud ! the cinematography superb cast outstanding scenery marvelous special effects are awesome and gathering of three different paths in story line perfect . following lineage kings/stewards was accurate poignant other two lines hobbiton folk filled with anxiety drama course warmth going into theater i concerned that a 3:20 movie might take its toll quite pleased didnt even notice time cant wait for 5 hour box set
great cheesy fun film ! check your brain at the door and enjoy
the battle at helms deep was amazing !
it rocked ! war scenes were cool
this was the best of lot ; course , i like battle scenes .
my personal favorite in the trilogy .
i think this was an amazing movie . the best lord of rings ever huge battle just breathtaking , i've neven seen anything like that before peter jackson left a legacy and could watch every day one my all time favorite
the best of lotr trilogy . it was most exciting and didn't feel too long like others plus battle scenes were an absolute joy to watch !
probably the best of 3 films , i really love it . its amazing how tolkien created such characters
of all the lotr movies , i wouold have to say this one is my favorite . if can sit through 5 times and not get tired it you know must love it's just because orlando's eye shot closeup in fangorn forest although that did keep me on edge seat for about minutes afterwards.( was when obsessed with him which i'm anymore by way) definetly has best battle scene batle at helms deep amazingly crafted took them a long time build set think they said 7 months then gets destroyed ! talk hard work gone before your eyes but worth 2 lines from 1st legolas talking gimli he can't see gimliwhat's happening ? legolasshall describe or would like find box? second again their fighting orcs such leoglas two already 17 argh i'll no pointy ear outscoring legolas19 hilarious ya die-hard fan
a mind-blowing experience . the extended edition of two towers is worth every penny.one greatest sequels ever made
orlando bloom stole the show and made me jump out of my seat cheer when he slid down stairs while firing off arrows at hapless orc then proceeded to separate some heads from bodies reached bottom . this film only betters formula established in first gollum is a top notch performance that character lauch tremble even feel sorry for him was brilliant i hope trend continues into third
this film is fantastic ! it betters the first one which hardly possible . actors are magnificent and special effects in battle scenes worth taking many double takes a trumph for film-making even if fudges on tolkien's version little
i loved the battle at helm's deep and part where ents attack isengard .
once i saw the fellowship , couldn't wait for two towers to come out . and only bad thing about is it makes that much harder return of king one very best movies all time you just don't know what you're missing until you've been a part lord rings !
forget the special effects....awesome characters.....believable . story line....unforgetable remember only this... this is a great movie that will touch , motivate and inspire two it was leave you lusting to see sequel one of best hollywood has offer
never read the books but i'm in love with this movie series .
masterful movie - the acting is top notch and cinematography spectacular'
i loved this movie , even more than the first one . it is fun trying to spot friends in and odd famous person have met good know that level of achievement can come out my school great
action , mystery comedy all wrapped into one . i consider this a classic
the scenery special effects are awesome . can't wait for third
enjoyed this even more than the first which was excellent . thrilled to see our h.s aged children fascinated though they have never read book like their mom did (many years ago!)
don't get me wrong , chicago was fine . but lets real academy lotr the two towers best picture of year hands down now i'm not one these fanatics and i actually thought first could have been a little shorter 2nd has more action excitement it flows better gullom-smiegel is lot fun to watch whole movie true cinematic masterpiece will say that from reading bit some comments here people psycho-analyzing film extreme another person calling christian harry potter anti-christian need remember its just science fiction take so seriously ! chill out folks however fantastic no question
this movie deserves a word which i do not apply lightly : masterpiece . if could give it more stars , would is perfect film-making one frame dull each of it's 181 minutes enthralling everyone find something to enjoy
the book on which three films are based is conventionally , and incorrectly referred to as a trilogy ...a term that describes books related but each complete work in itself--able stand independently of others . lord rings actually single novel divided into parts by publisher for reasons convenience critics who call two towers sequel mistaken it part best judged such anticipating similar quality level as-yet-unseen third intalment excellent jackson's emendations were large more respectful than anyone has right expect given film industry's historically rocky relationship literature especially great
i haven't seen a more visually astounding film yet with the possible exception of fellowship ring .
does anyone really think that chicago is even in the same league as this masterpiece ? f'n sad . one of best 3 or so hours i ever spent.. except party where met chi.. never mind
i think the movie speaks for itself .
best movie ever , way better than titanic or spiderman and rotk will rule dec . 2003!!!! !
please note that i am rating this on the basis of it being a seperate entity from book ; have not read yet , and will refrain doing so until after watched third installment series . is understood movie strayed away book's storyline bit if you cannot handle highly suggest do watch as many my die-hard lotr fans left disappointed could see through their preconceptions alright said was an absolute work art ! cinematography breathtaking well done computer graphics enhanced story rather than masked something current movies accomplish gollum incredible technology--almost completely believable (the best i've seen far) captivating characters are rich alive may to twice get past eye candy-ness all (and but oh beautifully) words caution : 1) can't sit still for three hours might want stay 2) don't order super-giant-mega-zized drink at theater--you probably won't up go bathroom long time full bladder 3) like fantasy 4) fan stand anything straying save yourself heart attack 5) everyone has sake friends who haven't giving parts or be much less enjoyable them
this is without a doubt my all-time favourite film (at least until return of the king released) . peter jackson took more liberty with story in chapter , but heart still very evident and movie flows perfectly cgi effects particularly gollum treebeard were astounding competely believable i was also really impressed how weta digital used their operation massive program to create huge scale battle helm's deep acting performances note perfect as well...and viggo mortensen he's truly an old fashioned matinee hero who just crackles charisma john-rhys daveys brilliant bringing comic relieg screen through gimli...and well provided voice for only possible contention have witht way which faramir's character adapted from book much harsher seems lose beautiful peaceful wisdom that he had however his role did need be adjusted allow proper climax guess we'll wait see develops conlusion trilogy
an action-packed , special effects-packed sword and sorcery epic ! even better then the first movie
amazing ! that's all i have to say...amazing
this movie is only slightly better than the first . it was a little boring , being 3 hours long however parts of were good like smegol talking at end and made me laugh when kept showing tree carrying merry pippin
best film ive ever seen !
this was truely better by far than the first film (fotr) , and i ve (only) seen it three time (till now) . shows every character just as much an other gollum made brilliant sometimes one can t even tell to a 100% that he is animated for instance tried struggle sam steal ring from frodo really rellay worth watchin (at least two times incase you didn get hang of time) best ever.!
it is out now ! i'm not hobbit cultist and i thought was amazing best movie of the year .
despite some huge book-related errors (elves at helm's deep , faramir etc) this is a great movie . i haven't decided whether it's better than the first but it truly masterpiece contains both best introduction to any film i've seen and battle may not be 100% accurate as far book translation goes warranted brilliantly entertaining has little bit of everything must see bring on third
so many people have done an extensive analysis of the movie , that i will refrain . just say it is dark threatening and there are long moments in which one suddenly realizes has forgotten to breathe for a while even on 6th showing yes variations from book - bothers me as die hard tolkein fan (one who read series once year since 70's average) but never before seen 6 times nuff said ?
i waited to see this film for a whole year , and the director peter jackson really made wait worth its while ! so far we've seen how ring was found now we go on journeys battles of our (now broken)fellowship . film,as expected did not include evrything from novel but what it miss out replaced by breath taking landscapes new special effects best part revealing gollum character generated cgi depicted just as would have imagined whilst reading books.the voice looks good that you believe ther creature like battle sceens were created well casting costumes perfect only thing didnt seem right movie ended does leave alot next movie...i cant p.jackson is going make lotr instalment even better!!
brilliant !
unbelievably good !
best movie ever ?
a first class movie , faithful enough to the tolkien writing capture essence of book yet with some slight changes that make keep it's momentum . battle scenes and good/evil conflict are right on i highly recommend it
i like orlando oops forgot his last name he plays leggouses don't know how to spell that thogh
exelent . a very good free version of the origial sometimes i got stucked because didn`t expect it to be such different , but peter jackson did an job and so all actors actress can`t wait see third one !
the special effects were amazing ! i liked first one better , but this still deserves a five
i don't understand those people who call fans of this series obsessed or nerds  . never even thought tolkein before all wasn't into the cartoon version his stories when was little in fact , forced by a seventh grade english teacher to pick up hobbit but something clicked me saw fellowship last year really liked fantasy because couldn't grasp them they just didn't seem real well is real--or at least it seems that way characters are believable and lovable comedic moments perfectly timed action kind where you gasp squirm theater seats movie fantastic deserves every cent earns
a great film , but not quite to the level of first in trilogy . jackson had take liberties with scene sequence book and result was i just never got chance settle at any one place long enough most glaring difference music fotr closing song as credits rolled painful hear---the truly bad decision has made since he started these films glossed over fact that elrond is halfelven his brother chose mortal life many millenia before arwen can choose surrender her immortality more time should have been spent ents like quickbeam less creating scenes aragorn pitching cliff warg this obviously spliced give weight passion developing heart maiden rohan for isildur's heir guess am being spoiled my assessment movie so good expected second be much better empire strikes back than star wars disappointed stiill deserves five stars hopefully return king meets every excpectation
just like the first one , second is a masterpiece . it has all : great acting luscious landscapes well writen plot (you can't go wrong with possibly greatest books ever written) flow of movie what more could you want ? t's also interesting to know that their saving last part book for third i better see an oscar nod best picture year run theaters gaurantee will this again and etc. etc
remarkable in it's pacing and visually stunning , this bridge from fotr to the king's return is nothing short of spectacular . fans story may lurch a little regarding changes but pj has done an admirable job balancing his love for genius making movie fly gollum...well what can i say ? he lives ! incredible cgfx gollum helms deep ents...this very rich banquet...enjoy it more than once
even better than the first one ; darkness and violence of second book is really well reflected in film . peter jackson's gci version gollum brilliant , both technically from a vision standpoint worth seeing while it's still playing on big screens
this movie was really very clever and charming to boot . doc mayhe a little over the top , but that added fun
i'v seen it about 4 times since opened back in 1985 . is creative and an incredible fusion of comedy sci-fi great catchphrases galore(mcflyyyyy) i loved the way bttf trilogy was able to work biff landing a huge pile s--t every film watched with my family yesterday kids (10 8) guess one gripe that movie has lot profanity for pg pg-13 more appropriate wife gave me copious amounts grief like what f--- does she want get them , barney meets teletubbies as if haven't heard worse school course boy doesn't help things by calling girl butthead
loved it.nothing like the original .
back to the future is a classic only star wars can take away ! great movie awsomely exsiting realy awsome charactors i have box dvd set it cool put this in all time make me feel so good about myself makes want build machince ive actully tried befor spent two million dollors and an exact copy of car on almost died tring work just kidding haha one youll buy awsome!
this movie is amazing . the storyline so well written and acting also pretty good i just love idea of could watch over again it by far best trilogy can't believe already 20 years old remember when came out you start feeling
i recently bought the 3-dvd box set of this trilogy . am *awed* and impossibly impressed to realize these movies seem not have aged at all was completely blown ; because expected it be dated is especially true in two aspects : present doesn't that unseemingly far away (even though *was* 20 years ago) , most importantly future (in bttf 2) still futuristic--in way robert zemeckis invented a seems plausible even now unwaiveringly classifying classic must watch for any sci-fi fan they can watched rewatched thanks script course but michael j fox christopher lloyd who there given performance lifetime last quick note something modern viewer will undeniably with hindsight three are surprisingly continuous it's obvious great attention has been insure form remarkably coherent (imho george lucas sure could use advice starwars)
a very fun movie ! i loved that it had something for everyone . definatly classic
the back to future series would have be amongst my favourate movies . they are relatively clean yet funny and a very interesting story line biff funniest character , not that i condone bullies ! you want know something about who plays well he became dedicated christian his ambition is spread love of god around
it wasn't the best of series , but still deserves a 5 .
one of my favorite movies all time . michael j fox is a terrific actor part 2 not on this list which i even like just little more.. but nevertheless movie incredibly unique and satisfying
i like this one the best because of it's time transport element . heroes immediately come to mind when you hear title
just as good the origional , only better because there was much more comedy mixed with drama and action in this film probably some help from joe pesci . is one of few sequels that has surpassed its i thoroughly enjoyed it start to finish writers did a great job integrating (riggs's new relationship) (the bomb on toilet) thought riggs's frequent referral german criminal adolf hilarious liked line towards end where crooked diplomat standing above says diplomatic immunity  glover shoots him responds it's been revoked than truly worth watching
micheal j . fox was so cute in this movie..i had to give it a 5 !
one great movie , actors lovely story
no other film plays irony better than this one . the scene where marty's mom kisses him near end made me shriek with laughter not enough can be said about just how funny is marty dresses like and alien tells george he darth vader from planet.. vulcan hand gesture thrown in for emphasis , then threatens to melt his mind van halen if doesn't ask loraine dance pure gold
i don't think it's possible to hate this movie . there were some funny moments with a lack of plot holes
excellent sequel , superior to the original in every way .
one of the most entertaining films ever made .
i love this movie so much . have collectibles from and of course robert zemeckis is one my favorite directors yet to meet a person who doesn't like watch awsome
man alive , i love this film ! when it comes to singling out which movie trilogy personally consider be the greatest of all 'star wars' and 'lord rings' (or at least what i've seen latter) don't stand a chance - 'back future' is put others shame . subtle witty full cool energy bttf sharply-directed first installment for wonderful epic in eighties teenager marty mcfly gets taste his parents' youth he accidentally transported back their time none other than temporal-defying delorean car few ill-advised actions soon leave plucky fighting against clock save own future from being erased acting flawless michael j fox providing best as loveable central character with wide appeal christopher llyod too great benevolant scientist doc brown while whole thing moves skillfully dynamic pace loaded some really impressive special effects (at its day) there are moments pure comic genius poignent that'll make you me anyway) want cry overall rates top notch entertainment powerful mixture action warmth humour topped off first-rate sountrack that hits spot like coke on hot day absolutely
absolutly perfect movie in all areas . it adds comedy , action adventure and sci-fi into one ! it's definatly my favorate did you know that a couple months ago was number 3 on the list of most sold dvd's ? guess what dvd doesn't even come out untill december 17 2002 shows buy pre-order don't bother to rent first its worth money
harmless and entertaining fare . i enjoyed it thought re-watchable enough to have tuned in more than once when would see popup the tv listings christopher lloyd does his usual excellent job as a bumbling , absent-minded professor not too far removed from just goofy reverend jim taxi days michael j fox doing some of better film work if this guy had been born 10 years sooner he d disney regular has face voice personality for story was fairly unique presented lighthearted amusing way loved family kept fading away things went wrong past sequels weren t hideous but often do got lamer time by overall think held up well over is still fun flick entire
back to the future is one of my favorite movies and has become an american classic . obvious problems conflicts that arise with traveling in time from 1985 1955 whole idea travel captured well this probably michael j fox's best performance marty mcfly , what a character him singing johnny b goode '50s awesome
greatest movie of all time !
the greatest movie that can still stand test of time . it has adventure , comedy a great cast (michael j fox christopher lloyd) and one first movies to use effects it's sequels are fantastic too makes you wonder about your own future this is most entertainiung films will ever see in entire lives watch again never get bored michael fox's if havn't seen where have been ? must c 4 any1 !
nice series , exciting plot and good acting on the part of michael j . fox who spices up storyline adventures main character keep your eyes glued to screen costumes makeup
great movie ! one of the few trilogies i actually liked . storyline kept it interesting , and was very exciting to watch
great movie , i still remember the day first saw it . thought was one of best movies ever made and do had everything : suspense humor action twists to plot top line good for every age group
this movie is solid gold ! i love every thing about it . the 80s rocked , and proves
this is such a great movie , one of the best all time . michael j fox in adding degree humor and excitement to ready exciting christopher lloyd also hilarious as his zany experiments backfire on him story making it my favorites
best michael j . fox movie ever made this me want to buy a delorean the sequels are just as good first
i gave back to the future a 5 because thought concept of movie was very original . liked seeing how creator perceived my favorite out trilogy second one
this movie is a classic . all lethal weapon movies are like 24 hours of an explosion non-stop action for
as times goes on , this movie gets lost in the discussions of great movies from past 10-15 years but it shouldn't . takes an old theme (time travel) and makes a part original story i only wish they had stopped at one not done two sequals
and the crowd goes wild ! go michael ur number 1 , baby
this movie was great . it makes one look at life and what actually means
if nobody knew anything about movies and entertainment all of a sudden hollywood came out with the 9 , 10 11 thousand that have ever been made at once i could see preview what were every movie hitting big screen this very time ticket prices $50 or higher terminator 2 is first i'd go because it would most stimulating appeal upon way think . dramatized action scenes sheer adrenaline sustained momentum throughout sci-fi storyline in real world setting brilliantly pieced together genuine masterpiece to say it's not my favorite be like saying sun's surface kind warm
this is my favorite of the three . it's clearly better than third , and i liked it a whole lot more first got enough action to satisfy just about anyone all reasonable in opinion plus there are characters that play an important role think well-made thriller
watching arnie expend a seemingly endless supply of ammo fending off the virtually indestructible t-1000 , inevitably blowing up many vehicles in process is supremely enjoyable . oh and rest movie ain't bad either
the movie was one best (if not best) . it's definetely on my top 10 list it brings out such a great message that sometimes we take for granted freedom mel gibson terrific..
best film of the trilogy . this has a great story although unoriginal now it greatest twist all films - arnold is good guy
my favorite of the trilogy . ah-nold transformed role from that an uncaring machine into a with soul rise machines was good , but predictable
ooh , what can i say ? it is the best movie ever hands down . so incredibly goooood ! love out of 5 stars it's a 1000
the best of trilogy for sure  ! really well made...schwartzy is always cool
i love this movie . one of the best action movies ever
one of a few sequels that could say was better than the first . definitelt among top 25 best action movies all time this movie has it , great plot special effects acting etc there is never dull moment in t2
1 uv my favorite muvies all time great graphics and sound ive watched it over a hundred times i own both but this is much better than the 1st an plan on ownin 3rd 2 collection if u havent seen c right now terminator rules
this movie rocked and raised the bar for action special effects . not only that , but it was actually better than first one linda hamilton a bad ass is nice to see her character evolve an independant woman from damsel in distress good twist on ahhhhhnold also show's guy (robert patrick) doesn't have be 6 feet tall muscle bound strong effective intimidating
i would have never thought that it was possible for a movie to make you such strong feelings of compassion machine . the special effects were terrific , even by today's standards acting just as great this stands test time one few sequels is better than original
terminator 2 was one of the only few movies that actually better than original . this movie had it all- great acting , directing awesome special effects and music redefined industry with its robert patrick's portrayal evil t-1000 excellent i very happy to see as a good guy rather bad film itself causes you have an emotional connection machine which makes ending all more depressing movie- classic !
as good it gets . this sequel to one of the best movies ever is just
i love this movie . it is totally funny there a story and action packed covered the three main things that like to see in movies
this movie is great . i think it was even better than the first it's just full of action plus , arnold schwartzenegger plays a good guy bad once again special effects stood out especially when t-1000 changes into different people
this movie rocked , it was even better than the first terminator and sequels never do as good or are . visual effects were awesome i can't wait for iii heard it's in making hope
i think if you see this and cameron as great because they introduced edward furlong is plain ridiculous sad . t2:judgement day should be respected (especially the ultimate edition dvd) for visual effects galore revolutionized industry more than people realize! ! back to movies of old , including '70s flicks (star wars aliens) looks at those compared t-1000's medamorphesis a man in cop uniform then have look fact that matrix were somewhat made same but aren't only things admired about t2 it was every little joke by arnold george thoroughgood's bad bone which like best song attachment any movie way causes emotionally attach love terminator end enough make break down crying good acting unrateable effects--they're definitely buy dvd sci-fi masterpiece
one of the few sequels that actually lived up to original . this was due addition joe pesci who added freshness movie whenever i go through a fast-food drive-thru , think leo getz it included action first and more humor than gibson glover solidified their standing as best acting tandems in recent years
this is my one of all time favorite movies . james cameron the best scifi/action director liners galore he introduced edward furlong
this movie is one of the greatest sequels over made . it has awesome special effects and an intriguing plot that twists turns a non-stop thrill ride from start to finish
one of the few movies where i actually liked sequel better than original . t2 is an extremely well made movie - special effects , casting background music everything hangs together to give you a which will keep tense throughout chase scene in evil terminator (masterfully played by robert patrick) driving 18 wheeler chasing arnold and boy on their harley far away best have seen pure excitement from beginning end
this was my favorite movie for many years .
a brilliant mix of fairy tale , swashbuckler and comedy . it kind sticks out like sore thumb on this list though
ha ! i am laughing just thinking about the movie . like it because can watch with my kids and we all laugh (unlike a lot of other crappy movies can't stand to watch) it's not dirty in any way , there is some fighting but isn't bloody good guys win end
amazing !
admit it- like me , you thought of the verbally-challenged officiant who said "what is marriage" in that memorable voice on your own wedding day . i sucessfully killed my smile 
i love the princess bride and everything about it . casting was brilliant can't imagine anybody playing parts better than original cast cary elwes great as somewhat dry , intelligent wesley/dread pirate roberts robin wright wonderful beautiful if not naive buttercup all of supporting actors were amazing wallace shawn hilarious vizzini he so mean you just to hate him on set filming gave movie a sort charm that can never be captured in studio film with something for everyone
anyone want a peanut ?
timeless
a great achievement . i know some people criticize it for deviating from the book , but don't one movie that doesn't thought they caught spirit of dumas' eloquently
this movie doesn't have any famous actors aside from billy crystal and fred savage (whose parts are very small) but it's great . a wonderful story , while it may seem cheesy (1987 special effects really aren't that good) to today's viewers still good i grew up with loved many people know love
my absolute favorite movie of all time . i can watch it anytime and get sucked into the love story is beautiful , revenge classic humor brilliant anybody want a peanut ?
after finally sitting down to watch this i could picture classictvfan pacing back and forth in his mom's basement while shouting the word inconceivable . here's a quick impression for you mean there are people on surface that don't like star trek ? well , that's just so wrong it's.. inconceivable! !
this is one of the zaniest film ever made . what makes it so special that isn't played goofy , joke straight faced and with confidence characters are brash convincing most them as lovable can be
magical fantasy , hilarious with a wonderful cast of characters .
there is so much to enjoy about this movie . first of all , it very true the book (except omitted chocolate incident and added roles fred savage peter falk) second robin wright makes a lovely strong heroine third are too many brilliant character actors in vibrant supporting mention here finally contains one best fencing scenes time creatively choreographed skillfully executed
a classic movie that is fairy tale , action-adventure and comedy .
terrific movie ! you actually can feel what james caviezal is going through and by the end of will want revenge just as bad he does . i like this so much because clever carefully planned , unlike every other where a guy gets gun starts killing everyone but very actors do job on opposite ends each
i loved it ! is the second greatest love story ever told{the first being gone with wind} . even did my hair like princess buttercup for wedding.it a beautiful colorful characters.cray elwes was too hot that's always bonus
brilliant , one of the best movies period . a cult classic i can watch this masterpiece thousand times
this was a great movie (though i liked the book even better) ; it's just so fun to watch . an odd fairy-tale of sorts , with colorful characters and ideas
this is what a family movie should be-- smart , witty non-gratuitous and made for the whole . great stuff adults young people ! i wish there were lot more movies like princess bride
i still love this movie . one of the best fantasy movies
my family and i have seen this movie many times . read the book as well a like would never be made today it is too good far from being just formula sure there's true love , but also jewish miracle man who gets into fight with wife absolutely wonderful
i thought would never find anybody who didn't love this movie but then came my brother-in-law guess he just doesn't like fairy tales . if you require intense serious dialogue and plot schemes isn't the for however have an imagination are young at heart think was one of top ten movies you've ever seen swashbuckling , pirates r.o.u.s. a beautiful princess witty hero dispicable villian revenge peter falk highly quotable lines what more can ask in how could give less than five stars is inconceivable!! !
i never get tired of watching this incredibley unique movie . great cast , story dialogue highly recommended
i absolutely loved this movie . plot - mmm , not much basically prince humpardink is after princess buttercup ( great names ) and there a lot of fantasy from on like the rous rodents unusual size etc acting?? ? decent but that as far you can go with however we do get to see 1 1/2 hours robin wright penn makes it all worth ;-) actually fantastic definitely recommended
lovely , the only true fairy tale ever filmed . great acting and editing which in a movie is half film nice humour truly magic quality that autoiroby enhances rather than diminish
the princess bride is such a cute movie . it reminds me of my grandfather , he would always read fairytales to all cast was wonderful every child should see this as wesley say you wish 
me big tough man , but princess bride make cry . it was grouse at the time of its release and now my name is inigo montario you killed father prepare to die
rob reiner hit it big when he directed stand by me , so wanted to do a comedy that would entertain us . spoofed fairy tales and stuff like lucky the princess bride billy crystal was funny as elf fred savage cute in
this is a classic in funny fantasy movies . it cool/fun way to unwind
fantastic movie ! humor in the tradition of holy grail . fun characters and plot with a fairytale ending that proves heartwarming for romantic but definitely not girly
i may have seen this movie ten times , but can't get tired of it . it's great for anyone who has ever been a little kid and everyone else too know people quote more often than ben franklin winston churchhill the bible put together delightful like two-hour chocolate sundae
only the book is better than this film . not andre giant allowed to play a rhyming ex-wrestler , but billy crystal also makes cameo appearance if you don't enjoy jokes sword-fights man or eating rodents there are disney films waiting for in children's section
my favorite film of all time . rob reiner shows his genius in this fantasy about a poor farmboy named wesley who falls love with girl buttercup the story is filled , romance comedy action and suspense i feel it something that can appeal to audiences addition supports huge hollywood cast including cary elwes robin wright penn mandy patinkin andre giant cameos by billy crystal carol kane one greatest films ever made opinion
princess bride was a wonderful fantasy movie . it had everything good story should have- humor , romance adventure and surprises superbly acted the characters lived on screen more movies like this need to be made is children adults both can love
my favorite movie because it is a very romantic comedy which comes perrilously close to being plain silly , but maintains feeling of ture love and passion . this has some wonderful lines will leave you hoping for true thinking in most positively possitively way
this is what isn't in movie , car chases aliens and russian spies . fortunately a winning formula for quasi medieval contemporary romantic comedy perfect score sure
this movie has it all ! as the wise , old storyteller says everything from wash buckling sword fighting adventure to true love . is a powerful story of bond between boy and girl their unshakable quest protect villains are humorously ludicrous movie's tongue-in-cheek humor will keep you interested
sleeper hit . very funny movie yet romantic cary elwes does a good job as the man in black mandy patinkin and andre giant provide comic relief
the princess bride is best fairytale movie . story within a helps action move along and adds lot of humor acting wonderful it leaves audience with great feeling music scenery are perfect
in addition to its profound quotability , princess bride is just a great movie . paraphrase peter falk it's got romance swordfights betrayal escapes true love death and creatures what more do you want ? dared laugh at itself still be clever not many other movies can make that claim
funny ! romantic adventurous action packed what more can you ask for in a movie ? it's classic and one of my all time favorites .
i could see this movie 1000 times and never get tired of it . stop those rhymes now mean ! anybody want a peanut ? lol
wow , i thought was the only one that loved this movie . guess not..
i really liked this movie a lot . usually am not big sci-fi person either fred savage kind of bugged me as the little kid story was being told to it is finding true love but there adventure involved too so you aren't overloaded with romance also very funny
who can compete with it it's a classic i love how he was scared of snakes .
being a movie fan ,and brought up watching the old epics on big screen,i never thought i'd ever see them bettered.that is until braveheart.the word masterpiece used little to loosely these days(forrest gump?!!),however this film must qualify.mel gibson natural director who knows what he doing.(roland emmerich please take note!).also great patrick mcgoohan in worthy role.yes , i liked gladiator too,but have agree with wiggum one,it doesn't hold candle braveheart .
this wasn't a huge blockbuster , but i know many people who regard as their favorite movie of all-time . it has all : dry humor love story action andre the giant deserved oscar consideration
allo . my name is anigo montoya you killed father prepare to die the best movie ever made , and an incredible book ! pure genius.. fencing fighting torture revenge giants monsters chases escapes true love miracles..
this is the best movie ever made . robin wright beautiful , puns are excellent i couldn't say enough about it my favorite of all time
no more ryming and i mean it . anybody want a peanut
this is the ultimate movie ! love , adventure good jokes bad puns fencing giants... . and it's got a great story line too
it's very hard to say what your favorite anything is once you get past 12 or so , but that doesn't mean can't choose things are - if makes any sense . when people ask me my movie i tell them the princess bride
everything that meathead (aka rob reiner) touches turns to gold , and this movie was no exception . perhaps andre the giant's finest hour
the princess bride is one of greatest films ever made . if your looking for adventure , fantasy or romance you will find a fulfilling movie here actors are wonderful writing excelent and direction fantastic i recommend this anyone from age three to hundred
the princess bride is best movie of all time !
it is absolutely the best movie ever , but you knew that already .
i love this movie ! memorized the entire thing and watch it several times a month , or just whenever feel like . best ever
this is my favorite movie ever!!!! !
it's fun , romantic thrilling great action and doesn't take itself too seriously . my favorite movie
absolutely hilarious - i quote it all the time
the first movie was boring in comparison to this one . scene where motion scope is picking up aliens inside room intense
great movie . they truly did their home work on this one
hi my name is laurie i never seen this movie could some one private message me and tell if should see favirote halloween thank you
one of the best sci-fi movies ever . i could watch this millions times
count on a ripping story . of first rate cast that brings the characters alive beautiful locations are feast for eyes solid and creative direction monte cristo
underrated flick . one of the best pure sci-fi flicks ever dramatic , suspenseful great special effects passably dialogue
best in the series . even though originality had worn off it a great story , good acting and effects you just don't get these days as someones already said this was years ahead of other films around one my favourite
aliens was ahead of it's time.caseless cartridges,suspended animation,etc are all real things now .
my fave of the series . i saw 1st alone in a nearly empty theater , last showing night...boy did have trouble falling asleep after that to me it was therapeutic see ripley climb back on horse suck up and show who boss get away from her you bee-otch classic
one of the few movies where sequel is at least 10x better than first
fun and exciting . aliens was far better than the first film definitely best of entire series is very high quality with above average acting performances solid action scenes fast-paced an overall joy from beginning to end
best alien movie . bill paxton was great as hudson
i've always been fond of this movie , particularly because the performances by some secondary cast .
after seeing this movie in the theatre i knew that had to own it . all action , romance and even a little bit of history rolled into story betrayal revenge one most memorable performances was richard harris gave as priest  character light hearted but still inspired broken edmund dantes not give up life never lose hope
i have always been a fan of the alien saga and second movie is simply wonderful . was captivated by first one stunned usually despise sequels , but this drew me in held tight to very end its my favorite anyway traditional look aliens tightly throughout new cast wonderfully selected also glad know they kept character ripley who single handedly gave move kick butt feel especially at which wont spoil for all havent seen most definitely head turner that should appeal any or anyone can truly appreciate good thrill ride motion picture
the best of alien series movies .
better than the 1st one .
excellent action-packed sequel to aliens . great action scenes and special effects !
better than the first one i think . it doesnt have as good a story though watch
this was the only film i've ever seen where people left theater to go bathroom watch remainder of movie from a safe distance behind safety porthole-like circular window just outside . i went (very fast  .i didn't want miss anything) passed these few watching aliens through porthole are you going back in ? asked they shook their heads and said it too scary greatest sci-fi experience will have at is still awesome on dvd , but had be there .anyone else story like also represents james cameron his artistic apex- titanic days made him highly annoying
this is the ultimate movie in sci-fi action , best of whole alien series . one was so good it there really no need to make anymore.(regrettable they did) i can't help but feel alien3 and ressurection are separate stories from first two despite fellow canadian james cameron's success with titanic my favorite his films(just barley beating out t2) opinion cameron should have done even though wasn't necessary be made
this is one intense movie . sigourney weaver takes on the creatures again and , you are edge of your seat whole time there some flat out scary moments in here too
great movie based on a book . unfortunatly like with almost all other movies books , there just isn't enough time to fit in the specifics actuality dantes goes much greater lengths obtain his revenge however director did good job of not making too long which could risk losing interest those who weren't familiar story
i watched it 22 times in a row one weekend .
wow , i forgot cameron did this one too . as a sequel i'd have to say movie couldn't be better unfortunately some blasphemous hacks leave well enough alone and had do 3 4 the third wasn't quite painful fourth though don't know what possessed sigourney weaver agree either of them
aliens is the best action film around . actors are great michael biehn as hicks , sigourney weaver ripply and bill paxton fantastic hudson storyline sequels were (although this probably of four)
a great movie to scare the crap out of anyone .
i went into the count of monte cristo with expectancy . have always known that jim caviezel can award viewer an outstanding performance , and this was no exception is by far his best to date although hear book quite different (and discovered so since begun read it) enjoyed movie completely would suggest it anyone who like see a little bit everything--romance adventure intrigue--all wrapped up one spectacular film
the best out of series . great sci-fi action thriller
weeeee-heee he heee! ! cameron at his best and havin' a ball well acted , brilliantly directed very tense . great fun watching all the marines getting creamed by what has to be meanest creatures feature in any sci-fi film i like about cameron's is that characters settings are believable hang together so you feel this really taking place somewhere - get immersed it loud fast eye-popping terrifying exhilarating one of
every rating i've read on here doesn't truly capture the greatness of aliens , cameron's space time masterpiece . in some ways a person might say that this (the special edition) is citizen kane sci-fi/monster movies i it stands it's own as one remarkably made film with impressive acting amazing mechanical effects descent visual (even though wasn't about splender) got ruthless energy comedy up ying-yang and plenty thrills to make deadest any human being leap was too young see theatrical version big screen but since then--the edition has become household name few months we can't help sit down watch great !
this is the perfect scifi movie . it's funny as hell and features an all star lineup : bill paxton , sigourney weaver that one dude
great movie . action packed no dragging good storyline a for people interested in military and science fiction
i think that aliens is one of the best science fiction movies ever . it has a very believable plot , great suspense action and little romance ending loved feeling closure had until saw next movie
this is a great movie with thrills and laughs
action packed ! it was like watching a roller coaster ride . also , the characters were great scared crap out of me
this has got 2 b the greatest sci-fi movie ever made  ! it covers , horror action comedy with such an amazing cast dialog and directon is superior . if u have never seen rush video store get now what are waiting for ? go....now
the greatest ! star wars is silly kid stuff compared to this classic .
aliens was by far the best of alien series . it showed more gruesome than others truly a thriller !
a spectacular movie with an outstanding cast . i never get tired of watching the matrix , as there is always something new exciting and intriguing every viewing keanu reeves succeeded in establishing neo hero figure he brought him to life gave all important qualities necessary move along did it unique sophisticated way this will live on through it's groundbreaking special effects alluring storyline visual experience which embodies essence that
you don't know science fiction until have watched the matrix .
i love this movie ! can watch it over and again not get tired of .
this movie wins you casually , as though not seeming to have make an effort despite its grandeur and scope with one of the great all time novels watching back . actors a lot fun their roles action is scenery costumes ironies romance are ideallic strongly recommended
best of the trilogy . great effects good and original story alrite acting fight scenes
every time i watch this movie see some thing new . keanu , who is not my favortie actor does a good job in he will always be theodore logan to me the rest of cast excellent and effects are spectacular if you have been living cave it awesome looking forward sequals update : well were bit bust but original still holds up
now this is a movie that had bit of everything . awesome from start to finish keanu reeves was absolutely sensational in flick...two thumbs up !
this was a fascinating and deep movie on many levels.very symbolic well done....too bad the sequels are worthless,stupid,vapid commercials for video games,devoid of any substance at all .
best of the three - agent smith was worth price admission .
a movie i could watch over and again . the deep plot underlying it is one to ponder , its ties philosophy theology religion ingenius there are so many little things notice that you didn't catch first time special effects nice acting okay but what really gets me idea everything around dream world connections ancient cultures theories excellent intelligent film
i cannot even begin to describe how truly amazing this film is . a far cry from the tripe awful sequels that spawned what could only be described as great mind maze of pure genius matrix completely different sci-fi pre-decessor genre and there was no before reached cinematic heights parody - bullet-time (slow-motion scenes) shrek , centre park commercials etc special effects storytelling it hails many questions about our minds constant reliance computers world we live in still haven't been answered
what an ace film ! how come so many peole didn't like it ? i thought was great canoe reeves is really good and especially the ending! . superb
for those who didn't follow the movie trilogy.. . it's hard to make a about christ (the anointed one) and explain human/spiritual condition of world without getting ridiculed neo is play on words if you switch letters around , one thus once mr anderson became fully enlightened he only referred himself as don't get reference jesus right there because buddah they linked these 2 together same person reason that's why trilogy flooded with quotes from bible in reloaded before met seriph (who an angel by way) were shrines shown i can point so many things out like becoming trinity after his arrival zion metaphors go watchowski brothers very slick writing direction this call excellent
i'll tell you , this movie is incredibly deep intelligent awesome fun-to-watch interconnected mind-tweaking and insanely thought-out marvel of a actually . in fact don't even try to understand the whole thing first time watch it isn't physically possible has so much freakin' content that people who claim i'm wrong they do get are i'd bet i entire spite i've seen at least ten times there websites devoted simply philosophy implied by matrix be fair critics have an obligation mean lie make fun every single (ok bit exaggeration) why most accommidating musn't letting their true feelings show through either or they're asses complement impossible-to-comment-on blaringly incredible storyline comes revolution visual effects larry andy fired bar out cannon technique bullet-time from suggests fully realized second installment namely virtual camera scene completely mapped on computer three dimensions allowing absolutely any angle motion view manifested burly brawl flesh-and-blood would been torn pieces if had gone motions suggested tight fast turns swings slow required tighter faster real-time which real eternally bound series was originally designed one story but way too long put together into dude animated ! alone made blockbuster no more were invented for stunning when especially third over you're body will jittering adrenaline sore chills two your mind race scour frame addicted watching able
keanu reeves shines in almost every movie he has ever done , and the matrix is no exception . i didn't really care for storyline such but made it excellent with his oscar worthy presence...excellent  !
one of the best action movies ever made .
without a doubt the best action flick ever made . it still impresses me to watch fight scenes in this one second and third installments have nothing on film seems much more singular focused than its sequels use of bullet time photography has been endlessly parodied characters duplicated again is movie that every other wishes could be
this movie is the ultimate role model for other sci-fi movies . it has a cool storyline which out of world i mean machines trap humans in computers to generate energy , and order do that they make computer-generated dreamworld called matrix are making believe real wow would never come up with an idea like graphics alone pioneer its kind bullet timing effect famous since came fight scenes very well choreographed keanu reeves' acting notch so what more can say !
this is what helped dvd players sell , i don't know which was better the story or style (which every director and their mother copied off of) everything well put together beautifully cinematography iwas so inovative it a pure work of geinus . line may be hard to follow for some but if you like think little bit instead having right in front you. you'll love reloaded just as good unfortunately thats where they should have stopped because revolutions seemed rushed leaves audience feeling empty at least me
braveheart is amazing-it isn't my type of film but when i saw it , changed the way thought.the pure strength william wallace(at least in if not real life) inspiring and makes you believe that anyone can change world they enough
very cool . the special effects are great
i dont know what to say...its just the best movie ever .
the best fightng special effets i've ever seen , and for a sci-fi movie acting wasn't bad
well , it's time once again for my favorite rate it all pasttime : singling out morons ! and the award goes to...classictvfan47 what kind of neo-fascist are you ? have a seriously unhealthy obsession with profanity that might do by some professional counseling . did guy who stole your lunch money say f*ck every he what's hang up association i think i've sufficiently handled subject in comments on swearing so anyone interested should look under decided to read few after saw rating jackass or as eloquently state donkey show mental midget thought could let most slide until matrix boring tedius pessimsitic sci-fi film is terribly overrated combines objectionable content plot creeps star trek best franchise there watch hundreds hours brilliant than this movie exactly be about oh no resistance movement involves violence nothing sacred how effective would story an entire population total mind control if wasn't creepy disturbing never seen villify serial killer dressing them bunny suit having snuggle babies learn deal but then hit me further inspection learned certain affinity things like al gore liberalism that's when pieced together just such willing automaton fears becoming unplugged from neo-socialist machine moreso plague fact portrays negatively startling parallel communist utopia mass ignorance neo-socialists yourself fuzzily dream was probably little less comfortable good soldier
absolutely amazing movie..the special effects were out of this world..keanu reeves acted brilliantly and was supported really well by lawrence.the story spectacular though it slightly slow in the starting covered up end which good fun..it paved a new way for sci-fi movies
this movie tops it all off . great graphics , story i keeps you on the edge of seat can even make wonder is possible that i'm living in a matrix ? how would know wouldn't ! cast was perfect for love lead agent his voice sounds like could be computer program if havn't seen rent better buy because will don't listen do these people rate 1-star get out there and now
this has to be one of the most cleverly thought up sci-fi movies all time (perhaps maybe star wars) , storyline was great and special effects are in a class their own . i can't wait till sequel only probelm had with movie goofy love story between neo trinity.....what laugh
not my favorite but good all the same , i don't like keanu reeves he's pretty in this movie . overall
this has to be one of my favorite movies all time . although the plot left certain questions , that doesn't defeat fact it is a film requires you use your mind and in depth analysis could possible situation we might faced with future also made cinematic effect awe audiences for ages br i add provided lot context more man vs machine philosophy example.. allegory cave light by plato parallelised matrix real world terms christian theology know neo had come save according oracle means new but if unscramble letters forms  why did they name character trinity ? there bastard betrayed them?.. hm..
one of the weirdest and best movies you may ever see . matrix combines awesome special effects , a great story line spectacular acting all into sci-fi films this is must for any fans unusual don't leave movie store without it
my all time favorite movie
most of the people who saw it either loved or hated . really depends on you taste i personally thought movie was good
this movie is so cool ! very exciting , and impressive visuals make a must-see if you have dvd watch it on that because makes twice as good
this movie has it all ; great plot background , movement effects and acting . plus the dvd added features
great entertainment  ! this movie has just reset the standard for sci-fi . i can't wait sequel
the plot is very interesting and imaginative . i love this movie
the matrix is one of coolest movies ever . try watching it w/ sound down and crystal method's las vegas over amazing...almost pink floyd- wizard oz  beautiful visual images a story line that doesn't really overwhelm i loved thought keanu reeves was excellent ! truely greats
very few times does a film come along that changes not only the way is made , but also to finally find intertaining and yet it equally intelligent . play down for anyone many has you really thinking about what if  this combined with an incredible cast makes classic ironically it's in class all by self
i think that this is the best movie by far for sci-fi genre . if you have not yet seen matrix see it,now!! ! can barely contain my excitment next two releases will be coming out 2 due in 2002 , and 3 2003 bet standing line first showing!!
this is one of the best movies ever . just whole idea living in matrix boggles mind action and fighting scenes were great special effects made it even better i can't wait for sequel
a qualitative step ahead . computer graphics and suspense make it look real the leading role is played by keanu reeves , which really doesn't lot of sense from point view an aesthetic person other roles fine including negative characters
the special effects were good . storyline was a little complicated , but it still movie i can't wait to see part ii
keanu reeves is really a good actor , from bill and ted to speed then the matrix . if you like special effects this movie for it also has soundtrack don't have buy today !
so keanu did a stellar job (yeah , sure) but he comes in second to lawrence fishburne's morpheus who displays fabulous master skills and great lines . add the effects you've got five
this movie was excellent in all aspects of film making , from the martial arts choreography to stunning visual effects screen play transitions . matrix is original breathtaking and a masterpiece meaning behind it shows us that our world ruled by beast which humans are enslaved empower breathe life into we can break free oppression others at own will
this is a really good movie ! i'd have to say that the best part of it was way visually presented , with dark bleak atmosphere pervading entire film (with few important plot line exceptions course such as oracle's house) . there great amount visual detail throughout especially in climax which arranged look just like shoot'em up arcade style video game
innovative story with lots of computer graphics . suspenseful and successful ending continuous action plot show quality
im not even bored of after seen it 13 times . one the best action movies ever made
everyone likes the matrix , it relates to underground of computing . male/female doesn't matter but keanu reeves can't act special effects are cool and makes a rental
awesome effects , great storyline with many twists and turns .
excellent movie with great special fx . thought the directing of was very good and performance by actors gave a credible job dvd version is cool , bits pieces making also had an audiotrack director's commentary which kung fu fighting
what is the matrix ? awesome plot , great kung fu sequences kick ass visuals and special effects . this movie ! 5 stars
great entertaining movie . asks and answers a few questions about life but this shouldn't deter you from it i enjoyed brought new element to directing action films in general well done the wachowski brothers!! !
i really great movie because of the special effects and graphics . think story line is very interesting with humans being used as batteries
this movie is one of my favorites . it's like the best ever see how it affects other movies in way they do special effects- just try to be matrix story good and imaginative
this was such an original story and script . it able to play off well with the of good versus evil there a lot action costumes were cool
flat out the coolest movie ever made . best sfx and a great storyline this brought up some points on what may happen if we continue with ai in machinery it could might be!! !
the matrix is best movie ever . special effects are breathtaking however , unlike some other movies with great this also has a good interesting plot something that really lost in most films today chicks leather cool
one of my favourite films ! ok it took on a difficult plot but handled pretty well despite few logic gaps , although i wish they'd worked something else out for when neo comes back to life at the end . enough that fanatastic innovative use special effects baddest fight scenes can ever remember seeing in film dash mysticism with morpheus oracle great bad guy agent smith and action blow your mind this will be benchmark flicks next twenty years
just amazing . excellent use of imagery and camera work , wonderfully presented above-average plot for a sci-fi movie plenty charisma on-screen presence action entertaining script
matrix makes me feel so alive!!!! !
this is a great sci-fi movie for any age . it was full of effects such as bullet-time the plot second to none : select few battle machines ; super ai computers that have taken over world and turned humans into duracells
the matrix was full of excellent special effects along with a daring , rarely seen plot . portrayals outside world and created that is consistant imaginative see it at least once-you'll wish you could again
this movie was , in my point of view the best 1999 ! special effects set new standards yet story awesome and most all fighting scenes only thing one may dislike about matrix is that there wasn't a relationship between neo trinity . i saw 3x theaters
matrix was a movie that revolutionized the way movies are made today . all slow motion , multi-camera angled shot scenes in had moviegoers going wild at theaters directors using its style now like upcoming charlie angels big star cast this with will make millions box office
wow !
this is one of my favorite movies . the great special effects combined with good actors (except keeanu) and a story make it awesome
this is one of the greatest sci-fi movies all time . with mind blowing special effects , matrix really packs a punch but what sets it apart from other its incredibly original plot makes you look differently at world around
this is far and away the best movie i have ever seen . it skillfully weaves multiple plot lines genres into a seamlessly original , inventive story laden with unprecedented special effects pure visual candy villains are intimidating heros believable inspiring cannot recommend film enough !
matrix was a really good movie because of the special effects , music costumes and actors . lot stuff new so it unseen which made better
a new mythology for generation . own it watch again and just wish that someday , you too will find follow the white rabbit
absolute twist . rollercoaster ride to sci-fi ! something that never ever been on screen
a really awesome movie . the storyline was very spiritual , it made people think even though they didn't know were thinking
the matrix was a great movie that captured audience's attention for whole two hours with amazing special effects and an incredible story . i saw this four times in theater because action just so keanu reeves perfect as neo , found myself feeling he felt discovered things overall think one of best movies made last year
matrix is the best martial arts scifi film . it has a complex story that makes you think i can't wait till sequel because stop motion effects from first one me thinking about what's next
great movie despite the fact it had keanu reeves .
keanu reeves best movie since speed . the effects are awesome and can not be rivaled can't wait till sequel
wow , this movie left me with big questions . it tested possibilities and had so many facts of the unknown played into you to believe makes wonder much doubt anything that can make somewhat convinced curious wondering has be awesome
it was like watching a comic book come to life . amazing story with great action while being philosophical at the same time
sick flick with hella special effects . keanu reeves deserved best actor while the hot chick from threesome also did a stellar job
this movie had everything : plot , martial arts story and special effects . in touch with reality presented ideas future thinking
one of the best sci-fi movies to date . great graphics and good story as well storyline is unique interesting movie , must see
really great movie . the special effects were pretty good it has a storyline and plot
i am the matrix ! rule , everything . cash rules around me come get money dollar bill y'all
great special effects . terrific storyline , action actors blended perfectly together really can't wait until part two the music in it was awesome/
i love this ingenious movie ! the graphics were great and plot kept me thinking until end of , which also what is next going to be like ? how will one thrill deffinately rubbed right way . story was confusing made wonder if t his really on but just brushed it off that feeling realize about 10% more smart creation would reccomend anybody likes keep wondering 'til
oh boy.....the matrix , its a funny thing but here am i looking at this wondering yes . could be true is it really going on! ? well..... sorta like that i've been reading book in the bible called ephesians written by someone named apostle paul he was prison writting to particular people telling explaining who they are and what supposed doing lets forget traditional stuff move on real present future ! only sci-fi reflection of truth -----neo saves so does jesus christ
when i first saw that the matrix was coming out thought it going to be another big bomb but after watching over and again , really liked . good special effects even acting
the matrix is by far one of best and most unique new sci-fi movies there . combination brand photographic cgi (computer generated imaging) technologies , plus a stupefying storyline create movie that feast for eyes mind watching it first time like being hit with ton bricks leave you dumbfounded aching more ! just right kick-ass fight scenes romance betrayal this has everything viewer could want (though i wouldn't watch some parts weak stomach) depth meaning underlies story astounding rabbithole can take as they to go took plunge let me tell whoa it's worth definitely look if not second or third
great movie to have on dvd !
undoubtedly the best and most thought provoking , fantastically acted electronically manipulated futuristic film of today .
that this movie belongs to a clearly recognizable genre -- man vs . machine in no way detracts from its cinemtaic value the question is , does it do service ? definitely yes ! whenever filmmakers successfully combine stunning visual effects interesting characters and thought-provoking storyline they've got winner deserves be watched over again
brilliant special effects keanu is at his best the music excellent and plot so out of this world it makes you think could be real ?
this is the best movie i have ever seen . it had sf/x fight scenes.ive over 20 times
does anyone know where i can get a pair of morpheous' sunglasses from ? would be very grateful if you could let me . richcowell@uk.packardbell.org i'll make it worth your while help find
the matrix is best movie . watching it a first time isn't enough , surely my favorite ! effects are awesome keanu reeves so hot if you haven't seen this yet go out get
this has become my favorite movie of all time . i can watch it over and never get tired can't wait for the sequels jim
this movie was very deep and i really enjoyed the special effects .
if you're someone who's a non-thinking movie zombie - don't go to this one . it keeps you on your mental toes while entertaining action , love social issues and great special effects all wrapped into ! can't wait for the sequel!
this movie rocks!! ! couldn't have asked for a more thought out movie-ever! from the plot , to dialouge all tied together with special effects .
wow ! that's the only accurate description . makes you really think less know first time see it , better movie is
fresh movie w/ serious maryist metaphysics .
i've seen _the matrix_ four times . there isn't any other movie bothered to see more than once
great effect , high action
it is not very often than i see a movie two times in row , without even leaving the theatre . matrix works depth with cyberpunk and real science this kind of that draws you makes think excellent fight scenes
cool effects .
absolutely loved this movie and always will . my favorite non sci-fi film ever(barley beating out mad max saturday night fever) wow what a i was sixteen when saw flim to say it totally absorbed me is an understatement tom curise be maverick val the iceman of course athony edwards goose at least anyway had all music , great cast awsome special effects dog fighting scenes mean made want pilot not just any but naval aviator.(officer gentlman did same lesser extent) still love songsfrom soundtrack (especially mighty wings by cheap trick) another with bulid up opening try find guy who teenager in mid 80's didn't or like very personal for feel need ,the speed looks good today
best sci-fi movie ever made , bar none .
the matrix is such an excellent movie . people didn't really understand move it was about more than appears to be
a very innovative movie , neat effects without lacking of plot . it made you think when finished watching also me question some things in life
matrix was an extremely creative idea . you know a movie is good when you're still talking about it days after saw
great movie . i loved the predator 2 is better think..
here is a story where you have two usa state governors in the same flick , arnold schwartznegger and jesse ventura . boys are on a-team central america hunting guerillas tangle with ruthless alien that becomes invisible actually for sport !
incredibly good . suspenseful , creative decent science fiction and well acted who would have thunk the movie feature 2 future governors (it been 3 as they originally cast jim mcgreevey predator's boyfriend) apollo freakin creed was in it too this drips with testosterone
the best sci-fi movie i ever saw .
arnold kicking alien butt !
one of the best sci fi movies ever !
excellent , gritty film with arnold battling an alien many high-tech weapons at his disposal . you never really doubt who will come away the victor but that's why we go to movies see struggle
excellent suspense . great action any villan that can kick jesse ventura's butt is ok by me
yes , this was a good outing for ahnold . the first sequel pretty fair also dread of machine that couldn't be stopped gut wrenching when you watched it
still the best of all terminators . yeah effects look really dated but they are effective and arnold is an awesome special effect by himself story moves along better than other two unlike in t2 there no heavy handed message bogging movie down
probably my favorite sci fi flick . the special effects dont look bad even 20 years later arnold was born to play role of terminator pretty tight script , if you course discount absurdity time travel
really a classic , lovely movie that is still good to watch of course great actors in it too
a fine movie , with good performances all around . script direction
i have always loved this movie . it was the stepping stone to stardom for cameron and arnold you could even make a case hamilton an all-time great sci-fi
this movie unquestionably is a classic . it redefined the industry , with its awesome special effects (although not like that of t2) was arnold's step to stardom he perfect as terminator perfectly cast and linda hamilton exceptionally good sarah connor directing astounding musical score
very cool . the terminaor had a great story and good action i`ll be back
still arnold's best movie . it's very dark in tone , but it does have some small tongue cheek moments once the story is set into motion doesn't let up until end and you will be on edge of your seat !
far better than the second installment .
i do love this film . the only problem have is script no doubt cameron put his hand in it big time really think he should stick to teh producing and directing me terminator more a story than anything else main storyline keep sarah conner alive so she conceives her son john who will help mankind beat cybertech computer system reece gets sent back by , knows that dad has be (i know complicated) arnie was originally meant play part of but both himself thought he'd better as sfx are very good considering when done
camerons first foray into major filmmaking is a triumph showing technical virtuosity and great skill with his limited budget . allowing the story to be main driving force , bringing three unknown actors real chance arnold being star in this pounding action thriller
one of the best movies all time . scene where terminator is in a bathroom cutting his eye pretty bad , but that only thing i dislike about this great film if you don't like roller coaster rides and one-liners stay clear
cameron's first masterpiece , proved that he was a likely contender with already-appreciated directors like spielberg or scorsese . the man made arnold star is and several more unforgettable classics along side superstar why-o-why can't cameron get together to do true lies 2 ? i know terminator 3 add up it's predecessors without these two icons of film original has impressive effects given 6 million dollar budget for times in which it they didn't have matrix yet (sarcastic) but you people realize revolutionize enough so could actually make action most movies relentless intense.. as should be comedy subtle all also can sinister romance nudity kind (which adds story instead dipletes integrity) this model every picture since i've seen at least
a good original movie . lot of movies are based from this one special effects for that time the best storylines
a great , sci-fi movie . how cool was schwarzenegger as the unstoppable killer robot from future ? i remember reading somewhere that arnold offered role of either hero or villan in this and against advice his friends managers he decided to be turns out it smartest move could have made schwarzenegger's acting is so terrible plays semi-human perfection
ahnold at his best ! this movie kicks ass
this movie was a classic . it much better then the first one when ever i watched that , used to think 'i wish could do all of fly shoot laser beams out my eyes had super strength etc.' plus there hardly any swearing in and fairly clean apart from few violent scenes superman's adverseries were amazing especially woman broke big thug pub's arm he an wrestle with her helicopters shot missiles at 2 colleagues they wern't harmed !
come to me son of jor-el kneeeeeeeeel before zod! . love it terence stamp play's this asshole brilliantly the fight in new york gives film five stars alone christopher reeve at his absolute best
great movie . captured the comic tone while developing kent / lane romance , and it was a nice twist to see supes go through hell back appreciate his powers put dalliance in proper perspective i wish spiderman hulk batman xmen directors paid more attention first 2 movies - they might've learned something
better than the original , second superman cinematic sojourn boasts some terrific ideas : three super-villains a very human clark kent and in love . clark's revenge diner makes one want to stand up cheer great stuff
best burt reynolds film ever!! !
this film is amazing!! ! the special effects are breathtaking . plot gripping it's one of those films that you watch over and again withour getting bored it i love every single them hey didn't know there's going to be a 4th ? great!!!!!
it is ok .
when i first saw this movie , enjoyed it so much had smoke coming out of my vcr . loved the special effects and how all wrapped together
a warning ? it's not nice to fool mother nature .
holy crap , cute and cuddly
i loved this movie ! tom cruise was awsume and very cute in really want to be a pilot so . it is sad , funny intense an movie:)
imaginative , interesting characters great looking dinosaurs . no problems here
i love the jurassic park movies ! just really enjoy superb action , wonderful effects and beautiful music that goes along with it . it's not for everyone but definitely me can't wait until fourth movie comes out was suppsed to be already they haven't started filming don't know who director will even storyline yet well anyways new date #4 is supposedly summer 2006 in case you want go :)
at the time this movie was made , cg image programs like maya were just coming out which realism possible . story line interesting and direction great pioneered other movies with animated animals scenery spielbergh broke ground proved it could be done 5 stars !
hey ! i saw this when was 8 . and totally thought it real for sure!..then got lil older an watched able to judge myself..it incredible!
a great movie,like lot of crichton's books .. . spielbergs done nothing special apart from copying the book , and product is awesome
when i was a kid in the 60s , dinosaurs rocked my world . alas any movie depiction of dinos back then were so cheesy that even as an 8-year-old thought to myself lamosaurus read crichton's book before there talk film adaptation and liked it saw they first debuted thoroughly impressed no amazed at star tyrannosaurus ate selfish lawyer while he sat on crapper should have won best actor award supporting went dilophosaurus did newman (i bet seinfeld wishes dilophosaurus) human cast ok laura dern looked particularly great shorts spielberg magnificaent for couple hours convinced me alive sequels are worth seeing but don't match up jp
loved the movie ! great plot about dinos getting out . they had to have innocent little kids in there too (who did great) storyline and acting was excellent spielberg made an all time favorite of mine also special effects are amazing
i found jeff goldbloom very intense in his part , thought he and sam neil made a great team hope the fourth one has both of these excellent actors together again .
a classic movie .
this film formed the major part of my childhood . sadly following films lacked something in opinion so many great things are based around acting , special effects at time it was like nothing else
one of my favorites , although the book was better . but in hindsight novels are always than movies if they made movie exactly like novel would be 10 hours long
this is a great movie . i love it the sets for look so empressive along with cgi and idea of cloning dinosaurs isn't to far fetched truly one greatest spielberg movies all time exciting throughout whole you are captovatide way threw if havn't seen , definate must see truley
i absolutely loved this movie , infact own it ! mel gibson is always a hint that the going to be great . itself was pleasant mixture of comedy and drama laughed cried atsonished would recommend anybody
best movie ever made .
a great movie . almost as good the book
one of my favorite movies , jurassic park is suspenseful throughout and with action-a plenty it's sure to be a great adventure as you get captured in the world . more than
very good movie . sam niell and jeff goldbloom are the perfect people for their roles , even though book is better
the best movie of it's kind ! can't wait to see jp 3 this july 18th , 2001 .
great movie !!!!! ! it was my favourite before i have seen  : arlington road
this movie brought up a few good points about fooling around with dna reconstruction . it shows that things cannot always be predicted aside from , also very cool and realistic sfx
amazing technology graphics . the dinosaurs look so rel script was also super i actually lost myself in movie and for a second believed that there were dinosuars alive
this was a good movie , even though i thought that there would be hella ass in but guess wrong . otherwise it
the best! !
great special effects , good sense of magic and wonder .
best most powerful superhero . movie of the decade !
an instant classic !
the very first movie i saw in a theater . still great light hearted , good moving spectacular entertainment quite funny spots to bad chris reeve is dead that sucks
christopher reeve is the best superman ever ! only person who really gave life to character and made us believe that a man can fly .
top gun is my favorite movie of all time . it a classic action packed and filled with great comedy tom cruise was perfect actor for the role he played very good story
the best super-hero movie of all time , with one john williams' scores . 2001's dvd release 1978 film is really good but beware : commentary track shabby and badly recorded isolated score fails to live up its promise otherwise this presentation other extras are great
awesome movie ! christopher reeve is the definitive superman . this film made with so much heart and soul it's far superior to any of overblown batman movies
the best version of superman ever , will probably never be topped . special effects are great and haven't really dated also hats off to john williams for that terrific score which must onwe written overall cast is good sets smashing !
this is the best movie i have ever seen . although am brought close to tears upon mention of christopher reeves , my childhood hero after his tragic accident and then car commerical in which he walks gives me hope for future
i believe that superman was the catalyst of all upcoming superhero movies . remember as a kid , used to love watching even though if it my 10th time
superman is the best superhero in world ! christopher reeves made ever . i've just been a big fan of since i can remember
one of my favorite movies growing up . christopher reeve is perfect playing a nerdy clark kent and using terms like swell  on the other hand he plays superman to fantastic billing oscar winner gene hackman perfectly cunning as lex luther
greatest hero ever . first comic book action that came onto the screen as a big hit
one of the scariest flicks ever made . i guess it was blotter that dropped befor going to flick in 79 !
not as good aliens , but still great . this is the first of decent alien movies i think these would eat e.t up for breakfast go shame it never explains where they cam from in any films
this film is fantastic . ridley scott at his best its protagonist , ellen ripley defies the stereotypes put on strong women characters she's no elle woods ! did anyone besides me notice windchime theme throughout movie ? they were everywhere anyhow it's a timeless classic
super ! i've seen dozens of times & it still grabs me . the writing is superb , acting terrific tension really builds as alien slowly picks off one at a time best scene where ripley (after everyone else killed) almost runs into creature on her way shuttle it's creepy sneaks around corner also horrifying comes upon parker lambert while they're collecting up coolant if you're horror/sci-fi fan you must have this in your collection
i have to put it down as the movie that made me close my eyes most of any i've seen . in space , no one can hear you scream ads said back '79 but there was sure a lot screaming theater day damn cat jonesy scary freakin' alien horrorific aside sexiness both girls on nostramo were dolls sight sigourney weaver bikini panties nearly getting her rump patted by raw followed sheer terror great
rightly one of the scariest movies all time . no other film instills fear and lonliness in viewer like this picture i nearly soiled myself when alien's hand shot out wall or it pops that guys chest
probably the scariest movie ever made . suspenseful from beginning to end not a rip-off of an earlier as someone else had suggested tag line says : in space-no one can hear you scream
i am a big sci-fi lover so alien immediately drew me in . with an awesome cast and very memorable main character (the that is) this movie veritable thrill ride the action seldom takes stop as ripley , human is forced to save herself her crew cat wonderfully done undoubtedly most notable feature picture it tries kill off each of crewmembers thing probable like about what movies jaws predator would be fact you dont see much monster till near end constantly seeing your running from just makes sense wonder leave entirely have always loved saga fist bunch defiantly great one highly recommend all lovers
alien (released in 1979 , two years after star wars) is a science fiction movie which addresses the contemporary human condition . director ridley scott creates dark and futuristic yet eerily organic world hints at problems of today but with additional veneer whizbang technology inhuman corporate omnipresence (scott returned to these undertones blade runner.) viewer able relate characters as they are thrust into increasingly impossible challenges forced make decisions that place emotion logic conflict (eg ripley refusing allow dallas kane back ship) faced primordial fears deadly creature lurking damp shadows (as presence felt rather than seen) original much better any sequels film doesn't overly rely on action dialogue well done working even when understated (ripley also becomes too hard core erodes concept for her character an unwilling heroine.) design earned designer h.r giger oscar best visual effects special were excellent time release (and still hold up today) musical score melds theme feeling bottom line remains landmark genre due its emphasis reality humanity opposed some kind utopian ideal
even almost 25 years , stil the most scariest space movie ever . creature bursting out of that man's chest is still best scene music also very scary a lot scarier than many modern science fiction and thriller movies some scenes-the alien derelict ship with pilot skeleton egg room burster killing brett in dark cargo hold stalking dallas air vent being on ripley's shuttle ash attacking ripley deleted which finds cocooned
a very scary movie . this is one of the only movies that truly scares me you have these people trapped out in space , middle nowhere with alien who's menacing and frightening look matched by its killer instinct
very good . the alien was cool and scene were pops out of guys chest great
in my top 10 of greatest all time movies , and now one the best-produced dvds out there . great ensemble casts excellent original set designs from cramped lived-in nostromo ship sets to gloomy alien caverns bio-ship interiors dark planetscapes itself is best designed creature sf ever complete with a biological history egg adult better than aliens alien3 worst series but still not that bad (4) : resurrection good companion piece this first truly healthy dose anti-government anti-corporate paranoia which was expanded on sequels jones -- most troublesome-- cat space jerry goldsmith's beautiful score his dvd has two isolated scores so you can hear music way he meant have it movie if like at you'll love packed lots extras
very , good sci fi film . its not a wham bam here's all the action at once this develops slowly and has hooks in it that make you jump out of your seat keeps eyes glued to screen same time ! music is great sfx aren't particularly but makes up for with acting plot designs hr giger i can watch over again
this movie easily amazed me when i first saw it . the dark atmosphere projected was beautiful , and presentation of alien excellent you never really whole in a single scene which gave for mysterious feeling at an original concept birth life cycle or creature seemed very to had good story reason like more than others because sigourny weaver wasn't glorified heroine she just another equal member crew trying survive
alien is the best space horror flick ever made . special effects are exquisite , and eventhough viewer can predict deaths of some characters ridley scott still able to surprise audience performances sigourney weaver john hurt brilliant story has no equal tension easily conveyed
this has got to be my favorite sci-fi horror film ever made . is ridley scott's master peice of i would have say the best alien saga know alot people beg differ and aliens beats disagree which harder ? create a movie with blood , guts explosions machine guns marines screaming f*ck me sh*t every other line or but instead gun fire use plot character development story that actually touches on many deep seated fears great meditation isolation,lose hope dispair there really no good happy message taken from almost true real life situations damn man government working against us ! they don't care who dies as long our nation weapons very performances talented ensemble cast fantastic directing scott above all one most enfamous monsters devised treat filled jumps chills dark beauty highly racomended check out rest series if you get chance are pretty films by ground breaking directors
i really like this movie a lot . keeps you interested in what's happening the it doesn't make bored
the tag 'first of a kind' may be bit stretch , but i don't remember too many movies where sci-fi suspense horror were so neatly put together before alien . another twist was that captain is first major figure to go - surely broke rules and we have action heroine as well ! great movie
what is to be said about a movie that frightened me back in 70s and still can do so today ? i'll get straight the point of why this worked perfectly , whereas sequels (the exception being aliens) did not . you actually know like characters director ridley scott allows acquainted with 7 crewmembers we see them carry on conversations interact each other for nearly 40 minutes awaken eat work together humor tension as they socialize then exterminated one by barely-seen presence known alien pain hear dying gasps kane who unwillingly became host brett helplessly carried away into ventilation shaft dallas without chance react dark narrow airvent ash robot betray crew their very lives heartless company order parker beg lambert he sacrifices himself cry scream shock hold our breath ripley she trembles at sight her shuttle all works only because cast but glimpses biomechanical design out psyche h.r giger was smart show nightmarish creature it leaves audience gaping void left imagination add beautiful eerie music jerry goldsmith along great screenplay you've got perfect formula classic horror sci-fi has held its own 20 years will continue
very good movie . i would recommend it to adults , may be a bit harsh for young people
the ultimate sci-fi horror movie
trully the best of alien saga , this is a classic sci-fi with intrigue and probably crafted back story i have ever seen . movie was left completely open for great sequel it pity never happened hr giger genius design greatest part questions viewer asking little mystery always good anyone who does not like simply understand tom skerrit sigourteny weaver yaffat koto john hurt were definately ridley scott music by jerry goldsmith everyone must see
his arms are over 21 in this film
this is the fantasy all others are to be compared ! i grow a big rubbery one just thinking of conan,(schwarzenegger) and his muscular , bronzed body ripping enemies apart limb from unmatched swordplay comedy pissed my pants really go see it now
conan (schwarzenegger) is the ultimate barbarian in this one as he shows off his sword , fighting and strength skills . slays monsters bends bars (under waterfall) fantasizes about beautiful valeria almost hooks up with 18 year old princess entire movie she dreams of what lies under arnolds loin cloth (very sexy romantic) crushes all enemies including 7'1" bombatta (chamberlain) nearly wets himself when sees coming toward him steel watch for lifting open gate trys to help so that malik can slip inside lock it very action packed its a must see you better pray crum destroyer doesnt come next!!!!!! !
the best fantasy i have seen , arnold (conan) has 20 1/2 in arms 3 inches smaller that olypia but huge . watch for roll-off after horse duel bombatta (chamberlain) and conan team up an unstoppable force until end they fight whoops his ass even though wilt says he slept with over 20,000 woman anyway its a five star must see film all muscle wizards you can handle..
watch out for big wilt the stilt in this one , bombatta and conan pray to different gods but join forces make a dream team .
the second best in new trilogy
if you haven't seen this movie , then are missing out . terribly violent but a wonderful all the same action adventure romance huuuuge battle scenes heros traitors has it acting directing everything
top gun was the best fighter movie ever made . soundtrack to it makes you get an adrenaline rush pilots make feel like are in sky
i am probally going to get slammed for this , but like and the phantom menace alot .
this sequel chronicles anakin skywalker and how he started to turn evil . great battle scenes , music special effects an excellent plot
palpatine continues his conquest of domination and destruction the republic . he looks a little more tired in this one because quest for galactic is taking its strain similar to phantom menace that keeps pushing gaining stronger hold on senate by not just being chancellor time but gets elect him as supreme commander/dictator still turmoil brought trade federation again playing , used them get elected here uses clone army approved gain ultimate control over at same some termites who make battle droids construct plans death star has count dooku deliver coruscant i like much than darth maul was all braun no brains think will have bit trouble getting rid going really work out smarting next film there can be only emperor jango fett badass image fett's we got from boba old movies look forward seeing action third movie effects with were excellent exemplifies everything bounty hunter should wars universe what wish could seen doing sarlacc pit jedi an unfitting end history if ever saw take head off lightsabre or call it draw anything igniting jetpack mistake sending headfirst into jabbas skiff then tumbling mouth kinda ironic misfire jangos did ? way how come stormtroopers early films are so easy killoff they clones deadly inventive guess inbreeding 30 years nuff said attack fun nice addition saga
great movie ! good storyline , ended happy not too violent music and funny . it had all the best elements put together
good movie . cool fight scenes
wow ! what an incredible movie first return of the jedi was my favorite , then phantom menace and now attack clones we're talking great acting awesome special effects battle scenes even humor with jar-jar 3p0 . not extended length is a downer highly recommended for all
i could ramble on endlessly about how the act in which anakin returns to tatooine save his mother is handled a manner that makes it seem like time-filler , or budding romance between and padme inner-decension of into darth vader do not pack emotional jolt they should but won't just sat back theater twice enjoyed what saw . once you learn enjoy film without hanging its short-comings then you've begun develope your own opinions personal feelings cinema attack clones immensely hope see again soon because so much give 5 stars despite fact it's only worth 4
i think this is a quality movie . it has bit of everything- action , adventure and romance how could not be good with val kilmer tom cruise in ? it's an old that will always
the movie was absolute best.it funny had great graphics and a wonderful plot!it should deserve much better then what some of your reviwers are giving it i think you take ther reviews off !
star wars fans prepared to be dazzled and blown away by effects , some insight into the three original with awesome music of darth vader making one grin cheekily . this is visually spectacular storyline stays put throughout it has something for everyone i.e a spunky boy girls little skin guys any movie-lover talented actors (christenesen jackson mcgregor) side yoda i'm sure most people thought we would never see episode roller-coaster ride imagination however i feel romance aspect was well-played our young but in points you seem think it's an dramatic soap opera also both times watching film have noticed start takes through narrative (that time tell story) so action may not appear straight when does come smile from ear overall fabulous movie new-comer christensen setting mood pace evil
this movie brings back the magic , novelty and inrtigue of star wars that caught everybody when first came out (no you can't see it again for time that's impossible so move on) frankly is one greatest movies i've ever seen . here's skinny hayden christensen does an excellent job as anakin i hope to more him in other films future ewan's reprisal obi wan role better than his attempt he's growing into alec guinness version nicely but was amazed friendship we've imagined all these years between has nowhere near emotional impact wan's qui gon's had phantom menace natalie portman continues smuggle her awesome intelligence work under cover beauty forces us wonder what exactly fueling character's love it's clear from beginning film been sweating since last chapter reactions advances seem only you'd expect a very professional political figure getting lot sudden personal attention they are apparently facing death she tells loves too why with dark hints self seeping through talk both cleverly written neatly overlooked by characters emperor's guidance jedi career mentioned definitely power jar binks small he manage ensure destruction republic r2 3po have some their best moments mirroring 'empire strikes back' everyone thought would trashes ways nobody could expected lightsaber dueling also like 'esb' brilliant christopher lee giving lacked ; villain who active intelligent though action choreographed means here did old trilogy yoda gets groove on shows calls master sequences rather being over-the-top were necessary story should live up fan expectations started episode 4 reminiscing developments battle scenes copious gripping way feel darkness become mere faces crowds friendly clone troopers remind me aliens v before find they're evil note guy played jango fett kick ass well go moive enjoy : won't anything quite (probably till 3)
but it wearing on me , i've seen so many times . love the time loop
another solid futuristic sci-fi film from arnold . this time he goes to mars find out who brainwashed him , and liberate the mutants i know that sounds ridiculous but it's better than it
it's got romance , drama action and is so real . it easily could probably has happened
this movie is the greatest . not only did it revolutionize computer technology in film today , started trend had everything a science fiction fan could ever want : women sex adventure mystery and space travel tthe characters depicted portrayed themselves so well was jaw-dropping irreplaceable one of kind
the original terminator led way for cyber war movies . not one of those was able to compare t2!although it a sequel there no depletion originality
this is of course a sequel to space seed from the original star trek series . in that episode , kirk and enterprise gang find derelict ship with superhuman survivors hibernation these are revived they take over for bit but intrepid gets upper hand places them on primitive planet richardo montalban head khan movie chekhov an expedition make long story short lands same which group were banished takes then uses it almost destroy wily outfoxes due kirk's experience also meets his natural son whole new
seamless addition to the original series by continuing past origins with contemporary film techniques . arguably strongest of all 10 thus far , star trek ii : wrath khan set an undeniable precident for adherance superb acting and multi-syllabic language in a world fraught single syllable movies
this movie is good , especially how kirk out smarts the superhuman kahn . a funny character he smart has sense of humour and controlling
if not the best than at least one of trek films . in this they took an episode from series and did some thing creative with it i may like so much because first was bad great casting a superb story mr montaban made movie
after star treks version of fantasia in the first movie enterprise returns with a bang for greatest kickass federation classic all time .
spacefights rule .
this was the best of lot . montalban's energy made movie i always loved it when kirk squared off ship to against someone , and khan perfect nemesis a great action flick !
the most action packed star trek movie ever . they need more movies with ships doing battle
the only good thing to come from star trek universe since tribble .
easily the best star trek film for all obvious reasons . me part of that movie was interplay between kirk and khan they chew scenery with a side ham to point camp despite dialogue share is highlight khan...i'm....laughing atthesuperiorintellect
several trek movies have been bad , but not this one . i'd watch if it had nothing to do with the series at all ricardo mantalban drives movie
hands down , the best star trek film and an outstanding sci-fi in it's own right . ricardo montalban plays one of very villans i have ever seen on ; he's that good this is recommended to everyone not just fans (i wouldn't say about bulk material)
by far the best star trek and one of greatest sci fi all time , giving wars a run for its money .
the best star trek movie ever made . this film re-introduces kirk to an enemy from his past (and original series as well) ricardo montalban plays role insane khan excellently william shatner and leonard nimoy are in surprisingly good form , supported by usual cast if you not a trekie is want see should be your favorite unlike most films episodes actually has battle scenes rather entertaining
a great movie on many levels . first , wonderful then trek the pacing is you really undertand why kirk captain his tactics are fantastic khan makes villain this about conflict between old and young fathers sons fear of death growing friendship new beginnings blood guts war loss good vs evil special effects were ahead their time there distinct biblical reference milton's paradise lost clearly evident : genesis device carol in garden eden eating apple as jesus satan marshalling forces duking it out when they fight nebula whn enterprise at red alert blood-red backlight reminiscent hell's fire high adventure suspense an epic sweep what stunning montalban nimoy shatner's skill taking acting to big screen tng cast never could do that well
the most tightly-scripted and epic entry of lot .
one of the best star trek films ever !
i thought maverick was a pimp in this movie . love airplanes it sweet when his friend got killed
hands down the best trek film of all time .
this review is for the dvd directors cut edition . yes , it's a good movie nicholas meyer who directed sequel wanted to give naval feel and it works well james horner's score reinforces that nautical notably when enterprise clearing moorings flows with possible exception of genesis cave effects are great director cuts adds some scenes dialog we discover scotty's nephew crew member aboard ship william shatner's portrayal kirk probably one his best performances (if you listen commentary discusses he would make shatner do each take about 10 times so he'd lose hollywood swagger) loss spock however does end on somber note but still trek movies grace screen
one of the best trek movies , starting a quasi-trilogy in story that continues into 3 and 4 (though # is dominated by another plot) . good action decent acting high drama nice fx great score james horner
this is simply one of the best star trek movies ever . kirk and crew fight an old foe from past who takes chekov his captain hostage steal a federation starship on quest to device that can transform planets , course revenge against james t battle sequences are tense action-packed emotional scenes pack punch spacedock beautiful as usual ending shocking say least highly recommended for all !
the best star trek movie ever! ! this one has it all , and noone exept ricardo montobahn (i think i spelled that right) could have played role of khan . he was great khaaaann!!!
it doesn't get any better than this . shatner pushes to the edge and beyond in battle scenes , his reaction death of spock best lifelong friend a moment years making i think you either or don't so i'll stop commenting there
the best trek film . i don't know how it could be beaten kahn!!!!! !
khaaaaannn!!!! !
this movie is great , but then you have to be a trekkie fully love the series and movies . from black white up until next generation star trek bomb !
the greatest sci-fi movie ever made . a classic shakespearian story to futurisic theme it is 23rd century khan noonian sihn , geneticly engineered dictator from 1996 seeks revenge against starfleet captain and universe that betrayed him 15 years ago with weapon of unbelievable power genesis device crew starship hiding science team at stake including kirk's alienated son kirk must overcome all odds defeat an arch nemesis he thought had left behind riccardo montalban was great no one else could have played part leonard nimoy also when spock died touched every star trek fan everyone see this
imaginative and realistic , although sometimes slow . hands down the greatest sci-fi movie ever made
good theme . harrison ford is an assassin hired to kill androids who penetrate a quarantine and come back earth the of that time dark sinister place , lots weirdness occurs
one of the all-time underrated films virtually ignored when it was released in early 80's - just too dark and deep for movie audiences at time . luckily , has earned fame vhs dvd rentals ridley scott's best work since alien
isn't blade runner the most voted movie in this rating? ? i have mercy of you , american guys . perfect history cinema with soundtrack performances setting screenplay scenery and could go on... definite
one of the best all time
an absolute masterpiece . in my opinion , the finest movie ever made some have complained that it is slow but with jaw dropping visuals i strongly disagree scene where rachel being quizzed by deckart has got to be one of most sensitively filmed scenes history cinema incidentally when this came out early 1980's absolutely bombed think a testament perhaps on how far we come as society lovers takes pretty high level concentration and feel was way too subtle for audiences 80's generation since experienced phenomenal rental revenue dvd available now well enjoy..
in my opinion , perhaps the best movie of all time not just sci-fi genre . it is everything art cinema should be about - compelling story characters with depth and most importantly kind visuals that only can provide ridley scott for his fame still underrated also two things give more a first i think original cut harrison ford's narration equally as director's was part detective classic element second had bumbled around many years trying to find haunting soundtrack by vangelis apparently wasn't until 1994 some contractual dispute settled finaly released what this ones calibre would allow happen day age
atmospheric , savage witty and unsettling . a truly great movie
one of the most dark and gritty movies sci-fi genre , blade runner never ceases to impress . ridley scott's meticulous attention detail makes for great cinema cinematography is something behold besides that it has a script back up rutger hauer positively wicked as villian roy batty he best lines in movie history at edn film all my memories lost like teardrops rain time die harrison ford plays good foil hauer's insane villain he's seasoned pro deckart who doubt about what do replicants
hollywood sci-fi is usually spaceships , laser guns a hero love interest and some kind of chase scene or two . blade runner in its truest form that down to few factors firstly it was adapted from book do androids dream electric sheep ? by philip k dick man who knew nothing other than his paranoid vision the future regardless troubled personal life he wrote great secondly ridley scott genius can not only see mind how will work but has proved visual skills are what takes make movie time again (gladiator alien thelma louise) - then there people like hampton fancher syd mead harrison ford rutger hauer sean young etc add lot hauntingly beautiful musical score vangelis you've got basis for on top this you have carefully selected elements props lighting photography violence romance vehicles silence noise forms interactive ambience very films boast i lost count many times seen film everytime drags me fixates with morals questioning humanity general insecurity which perhaps winning ingredient deep we all ask ourselves real
one of the best!! !
one of the all time greats !
you need to watch the directors cut understand this brilliant film.the dream scene with unicorn is so important,and i,ve seen things people wouldn,t believe speach beautiful.a truly wonderful film brilliantly directed .
this film is absolutely amazing and for me it far superior than the book originated from (do androids dream of electric sheep by phillip dick) i grew up watching expect my kids will grow classics such as star wars too if have way . has an absolutly fantastic cast , hsrrison ford sean young reutger hauer daryl hannah many others its extremely dark not only with plot but sets well i'm going to rehash you can find out other comments that been made photography actors are convincing think helped make some them in industry vangelis' music gorgeous brings a great ambience still one best there was love making better majority movies were today - after all most films released now just thinking about how much money they at box office
the movie is a classic . cast of actors could not be better tom cruise and val kilmer are cool it belongs in everyone's collection
one of the absolute best movies all . great visuals , thought-provoking storyline ; score good acting and eminently quotable bit about replicants existentialism bring on special-edition dvd please !
this is a perfect film , in the director's cut and still worth 5 stars otherwise . its power lies raw humanity like book asking what it that makes someone human can an android sentenced to death for mass murder instance unable feel any emotions of own commit act which denoted empathy another living being ? how do you ecxplain if does movie indicts science with ignorance creates or tries imitate exposing arrogance overconfidence those responsible bringing replicants into attempting control lives created same system needs man deckerd hunt down androids when their time up monsters have outgrown creators yet him supposed justify his work never involves anything but such fall love one these are some questions evokes make not only visual masterpiece greatest single uses fiction medium
the director's cut has better end . every movie featuring cars hovering at verying levels robbed this one turmoil ford's character is dealing with internaly as interesting physical fights it's style and vision have been more influential on subsequent films than any of star wars serials
excellent storyline and visuals ahead of it's time . harrison ford as the main character was great pressures obstacles detective were clearly shown throughout movie
one of the best .
blade runner is an awe inspiring post-modern materpiece . it creates a bleak future composed of the bureaucratic elite and middled sleazy subterranean underworld (that looks lot like hong kong) where detective assigned on search destroy missions to eliminate replicas , or artificial humans disiguised for slave labor punch that packs account its sensitivity real concerns in contemporary society modern thought after while (played by harrison ford) has touble discriminating between people dilema seems far too time when great thinkers are proposing will only be matter before machines have consciousness
classic film from the 80s . it is a very soundtrack that all needed to say
this is a bad a*s movie !
blade runner is scifi at it's greatest . this film dark from the theme to sets incredible , subtle acting on parts of harrison ford daryl hannah rutger hauer and more raises question what does it mean be human ? imagery beautiful loaded with symbolism despite tone also touching hauer's last scene in one most life affriming scenes i've ever seen
this movie is an integral whole and one of the three movies could call 'good' . cinematography does more than just compliment , it creates story line brilliant
i recently watched this film on the sci-fi channel ; it had been a few years since last . one can determine how good movie is by well ages extremely , in same class as 2001 : space odyssey and forbidden planet its special effects premise are still believable definitely classic
excellent ! original fascinating harrison ford is great (as usual)
i'm definitely a sci-fi fan . think blade runner paved the way for new frontier in special effects
if you like murder , rape blood warriors and violence go rent this . is a family friendly movie that cheap babysitter crush your enemies see them driven before hear the lemantations of women  ! read next couple reviews for more insights
wow ! what an adventure this movie pretty much sums up life . conan is every man's hero , and woman's fantasy- which a few lucky ones fulfill barbarians wizards death sex epic battles cannabolism more could you ask for in must see anyone everyone show the whole family
the legendary warrior conan (schwarzenegger) begins his epic quest when conans mother was killed in front of him by thulsa doom , then he is sold for slavery . gets very huge and angry as pushes wheel pain at this point pissed off crum god finally released into wild (bad idea) takes over land seeks revenge death to have own kingdom with sex slaves laid quite a few times along journey only eats meat!! ! meets up valeria who also great but i'd like think that just kept her around peice ass kills horny witch way (erotic) crucified sneaks chamber all guard servants (james earl jones darth vader) chops head people throws it altar avenges goes on rule thats another story.....5 stars.. go rent blockbuster or hollywood before whacks your too
the all time best brutality movie.this is raw violence at it's best.nothing has come close since for me .
one of the best sword and sorcery movies ever ! gret battle scenes exotic surroundings
this is the only movie i know by heart . good action scenes too bad there aren't enough naked chicks fun for whole family , guess
classic ! first movie to get me interested in fantasy and sci-fi . the storyline kept involved there was a great story character development
arnold dominates with a big , badass sword . there is an nfl hero in it as well james earl jones
a great movie !
good fighting scenes . acion and drama intertwined together well great actors
i don't think this one was ever topped by batman forever , robin or maybe even returns . jack nicholson of course perfect tim burton makes an interesting film here : a comic book generally for children made into gritty dark cold with some true great action and acting can smile just like nicholson's joker should really buy ooh got live !
i think this was the best out of batman films produced . tim burton injected correct atmosphere and characters were fantastic second followed its example outstanding others make a mockery concept , therefore one will always be original ones
i think batman was cool . jack nicholson awesome as the joker it a perfect role for him kim basinger also great bruce wayne's girlfriend michael keaton an excellent
batman was one of my all time favorite movies because its originality and also classic comic appeal . i grew up with comics the movie portrayed a book feel this is why think it an original
eventhough this film is based on a comic book , movie was outstanding . it captured the story of well and also my (as as friends) eyes suitable for almost all ages which plus
batman has to be considered an absolute classic . a movie that uses just enough of the comics but combines real life attributes make seem almost possible cast including michael keaton , jack nichalson and kim basinger story one watch delivers big here course nicholson as joker steals show
batman has so many movies . i liked this movie a lot
this is the best movie of all time . there was a lot action lots suspense i impressed
micheal keaton did the best job of portraying comic book character . director kept original aspects batman while giving new and flavor first a four part series , this one set tone for rest jack nicholson does classic performance as villan special effects added to total fun
i really liked batman because he flies in the air and helps people . like it when fell love all kids too
tom cruise is so hot the movie !
this was a really good movie for comic book fans . the dark knight finally came to life on screen as other batman films , best i didn't like others much first
batman was the bomb when i little . how they made whole movie great think that is a will never die
batman was great . it a movie i had fun the best
tim burton's recreation of the classic comic introduces jack nicholson as sinister joker . one few superhero movies to actually do justice original
batman was just one of your typical superhero movies that you can enjoy . i thought tim burton did a good job on emphasizing the darkness batman's character
the first batman movie is by far best . michael keaton man for part
a thrill . my inner 10 yr old boy did cartwheels for months after seeing this movie
rocked! !
entertaining and fun to watch . solid script , special effects actiong overall much better than i expected it be
a great movie to watch . although the 2nd was bigger hit , i still think this set very good stage
this was an excellent movie . the emotion that is involved in it amazing musical score adds a third dimension to already great acting highly recommended
very well done . i grew up watching and reading x-men so was satisfied with how this the cast perfect one or two exceptions pleased that they decided to keep magneto's origin since is his main reason for despising mankind but like all comic book movies it wasn't exactly considering fictional characters have been turned into flesh abd blood actors easy forgive these faults expect same satisfaction from sequel
one of the best movies all time . cast : great actress playing dr.jean grey is very convincing she's a pretty woman , like lot women would to be girl rogue was impressive haven't seen her in many films but this she particularly good cyclops (played by james marsden) also him act so well other he's been last i will mentioning (but certaintly not least) hugh jackman wow stunned when saw heaven watching can life get any better than ? don't think amazingly talented and handsome that can't put it into words seriously love everything about his smile eyes hair body even nose ! man highly underrated should receive lots more attention am looking forward seeing he ever decides do heck someone you day wonderful built for close being perfect scares me i've said enough :o) sum up movie excelent special effects
coming from along time reader of the x-men comics , let me say that this film seriously exceeded all expectations . wolverine was perfect with one-liners true to his comic book counterpart although i think  ? would have been slightly better considering logan is meant look older than 30 not even healing powers could make him young weakest link [if there one] has be rogue too much her personality melded jubilees' meaning past books cant explored also didnt like way original members were made teenagers mean anyone currently up date will agree ice man one most interesting characters expansion new and yet here he spotty hormonaly charged hitting on who obviously just waiting for gambit get a call know need life but dont care ! i'm going go home watch again dvd
top gun is a classic that both men + women can watch and enjoy . definitely my favorite movie
first of all , let me start by stating that i have followed the marvel comic's x-men for quite awhile . think movie was excellent though some characters could been introduced and expounded on.. (such as storm).. over casting terrific ! would definitely recommend this to anyone with any interests in a good flic! am eagerly awaiting sequel!
it was the best movie that has ever came out in movies because other suck ! this is a message from biggest marvel comics fan
graphics are good . characters interesting and realistic movie reflects off the comic
great acting , costumes effects and plot . worth all $8 plus a nice shot of hugh jackman without his shirt for ages
if you love movies and comics , this is the perfect movie for . i thought that x-men had to be one of best year was just overwhelmed by all special effects how close comic book it worth my money see
top gun is the greatest movie ever made .
if you are familiar with the x-men comic book series , this is a great movie special effects and an exciting script .
i liked this movie because of the special effects and action scenes .
i just want to say , that this was one of the best movies have ever seen! ! been watching x-men animated series for 6 years now and movie excellent!! everything correct (according series) hope there will be another one!!.....to continued.... .
i loved it!!!! ! think wolferine is the bomb
i enjoyed the movie very much ! it was exciting . loved hugh jackman's potrayal of logan/wolverine wolverine had never been my favorite x-men (gambit has always x-man , a bit disappointed to hear his character would not be portrayed in movie) don't get me wrong like all but now thanks mr.jackman portrayal gave such sex appeal that if were jean grey could just set him aside any way fantastic!see you haven't (sorry gambit)
top gun is an all time great movie . one that will never get old
it was the best thing i've ever seen , but they should have more focus on jean grey in next one .
this movie is another example of a classic comic book excellently transformed into motion picture blockbuster . featuring characters from the , it good cleanly and solidly great though there are some clear disimilarities(wolverine much taller than his character rogue clearly younger she as portrayed in comic) many changes have been seen still consistently showing smooth transition to sequence
to take a comic and put it in onto the big screen lot of creative licence must be taken otherwise you get dodgy film . can't make believable , serious with people running around bright yellow spandex costumes were well done actors picked you've heard all good stuff already so.. 'nuff said
except for the costumes , i could not have been more pleasantly suprised at true x-men feel to this movie.an unknown actor like hugh jackman did wolverine about as good you can do . loved little previews of characters iceman and jubilee movie has me begging a sequel that will include new development current ones.check it out bub!!!! !
the movie x-men was great because story unusual and cast played their characters well . powers that each character had made more interesting than normal good looking help too
this movie totally rocked . it incorporated a diverse group of comic book characters and really used their different abilities to the extreme in end , left room for lot other be introduced which is cool
top gun was an all time action movie .
finally they made an x-men movie . it has great actors and a story i like how rogue dyed her hair this rocks
i loved this movie . if there was a 10 would give it the reason wsa that my brother and grew up as marvel comics kids knew when they made an x-men , be best of all time !
great special effects . the movie was missing some characters but action and made up for it
it is the most tight ass movie there . should win an oscar they come out with a part two are enemies in world that compared
top gun was a great movie . tom cruise's finest hour meg ryan is hottie mix of action and sex
x-men is the best movie of summer by far . effects were cool and didn't mess up storyline
i grew up collecting x-men cards and comic books , so when saw the movie it was really exciting . thought good
i loved this movie . used to watch x-men every saturday morning ! when heard they were making a got so excited it was better than thought
x-men was a good ass movie , and it stayed enough with the comic book .
good plot . characters played out used to love x-men six years ago i thought the movie would suck but was drawn back into it
it's just a great guy movie . fast planes , cool cars hot girl saves country
this was an outstanding movie . action picked up at the very end i thrilled throughout good actors storyline
this movie was awesome . i usually think comic book movies are okay but x-men just great didn't have to know everything about the get costumes were and so
i thought x-men was the best movie of summer . special effects were outstanding story line kept me excited and intrigued entire time
i've been a big fan of the comic and cartoons for while now but never thought movie would do it justice . after seeing i was wrong personally found to be great watch that fun not only did enjoy so others went with they knew absolutely nothing about x-men before this film that's why such success , you don't have ( hugh jackman )
exiting , cool graphix
the movie stayed pretty close to comics and special effects were good . ending left story for a sequel which i will definitely see cast of actors was great they did job portraying their characters
braveheart is one of my most favorite movies . it a quality action thriller long , but there never dull moment i loved the story and character mel gibson played he was perfect guy to star in movie
i went to the theater expecting a total bomb but after two hours actually thought movie was worth watching . wolverine made whole it is
wolveraustin in canada great movie
the movie completely baffled me by its special effects . characters were astoundingly like cartoon i have to admit that may been lost in who if my boyfriend hadn't come along
a great movie with two actors . patrick stewart and ian mcklellan were superb they play good guy bad the way it should be action young i can't wait for sequel
i absolutely loved this film . was somewhat weary of it as so many people kept on branding a bad remake the original when actually they were wrong is based ideas and pays homage to
i thought x-men was a good movie because of all the action scenes and pretty interesting plot . acting from characters
i liked this movie a lot . it had good storyline and the actors did nice job has potential for sequel
i thought it was probably one of the best movies i've seen this hole year ! had a great....no wait an awesome start and ending unlike all other , great start..but then its like fvcking writer fell asleep at end think x-men movie reeks awesomeness for ones that sucks well....no takes advise from someone watches richard simmons workout tapes put up pictures mr.rogers on there wall enough to tilt trailer have very nice day...or night whatever xmen rule!!!!
it was an awesome action-adventure movie . not having previous knowledge of the comic books didn't hinder my enjoyment futuristic , but too cheesy action great because wasn't hoaky
this movie appealed ot the younger side . computer graphics and special effects were good it had a message there great actors makes you want to read comics see sequel
great actors and director . this movie has super effects it is applicable to the comic series
i really loved this movie ! have seen it four times and still want more can't wait for the sequel .
thank god that after the last few batmans and stallones protrayal of judge dread , hollywood has been able to actually portray a comic book on screen . fighting between wolverine cyclops was realistic hilarious i can not wait for next one come out
this is the best movie i have ever seen . has great effects and a drmatic (but funny) plot line am going to bye it when comes out on video/dvd see now!!!!!!! !
great action movie with pretty people to look at & enjoy :) ! especially mark walhberg
this was the best movie i have seen in a long time ! it's action packed and full of surprises! once you see it , you'll be hooked for sure!! here's hoping there will sequel! ^_^
i love this movie ! found the special effects to be awesome . casting and acting was good story fun
the x-men was best movie ever!! !
a great job of being as true to the comics possible without making silly movie . good guys work together really well
as a comic book fan...i loved it...and yet it had enough drama and action to draw non- fans in . isn't that what this movie should do?? ? the geek stuff thrown for i think gave background allow everyone enjoy....can not wait sequal
i love this movie . can't stand it what happened to logan,rogue,and everyone else did logan come back rogue give the dogtag or let her keep ?
a bit twisted compared to the comics , but who wouldn't love superhero stories ?
an excellent movie . the graphics are incredible plot explains origins of each important x-men its drama is a bit lengthy , but it sets up story for action packed sequel
i thought this movie was great . liked the action scenes and found it very entertaining do have one criticism for though , did not feel that background developed enough
another masterpiece in spielberg's massive collection of great titles.e.t . is an 80's icon
i love 'heist' movies , and this one did not disapoint . there are so many spoilers can barely describe the film but i'll give it a try : heist plot twist con job edward norton gets cold cocked -- twice! motorboats racing through canals of venice few great car chases cool ending it's in theaters anymore rob your grandma's purse if you have to go rent movie ! don't turn off computer.. now
e t was one of the best movies ever . music great , a plot line and effects were excellent scenes toward end while make you want to cry those beginning are scary i like 2002 20th anniversary special edition version better than original
one of the best family films all time . i laughed cried , and if you didn't really aren't human this film goes far beyond realm science fiction touches heart any individual even today am impressed to see such a lasting no other has ever come close what attempted succeeded at
very good . i would recomend it to anybody check out
i loved this film , it was the best ever
steven spielberg's best work - a classic
the all time classic , above everything else . it hasn't lost any of it's magic since was first released back in 1982 so good performances steven spielberg and with effects team john williams' score created a !
what a wonderful family movie . i saw this for the first time almost 20 years ago in one of those huge theaters they used to have moving , funny story about boy and his friedship with an extra terrestrial who is named e.t three children try keep e.t.a secret after short while wants go home.so kids find way him communicate planet course when that public finds out tries take so can experiment on him.the friends rescue get ship just real feel good friendship between elliot all kid actors are drew barrymore was adorable had me laughing.and crying.a well done
wondeful movie . it's just a classic the best ever made acting , music and direction are fantastic forever !
this movie is the best that i have ever seen . it had a good storyline , and also touched everybodies heart was overall
i loved the movie . it was a warm hearted , caring about stranger from another planet wanting to go home drew barrymore great in
at first i thought , oh it's gonna be another mobster movie  but it truly was not ! great . loved
one of the greatest movies ever made . brought forth a feeling that we are not alone sort like orson wells radio broadcast aliens attacking
i watched this movie again a year or so ago and it was still great . by now , everyone has probably seen but if you haven't in while do yourself favor rent won't be disappointed
a sweet movie which makes me think of childhood . oddly , i just found out yesterday that the little girl in et was drew barrymore - did anyone else not know ?
any movie that gets you all choked-up about a sappy alien is worth 5 stars ! i'll admit it , i cried when thought e.t . was dead
yeah - b**** and rant all you want but this movie is great .
despite goneaway and gentle jude's dismissal (without even having read the books or seen movie , but based on a rumour that they promote withcraft satanism things like (which we all know is not true . most of us were already into stuff before came out!))of potter fantastic it stays to book as much possible nice visual introduction world harry casting was damn near perfect you can really believe daniel rupert emma are ron hermione quidditch scene visually breathtaking great special effects throughout make for one ijr says don't listen check this out yourself if want whole family enjoy
i have read the book and see movie . both were great was pleased to that they followed so closely anyone who will not watch or harry potter because think witchcraft is evil , my grandfather a devoted southern baptist preacher has all books seen far produced loves them finds stories be wonderful creation of fantasy those nah-sayer what's next boycott wizard oz at least half disney movies ever created burn david copperfield alive it's story good one !
excellent movie,as true to the book as possible without being 8 hours long .
i have read all 4 books ! and when the movies came out. . they jus kept gettin better even more because its a story with imagination , magic adventure will always love it
this movie not only has action but romance and comedy . mel gibson does a compelling role as passionate scottish man putting his life on the line for freedom country against british was beautifully done with amazing scenes of scotland talented cast it shows war from perspective their fight touches heart makes you respect scots bravery
loved it . was a good introduction into the world of harry potter and is faithful to book in most aspects cast did great jobs also scenery hogwarts itself were wonderful , it's like entering an entirely different for duration film
i have not read any of the harry potter books , but did need too . i've seen first two movies and they are masterpieces will go down in history as classics movie is a pure cinematic gem that take you into world wonderment awe daniel radcliffe superb who can act just well veteran actors he's working with which include maggie smith alan rickman robbie coltrane rex harris other child rupert grint emma watson delight story terrific about boy grew up rather abusive home discovers he something special only more than doesn't flaunt it or abuse there great deal humanity effects leave characters memorable it's one want to watch again
i thought this movie was so cute , could watch it over and again . the entertaining from beginning to end never a dull moment
dont know what people are thinking when they say that this movie was well made and very enjoyable to watch .
if you have to take your kids see a hyped up movie , this is what want . delightful !
not just a film for kids . this one can be enjoyed by all ages it's fairly faithful to the original story , and actors are wonderful in their roles most importantly they look like having great time special effects too only realistic but also serve instead of overshadow it deal about satanism--forget there
loved it , the characters were great and i can't wait until next installment !
wicked
great movie ! didn't see it ill after came out on video but i thought was . loved the books and just a little bit less exciting then book probably because before origional is usually better still think awesome
i was wowed by the effects , and having read books felt that they stuck to storyline as well possible in order tell story a timely matter . attention detail of scenery such hogwarts diagon alley amazing astors were equally cast it is an enchanting movie for children adults
i saw the movie before got into books , so perhaps that's why loved it . was original imaginative funny and.. british i've always been fascinated with brits and think decision to have a cast right one kept feel of actors were superb ! course they left some things out but there would be no way every single detail fit 2 1/2 hour film anyway this led me read all i'm now potter freak
it is a must see movie . i was one of the many others that standing in line on opening night just to if lived up its hype did very impressed true book and graphics were alot better than imagined this will definitely be my dvd collection when comes out
pure magic , that s what this movie is . i read all four books and loved the story so couldn t wait to see when finally saw it spent most of time delighted with adaptation - which very good a fabulous cast does wonfderful job in giving life harry potter his world
that was a really great movie ! i thought it might be another one of those movies didn't live up to the book based on , but in relation important details were left out itself loved and can't wait for next
fantastic ! one word describes it all
i would have preferred the film to be twice as long , but all in cuts are justified - especially far weakest part of book i.e . first few chapters (too kitsch) concerned casting is excellent coltrane hagrid ideal for instance spite tendency choose actors and (in case emma watson hermione at least) actresses which too good-looking a particularly glaring ist alan rickman severus snape now am not kind persons who gets crushes on still.. four volumes decribed positively revolting just ugly quite unappetizing references his greasy hair abound suppose make-up people could provided with sallow skin an abnormally nose they certainly didn't so why did rowling him anyway understand she ? because silky voice proffers sarcastic comments or realized that p.g.wodehouse put it pigs wings  nothing scary dressy assassin has changed her mind about new improved (beyond recognition fact) extremely convincing well elegant austere way hope if kills off (and sneaking suspicion will eventually) least wait until end last volume
excellent movie! ! i normally can't sit through a movie that long but the time just flew by with this - it was great!
this is one of the best movies out . when it first came i was those people who like oh god  , more harry potter but very surprised loved cause its not just a kids movie still though dont understand say makes want to practice witchcraft also tells lies well c'mon fairytale type book that means some things in are gonna be fake fairytales adults heard they were little everyhting stories true anywayz....its really good reccomend going see if you wanna spend money for theaters (cause so expensive now) rent comes on video surprisingly good!!some parts arent all part cant believe swore huh what did he ? :) main girl (cant think her name right cute !
lucky enough to see it the night before opened . i loved is amazing how some of things in movie looked exactly as imagined them diagon alley for example was almost a perfect match , gringott's hogwarts itself very different from what but cool moving staircases ! actors all perfectly conveyed their characters and especially liked daniel radcliffe emma watson rupert grint harry hermione ron robbie coltrane hagrid wonderful they could not have picked better dumbledore or snape do only one concern though book about 150 pages 2.5 hours.. happens when we get goblet fire at 750 ? highly recommend this
i found this movie very entertaining . it was the best work that christopher columbus has done in a long while , with beautiful sweeping cinematography(as someone mentioned before think) inspired casting and great special effects having never read books i'm sure missed lot(as one always does when they see adapted from book or something of sort.) but still charming would recommend highly to anyone who enjoys films cute mindless persuasion wanna be wizard (not witch..i will transcend unfair gender stereotypes.)
what a beautiful movie . it's as fun like 'goonies' but lot more intelligent vehicle for any kid's dreams ; finding out one day you have magic powers , and getting whisked away from your humdrum life to world where everyone's on awe of adventure intrigue are everywhere visually perfect the characters totally believable considering unreality their situations i haven't read books number complaint hear those who is that too many details nuances make rowlings such great writer don't reach screen understand there faithful novels it was than enough me quidditch match has been compared pod race in star wars ep 1 while i'm die hard fan think loads better must see
great movie!! !
it was better than the first because setting up story so teh second had more action . kinda like episode iv and v from star wars i also loved nightcrawler x3 is coming out in may update : not see since have heard they he one of best movie do a wolverine which means slice dice
better than the first !
it rocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
better than the first one . i am not a superhero cartoon fan never read any comics but think this movie is lot of fun and even if you don't like those kind movies , might wanna try out it really good
very good and actually better than the first one . way more action a lot depth to story if you are fan of comics will get out this fun movie must see
this movie is cool fun to see whith some freinds .
the first x-men movie was plain awful . it didn't even stay true to either comic book or cartoon and i so disappointed where jubilee , gambit beast ? walked away feeling that just witnessed a poor episode of washed up sci-fi tv programme x2 however gave me pleasure sitting in my seat five minutes after finished with eyes still rolling from visual feast fresh character development good special effects story few minor glitches (the absence rogue her romance iceman when really should have been gambit) managed overlook these small flaws appreciated
i feel that the 2nd movie is way better than first . computer graphics are much more indepth and plot kept you on edge of your seat
awesomely great sequel , surpassing the first . cast is incredible packed with actors like patrick stewart ian mackallen famke janseen and halle berry special effects are making action sequences even better dialogue there some good touches of humor ending was also very cool movie !
great movie . better than the first
one of the best movies i've seen in theatres a long time . as i tell everyone who asks me , it's movie all year you don't need to see first like this though i'd x-men 1 too and liked it quite bit is actually better than at least my opinion
wow
amazing effects.. . and the ending was great i hope they'll bring in more characters next movie;)
ten times better than the first one .
excellent movie . you didn't even need to have seen the first one enjoy it amazing special effects i enjoyed this more than matrix 2-reloaded !
was a simple outstanding movie. . the action awesome. effects when nightcrwler apparates is simply too good to describe. story gripping. ending totally unexpected
i like it . very entertaining
this movie is the best ive seen in a looonngg time ! it 20x better than first(dont get me wrong , i loved 1st one) x-men something whole family would love loaded with action romance comedy everything!the beginning starts off an amazing scene thw white house left breathless when stopped . film and was even 2nd saw it- its just filled great actors sets awesome animation hope you chance to see
this movie was awesome...way better than the first . i can't wait for 3rd one to come out !
this movie was well done in my opinion . had some great action sequences and other satisfying moments i enjoyed seeing pyro retalliate against the police magneto's escape from his plastic prison also a memorable moment it got little cheesy towards end ending promises sequel but bad thing is that you have to wait couple more years find story's conclusion
it was better than the first !
one of the best movies year
way better than the first one.. . alot more action.. and i don't even like comics.. until saw movie :)
this movie completely rocked ! once it comes out on dvd i'll probably watch like 10 times
clearly the greatest action/super hero pic . of all time up to current movies !
the minute i sat in that cinema seat , became a child again.. . and loved it ! far from saying film is for kids as many political undertones cultural references are clearly aimed at an older audience most probably people like me who grew up with x-men don't mind slipping back into our childhood two hours seeing imaginations portrayed on big screen die hard comic book fans do have to realize very different medium so concessions sacrifices be made painful they (gambit) thoroughly enjoyed reliving easy days can't wait next one
never a dull moment . i want to be mutant !
i thought it was really good.very entertaining imo
great movie that those who only look at the surface won't see depth of . it is type has flash for don't get either way you will probably like in end , understand where third going unless have never read a single x-men comic watched cartoon ect they once again focused more on wolverine than other merry mutants however some fan favorites made cameos which least one fairly happy
in a way its cornball now . but i loved it , and think great classic
classic eddie murphy movie about a convict who has 48 hours to help cop get the bad guys . great action , and is hilarious as always this birthplace of line there's new sheriff in town his name reggie hammond
there were good people in the cast : dreyfuss , dillon garr etc . i have to admit liking almost everything he does--he is a likeable actor say same for and use of musical notes very clever all it great piece entertainment
one of the top sci-fi movies all time . ranks right up there with et , jaws and star wars richard dreyfuss is marvellous spielberg flexes his powerful directing muscles! !
you'd have to be an adult , i think truly appreciate this film but it's a great movie . man miss movies from the 70s early 80s - directors really put their asses into them i'm not fan of spielberg's work after duel  jaws and one all superb love story it is very well-constructed wonder incites how dreyfuss drops his wife (although garr's hottie) hooks up w/ lady he can better relate admire message leaving planet so fearless about like life wasn't on earth in first place now that older reunion kid single mom gets me as when he's taken by visitors she runs out house screaming for her son use color sentimentality went overdrive lost (can't stand et) was still making adults here shows
this is a film for all ages . i remember when saw it , not to long ago and still day an impressive movie spielberg really knows what he doing puts his magic into true classic you feel the charectors during
spielbergs perfect science fiction film . stunning special effects , sound and cinematography are uniformly excellent the best of its genre 1970's! ! great story fantastic music
close encounters is one of speilberg's greatest films . this the that really popularized alien/government conspiracy phenomenon these were bold , fresh ideas when film came out even after multiple viewings still compelling it exciting funny frightening whimsical and exhilirating writing acting musical score directing are all superb
i don't know if it follows the book or not . is hard to read because of need glossary movie avoids this some extent but still unglossed jargon creeps in
alex -- ahhh.. .
great satire and a poignant message - the alex character is memorable.. .
one of the best films in history . also directed movie ever there's nothing else like it.. it kicks major ass
funny , good action plausible plot . great casting nick nolte plays a straight man
as nasty a movie was ever made . nobody in this is even slightly likeable brilliant performance by mcdowell alex i love it
stanley kubrick is great . this movie weird but it was
my second favorite movie of all time and what a great one ! wonderfully twisted , smart funny . i love the irony(violence mixed with happy song) they may have over done it nudity but that doesn't matter acting this is mispercieved by many people main idea about society wants us to be machines remember we are still human that's title best movies
my all time favorite movie ! pure kubrick satire and surrealism . funnier than any road trip or scary could even dream of alex delarge is played perfectly by malcolm mcdowell i wish watch it for the first over again
this was a great rendition of book . the mood , story music and acting all fit together it violent but contained an important message while pushing envelope
i would not go as far to call this film kubrick's masterpeice but it is by one of his most note worthy accomplishments . a very exciting and thoughtful movie about strange equally beautiful ugly future too from ours being the story boy whose principal interests are rape,ultra-violence beehtoven stinger sentence poster summation young named alex who lives in above mentoned where laws earth aren't really paid much attention because everyone focused on living outer space he enjoys hanging out with droogies beating,raping drinking milk laced narcotics until night caught you have see classic believe what happens watch for 2001:a oddessy record store highly recommended
a movie very closely written to the book . ultra-violence clearly conveyed human nature and truth of violence shown in was satisfying
arguably one of stanley kubrick's most exciting movies , a clockwork orange violently takes on the ideas morality and sensitivity . while obscene scenes (which helped to ban movie for couple decades) show how main character becomes too sensitive like crime rape viewer desensitized vice versa this also shows evil impulses transcends who people seem be
i liked it . a nice slice of british life actually great piece sci-fi , that's why it's in this category
not for the faint hearted , but perhaps best portrayal of modern-societal trends and undertones . is our world so different from kubrick's ? very scary in a contemplative way
the definitive classic cult thriller . kubrick at his best , with great music acting and plot it is graphic insightful meaningful mostly accurate to boot though as a warning not for faint of heart
clockwork orange was the first british cast movie i'd seen and it so crazy to me . if i a kind of person that did drugs like lsd acid stuff , watch all time every event happens in is wild when they broke into old couple's home main guy reformed went back same try live there
i think would consider this more of a comedy than an action/thriller movie , but either way it was great . eddie murphy's first role and kicked off as good start to career anyone has had (after 48 hrs there trading places beverly hills cop) murphy nick nolte were excellent team unfortunately they decided get back together for another which awful
i love this movie , a very dark futuristic story of government brain tampering . it really shows how we can go too far especially like all the characters' psychotic visions and ultra-violence
a classic . the use of colors is especially inspired more warped and decadent view society hard to come by
classical music will never be the same again . this is one of greatest psychological thrillers i've ever seen
very much like the book , and a classic movie . though lacking last chapter (which they took out of american version book) it is still good
one of kubrick's best movies , in which you see a crazy young man with no limits .
aging , but still very disturbing  !
unbelievable film (if you can get through the most graphic and violent scenes within first 20 minutes!) those beginning are unlike any other i have seen in a movie , however they necessary to film..this is an amazing look into criminal mind . it hard explain severity honesty that kubrik conveys this classic
one of the best movies early 70s , and clearly stanley kubrick's masterpiece . a wild upsetting shocking exploration violence don't rent this movie if you're easily offended but interested in an extremely well-made that offers no easy answers give it shot
a powerful film , little understated which makes it more effective .
stanley kubrick's greatest film about beethoven , rape and milk cookies bars . the most disturbing images i have ever seen on screen ; along with shining 2001 this is a must see for any enthusiast
a classic .
still one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.do not bother with remake-it is inferior to max !
i didn't think much of the planet apes by looking at it until watched this flick for first time a friends house . excellent story line , far ahead it's
powerful . gripping horrifying for a true study into man's inhumanity to man , the killing fields will not disappoint startling images of khmer rouge's rise power in 1970s cambodia combined with story bond friendship make most provocative war movie ever made
wow . an amazing movie which touchs on the human race and its moronic self-destructive ways less civil than damn apes i had extreme displeasure of seeing this more or back to with new one (with makers mark.) saddening how foul industry has turned really dont understand still have some hope but then again , all morons around...i doubt it
i was extremely surprised by how great this movie is . thought it just going to be one of those role reversals with white people being slaves and stuff like that what caught me off guard the ending meant in time made really good
one of my favorite movies all time with actors . the sequels are terrible , but this movie's social commentary seems to be unplanned while being ever present film's plot is well developed and charlton heston's character shows some development most apes lacking in that respect rod serling's work on film was fantastic it not able hold book which a far more sophisticated society than movie has great quality could duplicated todays cinematic climate if you liked twilight zone will for costumes makeup state art at very bad nothing postitive can said were simply form profit from original each becoming cheaper stories thinner
experience charleston heston at his greatest when he utters the words , leave him alone you damn dirty ape ! better than ben-hur plays a marooned space captin confused about what planet has landed on . question is not where but and with creepy twilight zone ending this movie rates 5 bananas
a true , unique classic  !
a classic . people talk about sixth sense having great surprise ending , but i think that it pales in comparison to the horror on charlton heston's face when he realized truth planet of apes flick - and who was actress played his mute companion ? she may be one only actresses from any old movie is smoking hot by today's standards
i saw this film at the premier in 1968 on wide cinerama screen- was 16 years old . stunningly presented- and one of most iconic films freaked out 1960s 37 later has not lost any its original verve special effects are still incredible
a real dramatic war movie which chronicles the life of vietnamese journalist as he escapes viet cong . scene when is in river with skeletons massacre victims my favorite most suspenseful whole
a masterpiece . my favorite science-fiction and philosophy film ever (well , how many are there really?) i presume everyone knows that if you add one to all the letters in hal get ibm .. kubrick's films always full of subtleties like see new things this every time it have never tired has something moby dick its epic heroic scale
this movie is a good one to test how intelligent person really . anyone who thinks too intellectual , boring slow or any other negative critique simply an idiot some religious people are probably turned off by the evolution idea perhaps my 2nd most favorite ever made it influenced planet of apes star wars close encounters aliens etc in terms technical achievement and trek (orig series) philosophical tone all sci-fi after until such as silent running space 1999 great i fell love with dawn man sequence just floors me - always feels like i'm there witnessing our ancestors' daily struggles monolith can be interpreted many ways symbol ingenuity ? probe from alien civilization final hyperspace at first couldn't tell if represented mind trip physical it's actually both starchild represents past future that's what about where mankind came we we're headed you think middle section seems because life despite technology around us becoming more machine-like while machines life-like happening conspiracy hal's hidden agenda you're observant note american flag symbolizing america's predominance during dr heywood's briefing absolute secrecy monolith's existence see time kubrick's movies shining frames scene explains sordid history hotel nicholson full metal jacket strangelove suggest disdain for country since he became expatriate anyway 2001 not that difficult worth repeated viewing but guess will never truth high art perfect saw haven't even talked effects obvious another knows what's up music light moving image
# 2 on my list . everyone else's more positive comments pretty much cover what i have to say for this movie
very confusing , i had to watch it a bunch of times get the story line but once did loved this movie . only for smart people kubrick has way doing that scariest i've ever seen and wasn't horror not feel good like keeps you thinking(if have sense enough stay awake) great though
not a film to suit all tastes.many (understandably)found it confusing and pretentious,and had difficulty identifying with the cast-its robot hal does seem most human character,while dialogue is hardly exciting.yet is,i think,the awe-inspiring english-language achievement in of cinema.i will never forget effect first viewing on me.it monumental its concept,scope ambition,an unsurpassed visual experience- which is,surely,the essence film.the special effects are superlative(this was back 1968!)and hugely influential,the set design staggering,the use music inspired,the stargate sequence dazzling trip wondrous new destiny.and there's famous,audacious single cut history.more appreciated outside america -it only from previous 30 years make top 10 sight sound's last major international poll,and has featured ever more strongly others- reaches for stars,and continues expand.see big screen be amazed .
great movie ! somewhat confusing , though unless you read the book . i can see why some people hate it only reason unnderstand is because
stanley kubrick's masterpiece ! that's all i gotta say
i didn't even begin to understand 2001 until read the book and watched it a few times . but all came me felt enlightened genius film once makes sense
this movie is one of the most powerful films i have ever seen . will never get those images out my mind fact that it based on a true story makes all more disturbing
classic movie about the dangers of leaving space missions to bureaucrats . script is awesome book made a wonderful
watching this movie is analagous to listening modernist classical music or observing a painting by picasso . the film work of art and i find myself reflecting upon it occasionally works on level popular sci-fi an exsistential puzzler
although this film requires a good attention span , it is well worth . the implications of symbolism are thought provoking one deals with essence humanity ; where did we came from going what our place in universe exciting sometimes frightening and disturbing special effects were stupendous for it's time they changed standard sci-fi industry
a classic . from the beginning to end , you're absorbed in kubrick's spell opening sequence alone is worth rental price
my name is dave . the first time i ever saw 2001 was with friend david h and k trying acid for , but they had it before as soon hal started saying what are you doing ? we all freaking out great
ever since it's release , raiders has been the gold standard to which action movies have aspired .
are there any better movies in this one . well if you like the gladiator will brave heart is a very touching movie which gave even my father tear eye see it!!! !
the bourne supremacy was my favorite movie of 2004 . identity a great , and there lot hype for i think sequel lived up to probably even surpassed first i'm already looking forward ultimatum which is scheduled be made in next few years
2001 is on of the most extraordinary films all time especially if you see it profected big screen w/ good sound .
wow , what a powerful movie ! the music still gives me chills .
so rocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
good movie i like the rain seen .
this movie was good!..does not compare to the second one thats for sure! !
oh spiderman . such a wonderful movie great graphics i want to fly like that tobey maguire , kiersten dunst they all did really well this had have been hard make the technology was put into it but worth can't wait for 2  ! *whispers with power comes responsibility*
a fantastic piece of work . like comic book but without the reading stays true to except for few minor parts that only obsessed would stress over sets bar at whole new level movies
never having been a big fan of superhero movies , i was quite impressed with this one . the movie ended me being satisfied toby mcguire perfect choice to play nerdy peter parker who is bitten by spider transforming him into super hero william defoe also green goblin love movie's comical scenes too as well its sad ones and story between mj (typical stuff) great movie- best ever be based on comic books !
saw this pretty soon after it came out and i really enjoyed . thought the computer graphics were great casting of characters much up there storyline was well executed easy to understand enjoy si something that people shouldn't take too seriously just !
when i went to see spiderman it had only been released a couple of days . was very crowded and seemed me that the theater filled with two different groups people half crowd never read comic book , knew absolutely nothing about characters other way too much spidey be healthy before movie started said my wife one audience or would have disappointed if were deep enough impress experts over heads novices could not more wrong whole entertained everyone enjoyed is 90% true remember seeing this advertised in theaters september attacks those early promos they showed an amazing scene where spun web between twin towers caught helicopter after movie's release held up all scenes removed some day future wounds heal like original version compare what
i have to say that this is one of the best movie adaptations a comic ever seen . characters are realistic , and effects were amazing
now this is more like it . finally a superhero movie that actually resembles the comic books god i loved have to tell everybody out there already one of my all-time favorite movies if spider-man your please you see
i thought that x-men would be the best comic book movie ever made , but was proven wrong . this is simply amazing very impressed with way it presented and stayed mostly true to can't wait for released on dvd
i've recently dubbed this the greatest super-hero movie i have evern seen . second , being equally entertaining x-men spidey has all action and origin intrigue of a great hero film as well some superbly directed shots tobey mcguire is clearly fantastic choice exuberant yet nedry shy peter parker willem defoe frightening in general he's much worse green goblin also another benefit having these actors smart way which they pull off typically comic book dialogue both defore give classy weight...as does kirsten dunst one can hope style making will be constant throughout budding spider-man franchise....unless bolts or get joel schumaker to direct should fine
the whole reason why i went to it was because of kirsten but after seen movie thought that very well done , entertaining and toby did a good job as . show
what a shocker ! this is one of the few movies that has actually exceeded hype . must see i can't wait for incredible hulk in 2003
fun movie for whole family
i absolutely loved spider-man ! to me , it is the best of all comic book movies ever made . (yes even better than superman!) tobey maguire was a bold choice on director sam raimi's part but he nailed kirsten dunst very good as mary jane watson however only critique that she always seemed much more self-assurred in movie and called pete tiger  guy playing triple-j awesome him perfectly willem dafor great for gobby highly recommended (for indepth review by please go www.overtime.blogspot.com)
the best comic adaptation ever ! it's just like reading comics from beginning to end . stan lee really made sure this film would be a mirror image of storyline it portrayed green goblin saga perfectly (especially ending) great acting (even by portayed newcomer toby mcgwire) very realistic as well movie shows peter parker having learn and perfect his superpowers instead knowing them in an instant he also moves gracefully (as should) i only have one complaint originally series , spider man's webs were shot out through special machines created wrist solid all way that's reason why is sold at every theater
one of my most watched movies . being part a fire dept makes you little more drawn into like this i guess can sit down and watch it at least once week
you know what screw if don't like this movie get on the imdb message board and trash
the star wars franchise strikes back with a vengenance phantom menace . featuring young obi-wan and his trainer , they fight new enemy named trade federation special effects are amazing from space battles droid pod racing humor is provided amusing jar-jar binks characters well fleshed-out have memorable dialogue great ending movie overall second in only to attack of clones
an excellent thriller with outstanding cast . the effects are awsome a good candidate for imax redo
the perfect introduction to satr wars saga ! lightsaber duel between qui-gon jinn , obi-wan kenobi and darth maul was great so pod racer scene
palpatine is the phantom menace,he genius , i said this in 1999 when everyone was bitching about how weak movie and that darth maul cool but got killed off . 1977 george lucas he did middle part of his saga first because it area most actioned oriented likely to be a hit well right made alot money gained loads respect as filmaker now with new star wars films able tell more events lead up what happened three movies these are not exciting from action standpoint important without all political stuff them none would have focal point downfall republic rise empire takes place senate battlefield one thing can say menace only makes me want know who running show here jedi emperor failed hold my interest showing do learn far worse than any villans aside boba fett favorite character look under surface superior even
cool visual effects , i can't wait fo da next one
i am not even a star wars fan and absolutely love this movie . don't understand why people dislike for the simple fact that it has lot of special effects think enchanced made things look more realistic myself original films probably would have had computer-generized back then if they technology to do so admit , acting's great...especially with little boy who plays anakin but by no means prevented me from enjoying movie...i go see movies judge on their acting skills only big distraction was jar binks...he just plain annoying in theaters breath-taking during pod racing scenes got goosebumps...the rumble roar incredible can bad-mouth as long want can't deny lightsaber battle at end is one coolest ever saw music...oh man music stunning buy soundtrack right after john williams an excellent composer his use chorus film really always signaled hidden danger triggered sense badness lurking about thing like anyone sit down actually enjoy know front empire strikes get into movie...a aren't sci-fi stuff bored quickly never seen before liked my mom enjoyed watching doesn't all high-tech lingo other movies...that gets while especially you idea what are talking anyways great favorites wait next ! peace out :)
great ! i love star wars
i loved the action packed and cool special effects .
it's star wars ! phantom menace could've been jar binks humming the theme from love boat for 2 hours and i still would've given it a 5 . don't know single person that only paid to see once most 3-7 times myself would never reveal how many in theater , because i'd be setting up as biggest loser on earth let's just say saw somewhere between 1 26 do math yourself
all i got to say- darth maul . this guy is the tightest sith there he has a double lightsabre that enough ?
bashed by critics for bad acting and lousy dialogue , this prequel is as good the first three movies with better special effects to boot . characters are just thin but that was never point
although not as powerful the original 3 movies , lucas does a great job with special effects and scenery in this movie . landscape to mention natalie portman are beautiful all other cast members liam nesson ewan mcgregor ray parks perfectly casted jar binks however deserves die
i saw this movie three days ofter the release on may 19 , 1999 it blew me away . went home after and next day couldn't help but tell everyone how great was all of acting by liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman rey park gave you a good sense surroundings should interact with actors desert scenes old faces (liam neeson) that's work fight darth maul his dual-bladed lightsaber versus qui-gon obi-wan prompted to go again music excellent feeling for action best 4 star wars movies
a well made movie depicting that past of country and the life man (william wallace) . struggles hardships he went through for this his freedom personal story makes it easier to understand history people
best...carchase...ever .
this was a wonderful pre-quel to the star wars trilogy !
star wars the phantom menace is by far one of best movies ever . critics attacks on this movie , were just nieve ideas people who couldn't open their minds to greatness
a great movie . the special effects were outstanding
my favorite movie of all time...great for any age . a classic ! first crush as little girl was david bowie jareth , the goblin king even today i still get giddy when watch
this movie is one of my favorite if not . the dialouge so inventive and shows realization an adolescent that growing up isn't bad performances were amazing jennifer connelly was david bowie mesmerizing there still much to be said about his choice costume
this is & always will be one of my most favorite movies ever . the costumes are great , music fabulous special effects were state art in 80s david bowie looks really hawt it's funny ! normally i dislike george lucas stuff henson's creepy muppets but they actually made movie better
labyrinth is one of the best fantasy movies ever made . it completely entertaining from beginning to end i absolutely loved  ! would recommend this movie over and again
this movie is great! ! it has great songs , dialogue and muppets . its one of the most underrated childrens movies out there
david bowie is hot as the goblin king , jarreth . i was a little girl when movie came out and now my loves it much do jennifer connley great big sister who wishes her brother away then goes on journey to save him from becoming love music overall look of beautiful
it's worth seeing just for that magnificent car-chase , probably the best one ever filmed . there are plenty in other movies crazy and violent but this is like a real chase as realistic though you were it yourself also notable about fc psychological depth--you really see investigator coming unglued with his own obsession much richer than most hollywood fare
the best movie of all time .
david bowie is one hell of a sexy man . i love the labyrinth
so sad , and thus funny
incredible!! ! what do we now that jim henson is no longer with us ? who's going to give such imagination in a movie this timeless . i was watching it the other day and my teenage nieces tried make fun of saying for kids.before new they were hooked next when woke up again sure technology has brought far all computer animation , but how miss puppets only wish could have done at least three more movies like
one of jennifer connelly's first films and se is fantastic . jim hensons muppets are david bowie as per usual , even if he singing awful 80's songs ! i agree with bascillam you like this you'll dark crystal (why don't they show on tv anymore??) it very good for kids because shows have to take responsibility their actions overall a fun film that appeals all ages
this movie is awesome . i have seen a thousand times , but it never stops entertaining me it's just the whole idea of magic and castles done in such fasinating way also love bowie he so great oh my god girls check out his pants !
i adore this movie . bowie became my hero after saw his performance in great have seen probably over 100 times and still love watching it
i've been watching this movie since i was a kid . am 22 now and it's still one of my favorites all time the soundtrack costumes main characters are really 80's , but everything from sets props to dialogue is so well executed that me it remains timeless as alice-in-wonderland-type theme where daydreaming young girl reluctant leave her fantasies behind grow up (a problem can certainly relate to) learns accept appreciate life people in for way they
i loved this movie from the first time saw it at teh age of nine , took me away to fantastic world where reality had no bearing and david bowie wore tights!! ! grins although didn't notice how great they looked on him till a few years later . all in it's an awesome
one of the greatest crime movies all time , overall french connection is essential to today's films . landmark chase-scene gene hackman's great performace this film certainly better best picture winners at oscars if you haven't seen it you're missing out go down your local video store and get summary : sheer genius a must-see
that was good , and funny
excellent puppetry ! i love a good jim henson movie , and this is one of the better ones (i'd also like to recommend dark crystal if you labyrinth too) . an loss innocence/coming age story (the heroine learns that she has be more mature take responsibility for things as battles tempted by goblin king in attempt save her baby brother)
definitely one of the best childrens movies ever made . a strong female character that uses logic , wits and courage to overcome adversity make true friends
a beautifully composed jim henson film with all the easy to love characters and good morals that have graced his other films . this movie is especially terrific because its plot brings young girl through 'hero's journey' inot maturity witty insightful looks into actual process of development
if you haven't checked out david bowie in tight pants , then seen the best of jim henson and his team magicians finest hour power . keep it movin' dave !
one of the best car chase scenes in film history
a strange movie which will definitely baffle anyone seeing the as an adult for first time . if you can handle idea of david bowie magical , musical villain like this very much
you remind me of the babe . what ? with power voodoo who do ! babe..
labyrinth was jim henson at his best in the movie industry . puppets were works of art
an instant classic-too bad the sequils sucked !
classic .
a well done movie that didn't need sequel . clancy brown deserved an oscar for his work as the bad guy scene in church is too funny nuns....no sense of humor
one of the all-time greats . revolutionary documentary-style work by once-great william friedken yes , gene hackman's popeye doyle is a brilliant creation but star movie really
as you might be able to tell by now , i'm a bit of sci-fi fan . yet again this is another film that i grew up with and still love has very good sense humour sharp it starts off in present day (mid 1980's) then goes through the centuries main character conner mccleod originally from scottish highlands banished due being labelled league lucifer he did not die battle when should have done eventually sean connery's comes into play tells immortal teaches him skills needs know for gathering fantastic lines such 'you overdressed haggis' all immortlas must fight eachother (using swords course) only way they can killed having their head chopped victor gets its opponents power strength one will survive 'prize' every thought everyone on planet what happening worldwide ( like god really) soundtrack fab - but queen so thread too sickening 'who wants live forever' sets really well
i've seen this movie over a hundred times . it was bit of ritual for me and my friends back in high school is one the best fantasy movies all time beware sequels , though ; there can be only
it's a kind of ma-gic ! absolutely fab . highlander was one the only real quality fantasies i've ever seen with fantastic soundtrack written by queen (aka magic ) and well-thought plot , i enjoyed film from beginning to end recommend it everyone no not just because although songs year love hammer fall are two my favorites story an immortal scotsman complete few cool special effects gets five-star automatic take care
this movie is one of few that ive watched 4 times in 3 days . but thats not just because you have to watch more than once understand it its so intrigueing and creative blew me away donnie darko the first ever seen combines sci-fi , horror comedy suspense mystery
this is a very interesting movie . it may seem bit weird , but the character and plot development superb touches on some concepts that many people don't think about i'm usually critical with movies i really liked one
gr8 film . confusing apparently they released a book to explain it must find i got on dvd , and have watched couple of times but don't get recommend watchin though - its gud
my favorite movie . it won , i think four oscars was made on virtually no money and should therefore be an inspiration to the aspiring filmmaker of today this film has for best car chase ever shot beating out steve mcqueen's masterful performance in bullitt sheerly by force hackman's incomparable acting speaking which hackman makes popeye doyle our hero a psychological house cards split second closing seconds not snapping but merely continuing do what he's done likable warmly real presence seem inconspicuously happy until then pit bull fighting aircraft carrier doesn't win you with charm action almost grostesque humanity has.. is simply indefinably winner
a wonderful movie , exchanges between the darko family are well orchestrated and funny . plot was very thought provoking characters developed for those who say it lacks in entertainment requires more than seventh grade education white picket fence with beautifully manicured lawn to appreciate
this is easily the best movie i may have ever seen. . it amazing
great . dark and disturbing
chut up ! i'm am generally a classic/indie movie snob , but i think that just about anyone would love this . patrick swayze best role ever and can't stand him or drew in most movies
go back to china , bitch !
a truly bizzare film about disturbed youth . dark story with some funny moments and tragic sacrifice to save teen's loved ones i also found the ending be very touching
this is a great movie . its up there with fight club deffinatly must see !
listen people , you have to see this movie . not only is it the most creative that i seen in years really affected me as a person well sad but beautiful way will make question what would be willing sacrifice for someone love if sci-fi horror stories and just good movies general highly recommend donnie darko promise disappoint
this comment is for everyone who complains and says that the movie was stupid . look if you thought then are ones only way can be considered don't understand it basically about a boy would rather die than alone in end he knows going to , live rest of his life without one loves gone pay attention makes perfect sense tell truth changed my lot different ways doesn't change your didn't shouldn't even try
this movie may be doomed to obscurity , and that's a terrible shame . produced by co-starring drew barrymore it is story of teenager the title character whose melancholia punctuated with dark music his era 80s has all intrigue an early david lynch film without ever caving make use lynch's trademark nauseating surrealism instead chills you its excellent way told donnie lured from house one night new imaginary friend frank 6 foot tall talking bunny rabbit metallic skull face it's good thing too because jet engine crashes that in donnie's room fallen plane nobody can find seems as shrink suspected he paranoid schizophrenic until coincidences cannot ignored start pointing him toward investigating existence time vortexes traveler future ? what does want if why dress actually turns into teen detective for while playing mood creates total control humor never failing frighten pointed suggestion living creatures are die alone i think last thought we see ponder lies bed laughing would still death meant people knew even loved could live keep their careers reputations met these i'm not giving anything away do urge
perfection . i lvoe the subtle scifi's and not cowboys in space movies this was great
while the chances of it happening are probably nill , it's a cool movie . there lots twists in plot and really makes you think about how one tiny little decision or act past could drastically change future definitely worth seeing
super sci-fi/fantasy movie . open your minds and enjoy the ride!! !
i first watched this movie a few years back because jim caviezel was in it . i'm an autograph collector , wrote to him and he sent personalized 8x10 not long after fell love with the film portrayed bittersweet relationship between father son made great cop dennis quaid very believable firefighter has interesting premise likeable characters
awesome
great movie ! if you have the dvd edition it should show how talking through time is theoretical . its interesting itself has a cast and fun heartwarming to watch
the movie spike lee wishes he made .
film is great . garth brooks' song makes the film!! !
what an awesome movie! ! the best i've seen in a while . dennis quaid shows real talent this movie
the plot was very heartwarming and showed just how strong a father/son bond can be
what a movie! !
this was a fantastic movie . even though the first 30 minutes were boring , picked up very well at end
this film started a highly emotionally charged , long running sexual affair . the theme of soundtrack alone is still enough to send shivers up any spine easily confused with rob roy for anyone who has no real knowledge scotland and definitely preferred by those like revel in their fantasies well scored battle scenes
it's been awile since i've seen this . when i saw the preview knew would like it sure enough , loved ! a very clever movie handling past and present times isn't amazing if you could change your future ?
frequency was a very hard movie to follow , but if followed the interesting and had great effects .
really enjoyed the movie . it sucks you in right from start and keeps on edge of your street
this is an excellent movie . the special effects are great and story , though not plausible intriguing very suspenseful
this is a great film !
the characters and relationships combined with perspectives provided to audience make this a masterpiece .
another great harry potter movie .
this movie is one of the best movies that i have seen . like better , because think i've first a little too many times acting did get
no matter what others might say...this film is good . the story excellent,(as many harry potter fans will tell you!) and directing has made magical side of it stand out in a fantasical quality for all there i do agree that great movie director done job bringing books to life so far think this was better than last one having read are few differences from orginal , but how can you expect such an imaginitive book be exactly same as written version ? following perviuos those rareties...a sequel actualy (and better) first one...i look forward next advise everyone try see film.it must sees past year now its on dvd even !
harry potter is not a nerd
the movie like books was surprisingly good .
even better than the first film and i loved that one ! pace is faster story a little darker . all exposition from largely out of way , so they can really concentrate on telling an exciting there are some funny moments to film...personally think rupert grint who plays ron brilliant in scene where he harry follow trail spiders through forbidden forest kept whimpering tugging harry's arm his voice cracking at humourous kenneth brannagh was also very as professor lockheart self obsessed icompetent new teacher hogwarts effects were well developed...quiddich looked more cgi character dooby joy watch
best . movie ever this ran circles around the first before i saw it , my favorite was nightmare christmas haven't read any of books though part with snake and bird
i liked this movie . when went in , thought was going to see a boring dull kids found out that is good for people of all ages go it
i have to admit that when saw the first harry potter was not impressed . had no intentions of seeing second release , but dragged see it with a friend my surprise this time around film quite good found comedy in character dobi am dissappointed learn he won't be any new movies
i loved this one . it is my all time favorite movie the whole plot was kick ass ! mummy's cg effects were very tyght he looked like a real pharoh later once regenerated imhotep villian and in evil cool second came off as tad on wimpy side story so characters are likeable even villians egyptian great gets think that imhotep's relationship with anck-su-namun should have been kept instead of her leaving him to die check out some won't disappoint
i loved this movie as a child , and still love it today . find to be perfect scary for kids has enough moments keep them gasping without there being anything really give nightmares the skeksies (sp?) were very creepy but gelflings neat make up story was great too is must see if you have children one of henson's best !
awesome movie great stories , music and nice animation . pity they never made a follow up it was well done the very revealing
excellent soundtrack realy good movie if hollywood ever does a remake first the would suck it be all yo and probaly pg 13 so don't ruin classic leave this one alone its fine just way is
this gets a 5 just for the animation,some of best ever.. . and hand done , with all variations within that computer animation can't seem to capture story is bit cheesy ment link animated stories together but it's still one my favorites
a true classic even if the animation looks little crude now . in days before i was exposed to anime , scene on bomber most terrifying piece of had seen plus it kick ass soundtrack that really captured essence music at time annoyed me second movie (f.a.k.k 2 bullshit) so poor part strength first comprised vignettes popular and successful stories run magazine casual reader mag seemed pretty clear this planned as from start lacked compactness
finally snagged the dvd in order to get a copy that wasn't so severely truncated . this is flick started it all for me ; hokey and sexist places , but effects ! krell interior shots carry away each every time breathtaking youngsters fantastic blast-from-the-past those who remember
the tempest in space . good fun
the rosetta stone of sci fi features and tv . birthplace captain kirk's character , transporter effect robbie robot quintessential soundtrack etc fabulous sets production design effects (killer pre-cgi but as yet unsurpassed) a great script based loosely on shakespeare's tempest buy don't rent you'll wanta see this one more than once
one of the finest sci-fi films 1950s . it is an adaptation shakespeare's tempest--look for ariel in robot , and if you can't find caliban aren't watching very carefully (i'll give a hint from shakespeare--prospero's comment on this thing darkness i acknowledge mine ) it's brilliant movie wouldn't mind seeing again right now.. oh don't forget to notice first all-electronic film scores eerie marvelously effective
great classic with effects far in advance of their day . still find it very watchable and moody forget the plot - this was matrix 50s man or machine who's ghost ? what does mean like you will many threads to follow draw your own conclusions
an outstanding movie - the effects really are superb . you see where roddenberry got his ideas from this is a must-see classic , w/ good double entendres comedy art direction and solid acting even synth score interesting
what a great , fun ride this was . nonstop action comedy and effects mixed with scary but story line
a lot of people really hate this movie . i personally love it think astrophysics is cool was released in 1997 when everyone crazy about aliens the motif isn't as popular now , so may not be appealing but it's still great jodie foster does an excellent job film explores galactic communication through matehmatical signals possible space travel and conflict between science religion entertaining very well-made causes viewer to reflect on what he or she believes some things are open interpretation i'd say must-see
one of my favorites . inspirational , really makes you stop and think about your place in our vast universe jodie foster delivers yet another great performance
there's just something about this movie that is awesome . maybe because its not a shoot up all the aliens becuase it makes you think long after ends i believe in et life , and really only appeals to me great way has jodie foster good
fantastic film . one of the very best 1990's , direction is excellent from always reliable zemeckis foster her usual superb self in first stab at science fiction great supporting cast top music and sound
written first by carl sagan as a best selling novel , this movie is full of interesting theories about the possibility alien contact and explores idea how it could happen . intellecutally visually stimulating that's why i love
excellent movie ! i didn't know anything about it before seeing . assumed was space travel/other life forms etc..i thrilled with this spiritual look at what is out there
this movie is easily one of the most incredible movies all-time . perhaps best all star trek , first contact brings back feared enemy introduced in q who ? and both worlds borg ! instantly a new enterprise revealed soverign-class an design battle scene towards beginning (which introduces akira norway steamrunner class vessels!) absoultely amazing as well plot classic trek--the evil have traveled time to assimilate humanity before founding federation our heroes must stop them action taut throughout balanced with clever bits comedy even moment that comes close breaking fourth wall (so your astronauts on...on some kind trek?) roddenberry humanism present references conquering poverty war strife addition evolving beyond money not slowing down bit rushes great finish musical score (including : tng theme) consistently enjoyable
first contact is the best star trek movie . hands down great acting , interesting storyline and special effects so far this has everything you laugh (a drunken troy) cry (data finding his cat sad) action i will never get tired of watching
i really enjoyed braveheart . think it was very wel written and directed also the fact that story true actually filmed in scotland although fight scenes were bloody graphic , a necessary aspect portraying truth behind
not quite as good 2,3 , and 4 but certainly better than the rest of trek movies . this is last passing torch trilogy (6,7,8) first all-tng feature it has everything : adventure suspence comedy drama ; an absolutely fun movie all way through (epcharles your review's misplaced --heh)
it's an even numbered trek movie , so it must be good . that's out of the way borg are excellent frightening villain though queen might have been more impressive first contact with vulcans on earth was a top ten moment zephrom cochran sure looks different than he did in original series but who's paying attention you got to admit that moments where picard gets accused having ahab thing for and when calls worf coward were exceptionally cool well scripted same as responds by telling him if any other man i would kill stand  eventual apology which tells he's bravest ever known data also makes battle deflector dish extremely interesting : love how uses borg's arm seal leak his space suit great effects too
i have no doubts this is the best star trek movie yet
arguably the best star trek movie in series , first contract embodies whole essence of show . determination exploration survival against devastating odds- this has it all definitely a must see
this was the best star trek movie of all time . it had a good storyline about borg and acting terrific there lot action exciting sequences not only to fans but also average goer
this is my all-time favourite movie , along with the mummy returns . great special effects and lots of laughs coming out one i havent seen a better best thing there no gory bits pieces for me to puke on.i hope becomes classic you cant get thriller than love may have been caused by an equal interest in egypt whole family !
edward scissorhands.....haha . awesome !
this movie was interesting yet had a touching story line to it . what strange idea , have scissors for hands
the pick of litter star trek brood . crew goes back through time to get some hump whales so that an alien probe had communicated with centuries ago will stop destroying earth it has humor as well a good story line
out of the star trek original series movies (with capt kirk) , all six this would have to be best . it was so interesting seeing them mix into 20th century realistic and had a very yet mysterious story line
2nd behind wrath . great fun for a sunday afternoon matinee spok dives into pool and talks to whale...priceless
the fourth star trek movie is very funny ! although plot has planet earth in jeopardy , our heroes time traveling back to crazy late 20th century makes for some great humor . and of course ending awesome
both the mummy and returns are fun films to watch .
the last entry in genesis-spock trilogy -- this movie begins and ends with conclusion to events of treks 2 3 . but main story concerns a cockamamie cetacean probe that disrupts earth core is comedic time-travel adventure fun all around for trekkers non-trekkers alike (oh , lister you might need change your review ;)p )
the sixth and final installment of star trek series with james t . kirk wraps up very nicely this movie has it all ; action , drama comedy but fans will love since leads into new besides dynamic storyline special effects were extraordinary is played out perfectly these if you like even non-trekies enjoy displays
this is the first of modern sci-fi films , but it really isn't about outer space - rather it's an allegory using space-man motif to make a universal plea for disarmament -- not popular message in cold war atmosphere 1950s . view power mccarthyism and hollywood black-listing at that time amazing film was released
if you're looking for matrix-type special effects , this movie isn't you . it's a film that uses scifi format plot has nothing to do with interplanetary travel - except as the catalyst message of also interesting see how filmmakers in 1950 envision spaceship (interior and exterior)
the 2003 videohound guide to films available on vhs and dvd says following : a gentle alien lands earth deliver message of peace warning against experimenting with nuclear power . he finds his views echoed by majority population , but not ones who are in control this account based loosely story christ michael rennie is visitor backed mighty robot gort one greatest science fiction all time
unlike modern sci-fi films , the day earth stood still is not about dazzling special effects . it tells a story which at its base biblical -- and flying saucer aspect almost incidental was generation ahead of time warmly received by cold-warriors 1950s hollywood had to tone down peace-on-earth message but it's there michael rennie british actor who hitherto been seen in america ideally cast lead precisely because he brought no star baggage with him role that combined intergalactic celestial
the protagonist is a christ-like figure of incalculable power who comes to earth alert us dangers war  .
not big on razzle-dazzle special effects , but makes a very strong statement regarding world peace and the futility of relying military power in dealing with unknown .
one of the greatest sci-fi films all time . based loosely on life christ
a sci-fi movie with message - when flicks weren't supposed to have messages  .
patricia neal was never better.. .
released over a half-century ago (1951) , this film was prophetically realistic .
this runs like a really good episode of the series . ironically , in retrospect gradual descent quality can be traced back to around time although movie is one best x-files stories 5th season/6th season era it rather rips-off lot other great sf but doesn't dwell on too much and goes right into xf story without slipping giving mark snow full-fledged orchestra was not necessarily idea so score as his scores for tv show ultimately appreciated after seeing major mytharc episodes seasons 1-5
wow this movie was just great . if you like the tv show then will it has dramma and action advntur roamnce all good stuff a should have i on video watch so much am still waiting for sequel need to remeber truth is out there really
cool
freaky things happen all the time people ! this shows us what can . if something weird happens to you know this.....the truth is out there
the x-files movie fit in perfectly between seasons of series . it allowed a deeper understanding conspiracy involving mulder and scully underlying plot coupled with humor makes this hit
just as good the show (ok , maybe better) i can't wait for more! !
establishes a genre . true cult classic mel gibson started the futuristic nihilistic world series of movies
when i was a teenager our family first got cable tv in the early 80s and they would play this movie on hbo all time . scene where max's wife child are killed gave me nightmares is an excellent story of grief-stricken man getting revenge sequels were weaker sunk deeper into far fetched science fiction special effects
get the undubbed version with added scenes - alot more going for it.. . i watch it just car
wow . loved this movie
the greatest movie of 2004 !
good movie . great special effects just don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy alot !! !
great movie !
a good movie to watch and its one of thoes movies you have over understand .
this film was better than i ever expected . like kaufmann's eccentric , creative and somewhat quirky style that he uses to tell stories did in being john malkovich doesn't go down the road of writing conventional formulaic movie scripts some makers nowadays breaks rules routine consisting a beginning middle end his characters always have soul you as audience care about them eternal sunshine.. story do with love but didn't route making it too sickly more entertaining very interesting kaufmann is one those rare writers where can watch movies over again capture something new may previously been overlooked jim carrey so much serious roles comedy third i've seen involed liked kate winslet continues progress profession shes almost mastered supporting cast (jim broadbent kirstin dunst elijah wood) were just good
except the ending pretty amazing go watch & you'll be rewarded
you have to expect that any film written by charlie kaufman is going be a little unusual - and eternal sunshine certainly . the plot crazy after his girlfriend breaks up with him , joel (jim carrey) learns she has undergone radical procedure erase all memories of from her brain so devastated breakup heartbroken 'erasure' ex he too decides go for as undergoing realizes subconsciously doesn't want this girl erased despite pain heartbreak desperately needs remember begins desperate game hide seek in carrey's subconscious carrey tries protect 'erasers.' bizarre sounds extremely well done stunning performances (who i've never liked) winslet touches on things like fate moving lost love way creative hilarious touching one better films seen while
i loved this movie ! i've never been a major fan of charlie kaufman or jim carrey , but was something special . although the plot may be far fetched human emotions were very real to life magic that kept me thinking about it for days afterwards wish more people would see with an open mind
easily one of the best movies ive seen in a long time , just second to amores perros . eternal sunshine is great love stories our told with pace inteligence and always avoiding corny spots (very non - hollywood) very few have been this keen smart at trying find essence relationships general between men women i used hate charlie kaufman dismiss him as an eccentric screenwriter urgent need valium or mental institution he reedems himself completely bravo ! matas pontdebulle
one of the better movies i've seen in a long time . great acting , story need to see it few more times really understand
genius screenplay , beautiful cinematography exquistite acting (particularly mr . carrey) phenomenal soundtrack everything comes together like a neatly wrapped packaged although it may seem at some points to go off in several different directions if you have an imagination wonder true love exists and enjoy seeing moments on screen that reminiscent of your favorite life will also say it's the best you've seen all year
the comedy version of indiana jones . one those movies you don't get tired
excellent acting and inventive screenplay provide for fine entertainment . carrey is oscar-worthy , as kate winslet
wonderfully done . jim carrey is amazing on this one
i've never seen the movie but i thought i'd follow classictvfan's fine example and rate a didn't bother watching . does anyone else see problem with this ?
i pitty any fool that doesn't like this movie . the acting was great everyone in show preformed their part wonderfully it is a
i really loved this movie .
james cameron has a great talent for entertainment in his movies . but personally , i think this is one of finest  simply because while it does have action and eye-candy they are rather understated no better than equal to the amazingly crafted characters every character very realistic with plenty flaws dry workplace humor an underlying thread goodness even let you know that bad guy wasn't really evil he just cracked underwater pressure
very unique storyline , and the special effects with aliens were spectacular . ideas set forth in movie creative
a wonderfully scripted and acted epic about the rise of scottish revolution . mel gibson gives audience very graphic depiction medieval life warfare while some aspects william wallace are embelished , lack true factual data allows bit creative lisence
if you do not know who ed harris is , this movie includes a great acting job by him . the abyss only sci-fi that brings in exciting fantasy but also futuristic film examines science experiments (some of which have yet to be attempted) has social commentary from both human and an extraterrestrial perspective
great as usual for james cameron . but , what's better what amplifies the story and gives a closer view of all cool characters is special edition dvd you get two version in one fabulous looking seal than other (theatrical version) sure movies released theaters had laughs forms entertainment was heart-wrenching at end (between actors ed harris mary mastrontonio).. i prefer seeing giant waves overwhelm coasts countries giving those aliens some sinister personality it's remarkable ending with even cooler effects themselves give 5 stars to
when i saw this movie , was so drawn in with the characters and overall thought of living deep at bottom sea that wanted to be a scuba diver .
from start to finish , the abyss exemplifies all that sci-fi should stand for creativity originality interesting story line and cool aliens . effects were kick ass i also approve of casting lighting directing two a half thumbs up
great film . slightly confusing until seeing the end of and watching it again
this movie was incredible . i saw it in the theater when first came out , and amazed not only at special effects but also acting strongly disagree with those that say had a weak storyline every actor actress mummy talented gifted played their parts well they brought comedy into jokes tension high sexy bander between brendan rachel kept perspective things were getting over top suppose you would have to genuine interest egypt ancient cultures appreciate film worth $7.00 see $15.00 buy on vhs
this is a fun flick to watch bruce great and the effects are not bad at all . has be cult classic it sounds in surround sound casting wonderful story an oldie but goodie fight scenes good there lot of humor through out movies which keeps moving must see dvd  !
this is my favorite movie . its pure fun perhaps the criticism true plot isnt revolutionary characters arent deep special effects are not best you have to look past all those stuck-up snubs and see real beauty in film pace really what grabs there little time spent on characterization , but whats done well movies overall frenetic can be seen as a method of glossing over lack main backgrounds revealed quickly allowing continue bruce's character korbin dallas easily established his opening scene he takes phone call : background military recent divorce current occupation cab driver soundtrack lends itself with high-energy mix techno classical middle-eastern sounds sound themselves huge compliment every word action so if want get technical i think set design awesome it makes future grungy bright at same sets often use large amount hot colors pop spots blue against them costumes also incredibly imaginative additionally utilizes lots montages cross-cuts hard explain unless know terminology basically editing genious jumps between they tell each others stories made me fall love humor proportion just plain funny especially bruces dry sarcastic mention one-liners like listen lady only speak two languages - english bad nearly cartoonish acting by many notably ian holm gary oldman hilarious personally find garys over-the-top southern accents adds monologues way interact believable that end when bruce tells breath youll do says anything dare laugh robber door
suprisingly funny movie !
i love this movie , my favorite sci-fi . bruce willis is very good and cool lovable
off the chain man that movie was so tight it is tighter than tights
quite an exciting movie with bruce willis as the main character on his quest of saving world . nice plot and carefully chosen actors score is excellent for listening purposes
futuristic , but still realistic . good actors that feed off each others energy the movie has a complex plot is easy to follow
i enjoyed this movie because of all the aspects life portrays . whole meaning fo fifth element is that not possible without forces love costumes were original , action and plot extraordinary directors view our world in future very critical lifestyle today
a great action packed movie . lot of drama and candy for the eyes was actually very predictable but i liked way bruce willis played major ass
one of my all time favorite movies . the story was nothing like anything else out there who ever picked music did a real good job soundtrack is great
i watch this movie all the time ! wish could be someone like 5th element . she rox
this movie is great . futristic that had a storyline and superb action one thing made complete was the excellent soundtrack
i love fifth element ! it was so cool , and totally unlike many sci-fi films nowadays . liked the blue diva
come on ! everyone knows that the is awesome if bruce willis hero .
this was a great film . fun , fast-paced and lots of twists like the tv show sequel lost it big-time though
the cast did a great job..it was pretty tought movie to do but they pulled it off..hats off them..really enjoyed this movie..i think is shyamalans best movie.the concept really good, . scary at times and had tinge of humour in it..absolutely loved it.. little girl movie..hehe\mel gibson phoenix other kid good job..shyamalan god sci-fi
this should definatly be higher on the list . is an awsome m night shaymalan movie i've watched many times and i still enjoy every minute of it proves you can have exciting without overusing cgi in a film to watch
very good movie . i wouldnt change a thing
awesome (adj) : anything that leaves you in awe and wonder . by definition , signs is an amazing movie leave the theater of what just saw see this movie!! !
monkeys !
signs was a very good movie . it had great directing , casting and wonderful effects through out the whole thing i at endge of my seat waiting wanting to see what happens next but also scared crap this is buy watch over
i enjoy the occasional fantasy film but admit that m not biggest sci-fi buff in universe . however , will go out on a limb and say this may possibly be most meaningful genre since day earth stood still  first thing noticed is unlike many of today s scifi/fantasy films you do start as though have suddenly been transported into video game steroids absent constant panic-stricken mode non-stop breakneck speed instead signs draws slowly proceeds to unfold at nice even pace features believable characters get know like going through their daily routine realistic location sense reality key element makes more fantastic part story work so well ; it provides right environment for seed possibility grow mind viewer very done with an excellent cast big plus one only gives time think something about
the best movie ever! !
very good movie ! scary , funny and dramatic
m . night shymalayan is so far-and-away the best moviemaker of our era , it's not even funny this an a+ movie just like sixth sense was (unbreakable perhaps a-) as usual his script fantastic and unpredictable he takes old hitchcock-style tricks suspense better than anyone from opening credits gets you off-balance with stress-inducing socore ominous signs keep on edge.. but then moments humor settle your nerves get involved characters before ratchets it up another notch whole thing superb a that's fun to think about at least three different angles watch same time how many films can say that ?
an interesting twist on a myth that has been around for very long time . requires some open mindedness like most scifi i guess if you don't get it never will spinned off into two good tv shows
heck , this is a pretty good one very entertaining and thought provoking .
this is a wonderful movie.i give it 5 stars because of the beautiful creaturera !
awesome
this film is f***in sick and savage man one of the best action movies century so far .
better than cinderella man broken flowers your ass this version does not suck you
this is a must-see movie!! ! the climax like whoa
very good . a well done movie , and suspensful acting an awesome story
i recommend this flick to everyone within earshot . carpenter had a way of establishing mood with his early efforts , and one sinks its teeth into your spine settles in just enough casting acumen keep you involved the characters without harboring attachments them when they bit dust (which knew was going happen) slightly sloppy special effects department but certain scenes hit packed wallop (the head-bug doorway continues chill) pacing exceptional ending is not be missed classic that's mentioned nearly
a classic movie . similiar to the original but i would not call this remake plot borrows from story with regard location and an alien discovery similiarities stop there move is powerful combination of frightening events some gore mixed in expert handling suspense drama entertaining engaging beginning end acting very admirable ending magnificent one carpenters best efforts must see
in my opinion , the greatest sci-fi remake.. . ending is superb
one of my favorite films . very creepy and gory
tom cruise's acting was excelent . the movie brilliant and engaging it keeps you on your feet whole time
pretty scary movie . kurt russell was very good in this one , almost too to be a horror
an excellent remake of the 1951 classic ! music and special effects are scary movie is supenseful gory .
carpenter isnt the best director , but story is genius (campbell's who goes there ? ) and he totally lucked out getting rob bottin mike ploog dean cundy morricone's score rest . it a masterpiece i believe good movie should affect you this scared living crap of me bravo !
very good .  they should make a sequel
excellent creepy scifi suspense film . mixing horror and tension superbly , blending with it great character actors a tough leading man - kurt russell top special effects make-up worthy
one of the few unbelievably good thrillers to come out john carpenter's long and periodically disapointing career . this is scariest chill bump inducing sci-fi movies i have ever had privalledge view on a remote government base stationed in middle no where antarctica strange things begin happen when dog chased onto their by russian scientist from another near who trying kill killed before he gets chance what follows best ideas put film alien being aboard ubsorbs living beings tries become them results are pure terror can mimic it's host perfectly so it always keeps you guessing as could be carpenter weaves far frightning tale his flair for visual scares gift creating empeckable atmosphere showcased here master story teller bad now days all sh*t scripts comes highly recommended ! any sci-fi,horror,great fan should give themselves great treat watch classic
this one is more interesting then the first .
a very great movie but for some reason i liked the first alot better . guess when saw spider-man wasn't expecting much then after it , loved ! in this was to still gets 5 stars though
blew me away . bravo
i absolutely love brian depalma's directing . also liked it because wasn't all about the action scene was backstabs and meticuously laid out plans that worked to a tee good spy movie like bond is , but there only one not be imitated writers of this obviously recognized now second couldn't tell if watching m:i2 or new
i think it was even better than the first one , but they were both great !
i just got back from seeing spider-man 2 and it was very good . the danger of waiting to see a movie like this is all hype nothing can stand up that said not as great led believe couple scenes seemed bit over top out place rain drops keep falling on my head , could have done with also m.j appearing during death march mean wedding more than little predictable lot action many special effects no acting oscars for but cast pulled off so wait begins spidey 3 do you in hob goblins ?
this one was so cool and in ways it better than the first .
loved spiderman 2 ! saw it in imax with my dad , and i . spidey is awesome he finally got his girl a good lesson to be learned happy ending
just as exciting and entertaining the first film . spider-man 2 definitely lived up to , in many ways surpassed it (especially mixing drama comedy) films do not seem be going downhill quality like so previous superhero sagas have let's hope that upcoming addition series keeps way
for good vs . evil,special effects and the cast,spiderman ii is tough to beat
after the disappointing first feature , spider-man 2 comes along and smashes all expectations of it by being almost as great can be . a sequel its like wrath khan to star trek's motion picture special effects in movie's creatively-inspired action sequences simply have seen believed there is also lots humor--running gags references both other marvel comics original tv series kirsten dunst absoultely beautiful mary jane watson actor playing j johna jameson has his character down perfect (and one funniest film) there's speech from aunt may about how world needs heroes good guys cliffhanger ending guarentees on whole much more optimistic upbeat than film short an incredible cinematic achievement
the best comic book movie ever . story and characters were way better than first film villan (doc ock) was cooler more better-looking compared to in i highly reccommend this wether you're a spider-man fan or not
with that ending you're pretty much promised a sequel . i mean harry's current situation and the introduction of dr.conners (the lizard) you can almost see next villian terrorizing town
a great installment in the superhero series . i would even say it was better than first movie fun and charming , had flow held attention spider-man did special effects good storyline tobey maguire has role of peter parker down to an art hope he continues play masked hero since this film left doors wide open for third definitely worth seeing
(warning : contains spoilers) very fun movie . this takes place about 2 years after the first left off peter's in college , and is having a rough time balancing his normal life with web-slinging job he realizes need to set priorties straight personally i think it might have been bit too soon for spider-man unmask himself some people but guess needed be done either way was worth watching
there were three main versions of this movie : the original 1956 classic ; equally great and extra-creepy 1978 version disgusting bad '93 , simply called body snatchers . i highly recommend first two prime cut very effective thought-provoking sf '78 has some really creepy sound design too a wild who's who cast best ending
i would recommend this movie during halloween . , when it first arrived at the theaters frightened me because was considered to be future
one of my personal favorites once i could understand the plot . love movie because it was original and sexy tom cruise did a fabulous job at holding audience in suspense own soundtrack
this movie was probably the best fantasy film i've seen...too bad we get dumbed down version edited for american consumption.the other cut goes deeper metaphysically,but might have offended all those born again bubbas .
this is one of my most favorites ! i actually like more than lord the rings tom cruise sexy , it has a great plot that's surprisingly similar to tweeked goth version swan lake plus elves & dwarves are just hillarious^o^
i love this movie ! not only is it beautifully shot , the actors were great . tom cruse was at his sexiest and tim curry terrifying just bought 2 disc dvd very informitive on how enchanced me as a child still watch almost 15 years later
a movie that should have inspired the drdge in washington to actually make an island prison save us all from repeat offenders . alas , they could not get picture oh well was great anyway ! kurt russell proved he more than kid disney movies this donald pleasance (the professor halloween) as pres good i got real kick out of russell's character dark and comic at same time rent it own love
never turn this over whenever it comes on (should get disc) . even cut up , it's better than 96% of the sickly bilge cable spews forth so many great moments you'll lose track another in a long line kurt russell triumphs not as futuristic you'd suspect (the world trade center towers are still standing) but puts you frame mind to how things might come down worst-of-all-possible worlds egg my face dept. : film was set 1997 twin would be standing (i initially thought mid-2000s) just goes show that carpenter's more visionary i gave him credit for
more of an action film than sci-fi , but still fun to watch ! update : there is a dvd (both special edition and regular) out just thought that pbeavr would like know hope it helps
classic - the percival scenes are best.. .
like james bond , ethan is our kind of special agent . het gets to break into facilities using interesting tools and weapons he look at confidential papers the girl what was all bad though his folks get shot
awesome movie , a real classic ! one of my all time faves . this on dvd is pleasure to watch
a masterpiece by john boorman.the greatest cinematic version of the arthurian legends.as another posted noted too much story for so little time dramatic license had to be used some characters . this movie an allstar cast great and soon actors:nicol williamson as merlin is scenestealer in including patrick stewart,liam neeson,gabriel byrne,helen mirren,nigel terry nicholas clay.it somewhat strange that actors playing arthur lancelot two three leads did not achieve bigger stardom.the irish countryside effects are incredible must see fantasy,action fan
a universal myth told with breathtakingly great direction . some of the finest lines in any modern script superb acting powerful emotions between this and 'zardoz' , john boorman has earned his place among my favorite directors
this is the best film adaptation of king arthur , and cinematography superb . john boorman directed wonderful movie it brings audience in to mystical era story tragic has its moments folly there are great lessons be learned here envelopes us all seal letter let flow
excellent movie . don't miss it
my dream : i wish was a midieval knight . it very accurate to king arthur too also had great actors
this was a great , exciting and adventurous movie that really lets you get look at what the medieval times were like . story is fast moving holds audience in awe
a great movie .
i still watch it every now and then - feels a little like clockwork orange for some reason.. .
i thoroughly enjoyed this film . m not usually a big fan of movies with tom cruise in them , but one was certainly different surprised to find it being long as when watching the time flew by
a masterpiece . one of the greatest movies all time only downfall is that i heard guy who wrote story changed some things around from what really happened to william wallace in actual history but hey , doesn't make movie worst movie's still great !
i love tom cruise anyway and he just made this movie especially great . think that all the technology in is amazing
i thought this was great . a film which treats it's audience as if you're intelligent what change !
a truly remarkable sci-fi film . unfortunately this movie has been overlooked by people that would rather see pointless explosions the plot will keep you thinking well after ended if enjoy movies are dark and intelligent then be able to at least appreciate one
i'm rating this movie just because it was cool , and i want to attach my name somehow . everyone you've ever seen who wears black all the time will love forever is a forum for hideous fascist dehumanizing behaviors.. which stop in end ! yes did mention that ? good prevails okay then like 'strange days' based on false premise memories can be implanted human minds nonetheless its value as fantasy escapism unparalleled imagery directorial finesse also jennifer connely easy eyes
this si sci-fi at its best . you don't have to huge ugly aliens or white house's being blown up make a good flick well , for it be bankable need those things but that is beyond the point dark city brilliant director alex proyas created one of films ever made.a film explores fragility human mind identity mystery love and above all strength spirit heart through darkness who can bring about sun power within change very underrated sleeper bombed box office i had pleasure seeing while was still in theaters since evening held beautiful close my message has helped me become am today remarkable filmmaking highly recommended though not everyone will like believe any real movie fan with an open accepting fall wwith milestone science fiction
the storyline was very unique and creative . i love this movie good special effects , great
love this movie . shows that humans don't always have to be the ones conquered
this is probably one of the most unappreciated films 1990s . while movie does lack action , suspense there to draw viewer into a mysterious setting special effects still show how models can be used create visual works art in
dark city is one of the coolest gothic sci-fi's i've ever seen . plus , it's completely original aside from obvious similarity between aliens and vampires never anything like it before
this is a great movie ! it makes you think . the plot was unique and flowed nicely vivid , powerful dark i really like ending very creepy
this ionly goes to prove how good an actor chuckie heston really is . a poor script and the bad acting by others (not including edward g.!) , thin plot line yet he shines brilliantly like in lot of his flicks dies memorable believable death one too ijr says check it out !
scary thought that we could one day run out of food and eat each other to survive!! ! a 1973 sci-fi classic is must have in any collection .
i tend not to like movies that are be continued.. . because the second and third movie usually sucks but was impressed with matrix reloaded it made me look forward last one
the effects are great and story is a little vague but compelling . not as good first one most of suprises gone , you've seen it in typical 2nd part trilogy leaves you with more questions then answers
excellent movie !
fantastic
another outstanding movie! ! didn't match up fully to the first , but still was a great movie
great action and soundtrack . well acted , despite keanu reeves' presence surpised monica belluci's role didn't require her to runn around half naked in it gloria foster (the oracle) will be missed
i seen this movie afternoon . and itr was worth every penny
this movie was fricken awesome . the graphics were good and so plot many people thought that it a bad , because they too dumb to understand maybe should go back middle school get some common knowledge
all of you are complete morons for thinking that it wasn't the best movie have ever seen in your life . need to get a reality check and see how actually good was stop trying bring down such awesome , so accept under-educated freaks
the clowns saying negative things about this film are probably too confused to understand it- it was a great and exciting
i ff thru it just to watch brad and bruce's dialogue in the insane asylum . think its best has done
one of the best ever .
another complex gilliam masterpiece . most folks want escapism that doesn't bewilder , which is why a lot of his work keeps people at arm's length 12 monkeys one you have to watch least three times in order pick up the detail (most do it once roll their eyes and get line for matrix) chain-of-events thriller thinking person
a fantastic film directed by terry gillam . the plot is rather simple , but workings behind it make complex as comprises of time travel its quite dark movie isn't depressing i found moving main character james cole played bruce willis who sent back to past observe and pick up clues find out why most human race wiped rest have flee underground he ends in mental institute where meets with brad pitts (brilliantly performed shows that man intelligent) gets psychiastrist (madeleine stowe) helpl him this how humans assume don't open their minds other concepts on level love story music good well definately worth watching
great ending .
vin diesel is soooo sexy ! i saw this movie 3 times and wanna see it again it's so cool
the concept behind this movie is great . it also gives you creeps as plays so well on your fears of something lurky just at edge darkness creepy feelings galore
one of the best battle scence with ships . first time star trek use collison course and actually have ship collide
nemesis epitomizes how a trek movie should be ! starting off with the classic star next generation theme against background of moving stars , you know are in for great motion picture special effects awesome and even beat ones found first contact insurrection . cast actors could show tom cruise vin diesel other overrated dramatic good lesson to act plot is has lot mind games just as there some touches continuity : from previous events characters deep space nine voyager (!!!!) old friends dropping by alien races past adventures more action sequences so much better than james bond xxx mission impossible others that its not funny rivaling wrath khan best ever i gladly give five out stars!
if you're easily confused , don't catch flick . not it's got a great storyline !
a must see . the best action packed star trek nemesis , will be on dvd may 20 2003 i hope paramount pictures make play station game
the mummy is a film . plenty of decent action scenes and comedic relief at appropriate points solid performances by all parties involved generally thrilling entertaining , fully maintaining attention viewer from beginning to end
wow , what a ride !
i loved this movie ! the mummy and sequel of it were tottally thrilling . plus , i've always had a big interest in egypt coffins
i love all the characters in this movie . they are excellent actors and actresses definitely , is a five-star
well , i saw all of it except the last 15 minutes because they called us out a tornado was heading our way . needless to say what very good graphics are incredible
this is a really good movie . i like egypt lot and know about it for the most part egyptian things in are accurate just as first one , if not better of those movies that you have to see understand so don't say won't because didn't think thing they added very well was parts wars with huge numbers represented i'd go people love me it's 5 action 4 still probably 3 worth seeing
this movie had it all . action and special effects were through the roof made everyone in theather laugh.( comedian boy unlce little mummuies) im serious though you should really see
wow , i didn't think this movie would be on the list . my obscure but cool had to watch that three times (thank god for cable tv) at age eleven before understood what hell was going john lithgow outstanding especially way he say bigbooty with crazy accent
alot of fun to watch .
a great german director , high-class actor jeff goldblum  an d the award winner volker engel for special effects ! well story is typical mars attacks style . but 154 minutes this film will entertain you mark my words
the f/x in this movie are great and plot is interesting if not original . cast perfect , i am a huge fan of jeff goldblum but he did good job as will smith you have seen what planet been on ?
will smith was excellent in this film , i personally think it more of a comedy than science fiction movie .
the credit showed early to be given when it is due . mr smith did again this movie blew up charts and rightly so presence of one vivica fox certainly didn't hurt but role such major proportion being played by an african american was also a big deal all accounts gets two thumbs
independence day is the end-all of sci-fi movies . representation aliens disputes on old big-eyed , grey-skinned theory plot somewhat predictable but twists occur when they are least expected all in a must-see for true fan
will smith was perfect for the role . i liked story , it seemed like could happen aliens were very creative best movie of that summer to come out
while this movie falls into the category of scifi , it uses other elements to tell it's story . each character is developed through dialogue and action there not a feeling anything unnecessary occuring everything has place reason
this movie was beyond great . it sad , action-filled and funnny little stories ran through a big one showed uniting together of other countries in truly independence day
very good effects and storyline . perfect actors for the roles a little long
excellent plotting , terrific ideas and unforgettable .
i can watch it over and again w/the same sense of satisfaction .
consolidates a genre--gets 5 . mel gibson is in post-apocalyptic australia where gangs and loners prowl around trying to survive at the subsistence level
i thought the movie was hella good . skeptical at first , but then intrigued by all battle scenes and fact that mel gibson just wreaks revenge on everyone
awesome movie with great suspense . jodie foster did a acting job too
why the low rating ? it should be higher on list !
the peace with klingons seen in star trek : next generation is explained this feature film , last adventure all of original crew . plot interesting special effects (especially ones spacedock and space battles) are great characters course play well off each other highly recommended !
extremely suspenseful and excellent actors . very stressful !
gilliam's best film . thank god for cable tv in the late '80's , failing it i would not have been able to see this movie like six times which needed finally get my head around
one of my all-time favorites , and like comedian said not for everyone . i've seen this movie placed in every category from drama to comedy cult sf even within the experts are hard-pressed classify it any further is darkest dark comedies makes very many insightful comments on modern society along way proliferation media piles paperwork especially lambasted here setting a fascinating kind mixture decade 20th century all thoroughly scrambled into tale reminiscent 1984 other classic dystopias dream sequences as vivid anything alice wonderland there sorts little touches throughout that viewers can catch second third etc time around probably best experience brazil criterion's 3-dvd set which includes tons extras two different versions ! much more complete 142-minute edition fans with ambiguous ending shorter love conquers version happier
it's been said before , but either you love it or hate . most people will i (i'm different lucky me!) just see and make up your own mind if need another opinion to decide on whether a movie is good not try this one : didn't get all the face-stretching stuff weird costumes message was like heavy orwell made light there such thing gilliam's struggle story in itself maybe more sense under reagan still triumph of art over fascism (albeit pyrean one) therefore relevant also pretty entertaining comedy though as tries be warned
an instant classic !
i give it two thumbs up . jodie foster was great as always
this would have to be my favourate star trek tng movies . the music , especially when picard was entering into nexus beautiful and i love go where all desires were fulfilled ! that movie reminded me of heaven (the nexus) a bit plus story line good meeting between kirk interesting at least could defeat soren which
no matter how over the top stewart's acting may be , he is still light years ahead of william shatner's . then again my grandmother a better actor that shatner and she's been dead for 15 !
to me , this is the very best of all star trek films . you have kirk and picard fighting side by via nexus an energy band that can make your dreams a reality unfortunately villain played malcolm mcdowell willing blow up entire starsystems in order get back another plotline includes data getting chip installed gives him human feelings he has some funny moments film
although slightly inferior to treks 2 , 4 5 6 8 and 9 this one is still good . it brings the tos tng crews together shows us missing link in enterprises (the b excelsior-class) origin of guinan also foes lursa b'etor are brought back as enemies with emotions from data saucer seperation time travel theme other starfleet ships cool new sets has many great touches all trek movies comes highly recommended
check out tht champagne bottle in the opening credits . not only a cool metphor , but some of single best special effects that i have ever seen kirk goes like hero as always knew he would and enjoyed brief friendship had with picard standing over his grave was little painful : at risk sounding biggest dork world it put me close to tears when optimus prime died transformers movie losing big brother sniffle malcolm mcdowell is great really villain 300 year old dude whose planet wiped by borg (nice touch) he's trying return timeless (edenic) space ribbon unfortunately killing hundreds thousands people process worst points whoopi goldberg (boring drag) data relentlessly compromised i'd see more stuff first contact which tin man story can be done taste intelligence
famous cast , sci-fi combines a drama and real class acting from both trek legends !
very strange movie and a little bit complicated to understand . but that's what makes it extremly interesting touching somehow
before i saw this movie , did not care for ashton kutcher . thought he was silly and boring but when watched amazed me ! has such good acting range his character made smile cry is a truly well constructed film with an original tale no other time travel can top the butterfly effect even future sci-fi films aspire to these standards
this movie was veary good for a guy how plays dumb ass on t.v . he played role very well
i really liked this movie . it had a good plot , and amde you think.. was kinda sad though would have to admitt that up hated ashton kutcher but he proved in can portray serous character
i loved the butterfly effect . it's very suspenseful and it was impossible to tell what would happen next , also has a good plot (it's complicated won't begin telling you here) beware movie is extremely disturbing among sadistic moments in this are child pornography dog being burnt alive plenty of fighting using blunt heavy objects hit or miss will either love loathe
this movie proved to be an excellent and unique film . it will keep you at the edge of seat whole time always wondering what if that very disturbing , but also realistic due fact there are people really screwed up from things great
chilling and totally mesmering film offers top-notch performers , the best cinemotography in years . kudos to jodie foster for most melodramatic but likable performance of year
this movie was way better then i expected , totally unique storyline compared to most of today's movies which are so predictable and typical!! !
this movie may not have been that scary  , but it rocked! ! all the true fans should give a 5
very scary and fun movie .
this movie rocked!! !
resident evil was one of the best scary movies in a while due to fact that it didnt try and scare u by grossing you out with whole bunch blood guts , but playing your mental fears . thats why gets five star rating
i didnt think this movies would be as good it turned out , its really sweet
this movie rocksssss
simply put , an amazing movie probably one of the best sci-fi film hell last decade . it gives a shocking and very plausible look at not too distant future where people can genetically engineer their own children vincent played by capable ethan hawke is those who are engineered he was born out love without tinkering scientists genetic manipulation trying to quickly summarize in sentence or two (simply because you can't since movie's that powerful)...but basically rest about his pursuit dream becoming astronaut space corporation gattaca while bit slow places emotional incredible ride shows us meaning what be human we all achieve aspire music composed michael nyman musical scores stand on its though definitely enhances already great writing strong performances uma thurman among others this movies have had profound impact me if haven't seen should go rent immediately even as well ! will disappointed
after talking over this movie with friends , i find that you'll either kinda strange or it certain unexplicable-type feeling only you understand . the a wonderful conception of world reality twisted enough to make difference but not significant leap in viewpoint best ever made watch alone
in my opinion , gattaca is the best movie made out of whole decade 90's . it has such an original script and andrew nichol now at top favorite directors list i base that on this alone there are very few movies can say perfect but one them anyone who hasn't seen should go rent immediately
fantastic ! i saw this film a long time ago (and now own it) and was taken aback . it seems to me that people seem miss out on one of the main issues though eventually we will be able genetically engineer our children , but there is thing you cannot change - what feel think aspire do ethan's character an 'invalid' created naturally meant destined clean up after 'valids' he believed could more did can take as strictly being scientific viewpoint future goes further like alice in rabbit hole watch again you'll see mean
this movie has you learn a lot , i watched it at home and remembered from my biology class that g t c were letters stand for dna nucleotides . is great
very good movie to see when i seen the first never thougt ther would be a second one .
great storyline and acting . mel gibson is a savage i loved the battle scenes it was also very sad emotional stroy that made me think lot
one of my favorite movies . maybe it's love for greek mythology that helps me like it more but i everything about can't think anyone besides brad pitt who could play achillies , orlando bloom did ok as paris peter o'toole is excellent priam brian cox was so good at playing the evil agamemond and eric bana fabulous hector he really knew how to spout those powerful lines do have a compalint in wish there some background on story overall solid flick
i really loved this movie , and think brad pitt did a great job with his role as achilles .
i agree that this movie finally put brad pitt into a category of actual acting . mean love his movies , but not because over the top abilities was well made and acted by all
brad pitt did a good job in this movie . people may think he's all looks , and while he does look his acting looked just as splendid film from what i knew about battle coming into the thought directors there were couple of sketchy things like orlando bloom's which made me hot girl front but otherwise that couldn't have distracted at because it was very well done
wir bleiben troy
i really liked this movie....i kept suggesting it to my husband watch and he saying no now is telling everyone !
i have to give this a five just because i'm in love with the story . but where did makers go wrong (other than hiring screenplay writer!) ? think it is audience people who see movies today are not type can handle gritty literary/historical saga such as one they want their heroes be clean-cut good guys , and goes against achilles' nature put non-ambiguous role he supposed hero you admire for his sheer worth warrior grief at patroclus' death same time hate him being so pig-headed killing hector honorable foil that audiences would prefer dazzled rather made could complex achilles which was too bad my other complaint paris by end of movie desperate get come-upance---but never came ! instead becomes legolas boromir only they're on opposing sides menelaus he's survive totally unexplicably forgive helen everything she's done explanation turning out---the once again able softening if what causes unusual conclusion helen's bit epic guy's heart
i would give the cinematography 10/10 , direction acting and script 8/10 . was amazed from level of lighting sets frame arrangement following images rather than story
interesting and fascinating with some excellent actors .
wow finally an ending where the good guy does not win . jeff bridges excellent job as being paranoid terror professor , while joan cusack and tim robbins deliver a very dark creepy performance they are almost normal family but quite....very film
this movie was one of my all time favorites . i only about 12 when first saw but the fantasy just thinking plot gives you a good feeling actually wish aliens were like that instead fighting they approach to befriend them and in return granted fountain youth goes show how much can accomplish you're an alien
i have no idea why , but really liked this movie . every time see a quaker oats commercial with wilfred brimley expect him to say if you eat the won't ever get old and die
love kevin spacey . great movie
a truly suspensful movie...the first scene is great
i loved this movie . not just because of jake gyllenhall thought that the story line was amazing and creative , suspense enough to keep me wanting more all time it wasn't over top
what a great movie...a chef-d'oeuvre
i like this movie a lot it was fun to watch .
oh man what a terrific movie . this had all the qualities of good although it could have hada better plot , rest makes up for
this movie was really good . and even more , the special effects were excellent especially scene with all tornadoes in los angeles cool but i'll admit it did scare me
i recognize this film as great due to the fact that it is not a typical hollywood format . has an explosive , disturbing beginning and ends in unexpected blast !
actually , i really loved this one . a crucial part of the genesis-spock trilogy (2 3 4) lots good drama and action horner's best scores
another great trek movie ! that makes 9 this one , like the previous 2 focuses on cast from awesome next generation . in crew has to fight bad guys trying gain immortality by relocating an entire population of people a planet mixing well-timed humor with references other shows special effects heart-warming character moments and blood-pumping battle sequences insurrection is success beginning end
one of my favorite endings ever ! great movie and definitely worth picking up to rent someday .
i never tire of this film . excellent cast , although a little over the top in some scenes good plot and uplifting ending which really liked oh if ya love cats you'll flick ! naming is big job for one characters you'd like to hear t.s elliot being recited motion pic gotta see
i think there's a lot of things we could say about this movie ; tim robbins and jeff bridges were unbelievable great  !
one of the first sci fi movies i have ever seen . it made me fan that am
this a great movie  ! i loved it !!! tim robbins and jeff bridges are very good actors story , music.. . bye
simply fabulous ! loved it haley joel osment shows once more the amazing actor that he is - and hopefully will keep getting better cast including teddy very well chosen . story magical steven spielberg at his best , doing what does telling stories
one of the best guy movies ever made . fight scenes are off hook movie gives you a sense being right in actual makes feel for them !
suprised this movie was not big hit . had never heard of it till i saw in store took chance on because like the actors glad did
this will be revered as a classic in 20 years . trust me
excellent film by two of cinema's greatest (although technically , one is dead) . spielberg adapted to the nightmarish future world stanley kubrick in such a way that it's almost chilling i really enjoyed a.i and cannot wait until it comes out on dvd
movie making at its best,showing that in the not so distant future we can make a mecca or robot truly love owner,and showing distants it will go to feel loved itself . remarkable acting should win oscars for both haley joel osment and jude law if you want see really gets close characters doesnt disappoint , then this
twisted ! but if you have read my other reviews.. . that's style.. not a real little kid movie.. teddy is hero he so sadistic
i enjoyed that movie because it was like watching good prevail over evil . would be if there really a police officer who an android could get the bad guys story line had touching elements to
i love this movie !!!! ! it's the best , mickael and oliver are so cuteeeee . if you could see think that have to byebye world
this movie is exactly what it wanted to be and should have been . violent , funny prophetic the commercials intercut with action are classics themselves recent reign of survivor temptation-type shows i cannot help thinking about dobermans attacking rope-climbers or i'll buy that for a dollar ! director verhoeven probably only one who could film john brunner's stand on zanzibar get away
wonderful film ! best use of special effects i've seen for its time...right up there w/jurassic park's sean connery did a job as the voice draco , jason isaacs magnificent role lord felton . ok i'm playing favorites i guess ;) but it deserves 5 nonetheless
dragonheart rulz ! there is nothin better than a good medival story of dragons and the valant boy who saves day
like ptitfleur said , arlington road is a marvellous movie and the actors are so great! ! tim robbins (ptitfleur's lover;)plays god jeff bridges too . favorite of my friend i understand why
jason did a wounderful valiant in thie movie . i feel that he play very well and his such handsome actor should have with name at the top , instead of bottom list is just great actor...love you
tremendous .
instantly shot to my top 3 of all time after first viewing in the theater . gets better every i watch it on dvd
best movie ever ! i especially liked the violence , dancers (jessica alba gives me tingly feelings) and hookers with guns . also black white splashes of color if or message grinds your gears tough its brilliant making
arlington road is the best movie i ever seen ! love it!!!!! tim robbins and jeff bridges are excellent  there suspens , action beautiful actors : them !!
the computer animation is just phenominal . characters look hauntingly real and story was not too bad either if you think that in this film then i suggest get your vision checked how much further can they go with
crazy , movie . i still hate cgi the story is very quiet and beautiful despite hellraising action scenes think i'm in love with main character was afraid to see it because don't want get sucked back into world of video games (this based on one) but glad rented donald sutherland's gentleness power intelligence were perfectly cast his role alec baldwin brings usual smarmy blend machismo whining tone relentlessly dark movie's filled hope nobility if this had been live would be considered one best sci fi films all time it's a landmark for medium strongly recommended
oh i love this movie ! um , not so much the ending . don't want to give anything away but some ppl might like overall rules i'm giving it full 5 stars for amazing graphics and forth-coming efforts congratulations squaresoft us another make less sci-fi more fantasy-like
this movie is awesome . when i watched , forgot they were animated felt as if real people the storyline didnt come close to any of storylines in series but it was great
i just saw final fantasy : the spirits within last night , and was very impressed . graphics were enough to put me in complete awe story isn't bad either my only complaint is that doesn't really relate video game series much there are some other nit-picky details as a nut but movie whole excellent better than lot of movies out today plus new cgi animation revolutionary any computer animated existance hooray for square starting wonderful trend
this was great...loved how she planned to disappaer
this movie had an interesting yet more complicated story line . the graphics were very good considering what year it was made
criminally underrated , this first installment of the star trek movie saga is scored gloriously and exploring v'ger's domain theme remains a permanent fixture for fans sci-fi music . film's dark unknown nature welcome departure from traditional contrived cheesy original series it follows whilst long dialouge-less scenes may seem boring to some they are in fact simply cementing establishment space enemy as mysterious which adds great deal dynamic tension actually uncovering what all means
yet another man who got what he deserved . i sound like a hater more torture would have been good though
extremly well made . many of my(stupid) friends hated it because put the subtitles to fast and was dramatic i loved plot fighting okay , alittle overdown but very intense think chinese with added time setting highly recommended
one of the best thrillers last 15 years .
excellent movie , tons of action ; a bit on the artsy side (okay very artsy) but extremely well done . takes place two thousand years ago in war-torn china where provinces vie for control over land particularly ruler qin tyrants make many friends as enemies and this is story four such enemies/friends what you would expect from trailers don't come close to really get it's complete surprise even though some fight scenes are little silly (a la crouching tiger) visually stunning almost all way through (note : stop here spoilers ahead if care then continue) i loved multilayered take single show its complexities hard describe how both simple complex (with regards storyline) simultaneously big symbolism with color it has feel fable know based anything historical/mythological (the website suggests loosely history at least go http://www.herothemovie.com/ more info.) anyway definately worth watching
nice little story line , cool guys going around getting themselves into trouble  they go back time and meet some nasty people it is funny entertaining . great movie
i enjoyed the movie , expected it to suck because of ben affleck being in but liked a lot . he did good job so garner
it surpassed my expectations . the cgi was well done as were fight scenes comic book movie genre has been ressurected with sucess of x-men so that explains sudden boom movies ben affleck gave a surprising performance in this and i don't think it's fair to judge whole based solely on one's grudge against
if i thought it was worth 5 stars would shoot myself in the face or better yet rectum be slower and more painful-- screw anyone whoe liked this terrible film you can call a film-- porno has plot acting- jesus h christ wake up hollywood
great movie i've ever watched .
i was shaky about giving this movie five stars , but deep down think it's worth it . fine storytelling okay the kingpin is a little too mu-hu-ha-ha-ha sometimes and carnage of fight scenes tends to detract from characters' identities.. if only you could have two half hours posturing line delivery like do in comics some extent elektra just girl with sais daredevil creep kinky costume hood bullseye deranged he's lot fun movie's got heart incredibly well shot timed out has great sense humor stays faithful comic as much can affleck (p-u) nailing murdock who more or less mannequin books when not flaying somebody's ass supporting characters are extremely done almost point overkill everybody seems be willing bring silly superhero story life all book vigilantes ever hit screen torn up beat drugged messed guy best most believable maybe cheerable definite must see
this movie is outstanding . it gave an accurate view of that time and mel gibson was unbelievable in the acting , directing producing
michael dougles played this role really well , as a badass guy with heart and romance he won't forget .
heath ledger is by far the sexiest guy in hollywood.....what a babe !
this is a great movie , and i don't normally lavish praise on romantic comedies . the reason for that they are usually not very funny one both turner douglas start out being able to stand each other but eventually warm up meanwhile along with danny devito hot trail of valuable gem it leads them many venues circumstances
heath ledger is sooo hot ! the movie was really good and whole theater got into it .
even with the recitation of competing , love story was excellent . a classic style and modern edge it had little everything opened my mind more towards other places
this movie has an interesting plot . i couldn't decide wheather was a comedy , drama action or adventure it all of the above truly one my favorite movies year
a great mix of music from the 70's and early 80's . i loved story line bad guy , no matter who it is always gets his in end this an excellent movie to take your son its
a fun summer blockbuster .
an instant classic !
this movie is one of my favorites . it deals with romance and adventure , two things that generally are hard to find in movies whole family loves
my expectations were not huge on this one but i was suprised . the story good and kept you interested will does a nice job as supporting cast effect are great put all of that together have movie family film be it some what violent , minimal nudity no harsh language
there's some basic maths here sexy totty + up the skirt shot = sure fire winner
jurassic park wa a tight movie about bringing back once extinct dinosaurs . it is highly unlikely that this could happen though
so much better than the first part .
who wouldn't like to copulate with a creature from outer space ?
a classic !
this a great movie , the score is wonder effects are and script terrific . bruce willis billy bob do good job story basically we all going to be killed by huge asteroid only way save earth blow it up will make you laugh cry
all those sexy men in outer space... .
this movie is perhaps my favorite sci-fi/space type . the acting was incredible , and i loved storyline as well special effects props go to bruce willis ben affleck a great film ! plot went together perfectly with comedy drama excitement suspense all rolled into one
the movie was really good fun watching and i can watch it as many times want to. . had all aspects for a movie..bruse willis acted well even liv tyler ben affleck were good.the whole cast did job in doing this movie..good story.it million better than deep impact..bruce rules
i am not really a fan of science fiction,m but trully believe this deserves higher rating . it lasted about 2 1/2 hours , didn't seem thatr long when saw the plot came together perfectly acting was intense and special effects were some best have ever seen bit unrealistic they don't call fiction for nothing 'rockhound' my personal favorite provided nice comic relief from drama
one of the best sci-fi movies so far . well directed and good visual effects something which has created a knowledge about space in my mind close to reality
the movie was good because it showed excitement from beginning . great computer usage and i loved story line liked parts when they used high technology in asteriod this gives new ideas to future development
this movie was great . it gave a realistic view of how the world could come to an end effects were also very good
bruce willis is cool and ben afleck hot . liv a great actress-how could it be bad movie with this crew-and dont forget billy bob thorton !
sharon stone clenches this movies at the femme fatale . i would have prefered to see someone else other than michael douglas lead character loved lelani sorrell as roxy and it was an intersting 'whodunnit' too
more of jason , with his great performance... .
this movie had all the aspects of a well done action/adventure science fiction : comedy , drama suspense and well-written well-acted story . audience is totally on edge their seats from beginning to end it was so much better than 'deep impact'
armageddon is a typical jerry bruckheimer film . this movie has action and great special effects best judgement day kind of
armageddon had various themes leading to one overall . i liked the movie because it was interesting cast great liv tyler is best !
this was the only astroid movie that came out worth watching . very intense
robin williams was great
this is not about artificial intelligence . it human relationships , what means to grow up and old lose the ones we love that's why its a tear-jerker
robin williams gave it his best shot to become accepted as a bonified human .. ! the longer movie played more involved became . great specail effects and thoroughly enjoyed except for ending...don't take this wrong williams...but your supposed keep us laughing our virtual butts off....got that ? but you somehow managed bring into realms of real tears so knock stuff off mr or.. no-more 'dura cell' batterys dude got
gory , violent and often crude but very dramatic powerful ! long the acting story make it worth every minute . one of greatest action movies all time
this is just a great movie ! i get little frustrated when people talk about how sexy it . but that's not the main thing that makes so good very intense and suspenceful admit rented because wanted to see sharon stone , soon forgot was her got into story well made
one of the best movies i ve ever seen ! cried twice , doesn t often cry when see a movie (ok was little yes but not in an age 17) also liked future design all thought some things unrealistic (like flying cars...what clothes arcitecture human realations.. . ojal las proximas generaciones tienen tan bueno gusto really fantastic playing from lot actors actrisses only robin williams :-)) (from person that usually hates sci-fi)
way underrated as a movie , maybe little too cerebral for comic book .
this movie had everything . sharon stone is good looking and played a very killer kept me guessing throughout the end was surprising
aaaaaarrrrrrggggghhhhh
i enjoyed it .
i love the opening scene in movie , because there is a girl with nice ass banging some guy . keeps you suspense
of all the movies based on comics that have been released , fantastic four is probably one truest to and cartoons than any others . already a great comic book series fantastically realized as theatrical feature plot centers around main foes ff dr doom after gaining their powers they must face him down he blames them for his own transformation continunity touches are include references doom's home country conflict between human torch thing more acting very good--especially actors portray jessica alba also quite good--and extremely attractive--as invisible girl special effects amazing fast pace movie never slows there well-executed elements humor moment involving an action figure nearly breaks fourth wall overall fun ride good
this movie was the best that i've seen year . i on edge of my seat for whole loved way they incorporated humour and action acting great , special effects were beyond belief don't know what people are thinking when say is boring can name movies not one do you even watch ? directing superb picked perfect actors to portray roles jessica alba fantastic playing invisible women really liked human torch wow a funny guy michael chickless did job got hand it them using lot cgi thing person who played doom hate villain so much want get rid him actor last buy least mr he too like said favorite scene battle between dr 4 sure thought himself think easy word describe ! goes right beside spiderman x-men am definately buying day comes out dvd heck may again in theaters ps : critics dumb good see won't be disappointed trust me
this is a true example of modern day sexual action classic . the storyline kept me on edge as to whether she was or wasn't killer sex scenes definitely gave hard
this is cronenberg at his best ! has anyone noticed the actors who appear in films generally put their greatest performances ? jeremy irons (dead ringers) , jeff goldblum (fly) peter weller (naked lunch) and james woods
this shouldn't be in sci fi , though it involves no magic . it's really psychological horror cronenberg who i'm now convinced was dropped on his head as an infant does the same thing another film of existenz but with virtual reality videodrome blurs personal identity and tethers its characters to psychosis brainwashing videotapes that ultimately along weird-ass score create new nauseating depths perversion cool blondie's she's cute
absolutly breathtakingly brilliant . a strange and dark science fiction nightmare cronenberg style utterly confusing down right creepy as hell , this movie will intrigue stun disgust leave you wondering what the is th new flesh ? along lines of david lynch who leaves to answer questions videodrome an honest god modern masterpiece contemporary highly recommended!!! !
one of the very best science fiction horror films ever made . david cronenbergs seminal film , deals with television addiction and hallucination james woods is lead actor tough superb special effects by rick bakers crew married to a rich script written cronenberg must see
the best i ever seen
incredible technique , wonderful eye-opener..definately a thriller
it's a great movie . i love lara croft and angelina jolie is sexy looks exactly like her the game are both
very sexy thriller that involved a good murder story with twisted ending was .
fantastic movie
good movie much better than the first one
i love this movie can see it since have not seen before
scary and good
the special effects are awesome , and plot is easier to understand than reloaded .
about a half an hour into the movie it abandons any notion of plot in battle zion . its explosions , debris and screaming was absolutly wonderful.from neo's crucifix pose to oracle end religious backround is also more obvious if youre hardcore fan matrix you will like this wierd thing isn't even best trilogy i could type hang lot but just go see
i see alot of people saying that this movie is a poor sequel . the acting was and cg wasnt as good second or it didnt come up to expectations thats really sad have nothing better do than break down every sequence in thier sequels rate like they know how should be made its gone from going , buying some popcorn watching end trilogy movies started 1997 ended 2003 which involved these worked harder each produce more stunning effects then did previously wow awesome your talking about where 80% done cgi.and zion fight scene totally mind blowing all could say holy crap freaking awesome.well not mention hard hell same keeping with scripts dialogue there are out deserve put but isnt rented seen on big screen cgi  required physical strengths abilities actors stuntmen programmers builders,designers,artists whole army 7 days week for an entire year move enjoyment you guys just sit piss moan sad.you complain characters die star trek ? no dont always live unless living fantasy land everything perfect.i knew neo trinity would part agent smith both were connected by only neo's .in order go fair share together because love other anyways deserves 5 stars 2 thumbs league lord rings wars if fell asleep likely attention span 3 old
great movie i dont no y ppl hated it perhaps they didnt understand but thot wuz brilliant and the matrix trilogy is 2nd best behind lord of rings .
i love this one  !
as always , keanu reeves shines and neo.. .
still trying to get my breath back from the action was great
this movie is fantastic . its a visual masterpiece that leaves you begging for more matrix movies the acting talented and storyline complex one of greatest sci-fi films created
loved it!! ! as the final installment in matrix trilogy , it was a perfect ending to an awesome story you definitely get your money's worth when go see this flick (which is hard these days with cost of movies) . scene overwhelmingly good and deep philosophical plot full-form best ever made...a real cinematic accomplishment that i'm proud brag about
some people may not agree with me for this rating,but i liked the movie very much.as soon as saw final battle between neo and smith it blew my mind.than zion,i first part where they go to save enter bar a fight breaks out.i like that one.i much
what i liked in braveheart is how much love he had for his wife , and when she died did not let her die nothing .
i loved it ! i'm a jp junkie .  : ) great effects and beautiful music the plot was , too but it's far from matching up to first beats second by mile though long live jurassic park!! oh #4 is supposedly going come out summer 2006 they've been rescheduling theatre realease date for some time bad news those who hated supposed be about dinos rampaging through north america let's hope they do better job
this movie was very entertaining and fun to watch but the first one will always be best .
although the first one was much , better this film i found to be very entetaining . of course few films will ever come close being as good jp so wouldn't mark tgis down just because it's predesscor had best special effects out three plot lacked only thing that pissed me off aboput movie spinosaurus defeated t-rex no way could happen ! some finned- fish eater can't take thanimal wuith strongest jaw in history thre world is a hard scene swallow for but overall did have what 2nd lacked- sam niell kinda man who makes it anyway and plus spielberg filmaker without doubt didn't direct you expect compete with fourth starting preproduction now are already fretting has up idea time michael crichton most likely writing it......so iun talks returning reprise his role alan grant again jeff golbloom richard attenborough finally original cast reunited those say series should ended universal contract from like 1992 they total os six movies made if sell well may renew further i'll get back at about jurassic park 12
one of my all time favourite movies , i would watch it over and again . love sean connery was really pleased to find out that he did alan quartermain this richard chamberlain might have been able pull off but not as well !
ok , it wasn't as good the comic book was based on - but still stood strongly far i concerned . in regards to dorian not averting his eyes when mina showed him picture think that is viable considering he hadn't seen for decades and lets face its hard look away someone showing you your soul effects were fantastic people who made hulk should check out this film see what have looked like...
great film that tosses reality out of the window with style . concept is superb and unique , bringing together lots characters from victorian novels there's some good touches humor special effects inspired action sequences acting all way around too can't wait for sequel
wow wonderful movie was pure enjoyment to watch and as all ways s . c at he's best
very fresh fantasy . takes an almost childlike , yet sophisticated approach to dark heroes the way we wanted see them before grew up and lost our sense of wonder using mostly villainous characters in protagonist roles makes seem more complex/realistic as people.good effects great dizzy pace-really fun !
at the movie theater-restaurant that i work part-time , collateral had an impressive seven-week run whereas most films last only two or three and are quickly replaced by newer movies (we have a limited number of theaters can accomodate profitable mainstream films) . ended up seeing it times -- some dialogue still gives me chills everything about is superbly done especially acting performances tom cruise jamie foxx this ranks as one my favorite would recommend to anybody who's looking for action thriller with brains
i was actually pulling for the predators to prevail . those nasty serpent-aliens must be stopped before whole of mankind is infected!! !
i've said it many times in my other reviews and sorry to regurgitate stale information , but i'm not a michael mann fan at all . hes done some really good work - ali that was i found hard appreciate the insider heat after watching collateral had strange appreciation for as director his past he worked three main characters tom cruise jamie foxx jada pinkett-smith know there are few reviewers on this site don't think highly of an actor when makes films like these you often wonder what more is capable doing made character vincent very humane by showing conscience has be one cruise's best performances along with jerry maguire magnolia born fourth july film well written superbly directed once actually believed hollywoods finest a-listers $30million bracket they looked scared movie if thrillers your going love even its worth seeing
i really enjoyed this movie ! believe is the best of 3 blade movies so far . liked introduction new characters to be helping , and thought soundtrack was awesome highly entertaining
i think it was a really clever action movie (compared to xxx , which good but not clever:) the only funny part bike chase scene bit average overall fantastic . highly enjoyed !
i thought this was a hysterical movie . haven't laughed that hard in long time the stayed reasonably true to book , though it's kind of tell (what with way twists and turns through story) marvin perfect they did zaphod little differently than expecting don't remember him ever losing his second head but been awhile since i've read books if you are fan is must see!! !
john carpenter is truly one of the kings horror!! ! roddy piper has long been my favorite wrestlers . chance to see him act could not be passed up this movie might some peoples high standards , but me you rate a on story acting and over all presentation time lines from any i came here kick ass chew bubble gum....and i'm out gum!! hell yeah
this movie scared the heck out of me . story was creepy , and idea being trapped on a haunted spaceship is just to interesting plot development
great movie , didn't love the idea for jason's character to die in pain like he did....i give jason a number one performance this movie... .
an a plus horrir movie . bit disgusting in many scenes i love the sets designs and all actos crews did fantastic job my favorite next to 'aliens' movies
a must if you like horror . i personally found that it was good movie , even though quite disgusting from time to but hey is what stands for ! the story well-written set great and actors do wonderful job
event horizon rules . one of the best sci-fi/horror/hounting movie set in outer space you ever get have to some guts see blood though , but it is not a about pure monster-less horror really hounted ! my sci-fi number #2 after matrix sadly there are people who don't think this way underrated
geena davis was great in this flick and well as samuel jackson . alot of action one , with a bit humor to go along the way from very complete movie
hilarious movie . excellent performances ! great special effects i loved the dragon and music : youre so beautiful david duchovny julianne moore are such a couple.i their acting
too funny to talk about . just watch it
i just finished studying the theory of evolution in my earth science class . found this movie to be pretty funny although it doesn't quite relate actual scientific you have give credit actors(actress) for portraying characters comic roles plus what more could ask from a , david duchovny orlando jones sean william scott and julie ann moore see such awsome same is rare sight one only movies that has
i saw this here movie just last night at one of them there dollar theaturs in my town and got to say think it was a great . am big fan david duchovny so real excited see him is funny intennse liked much cant even wate get on video aslo the make 7up yours guy that aliens were kind scarey but not nearly as ones seen life back 98
i just saw this movie with my friends and we laughed histerically throughout the whole thing ! am not too good w/ names...so dont remeber casts names but know stars of movie...there was david duchovny (howeva u spell it) , from x-files there is cute new star sean william scott . he very sexy!...hehe then orlando jones...now histerical now like a ghostbusters..its comedy adventure even dan ackroyd had part in it all monsters are interesting its really well done! oh goodness 1 where jones got alien bug his body (u may hav seen previews) to have pulled out funi walk 4 lil while...hahaha sooo funni!!! +neway wanna give away ne more movie.....just go c recommend  : o )
this movie was so asome and when it comes out on dvd iam going to get the first one selfs.i love plot added something new that game did not have .
milla jovovitch rules !
the movie had allot of action packed sceans . graphics where awsome and zombies really agile nemisis was well to great for anywords !
well , since i suggested this film suppose i'd better write a comment . strange days (if you haven't heard of it) stars ralph feinnes juliette lewis and angela bassett it is set in la during the final 1999 centers around lenny (fiennes) who sells 'clips' (people put an electrical device on their head called squid records images emotions) he's still love with his ex faith (lewis) nasty situation her record company owner boyfriend milo then plot gets thicker... won't tell rest because it'll ruin quite dark has superb soundtrack skunk anansie (yes girl can really sing) others very moving scenes concepts that will leave gobsmacked ending so wonderful warms your heart - end credits have great b/w stills from if seen suggest do regret (i hope)
has a great sound track and the best bond film that roger moore starred in . must see for all fans boat chase is one of chases movie history
dated , but maximillian (the big red robot) was cool . kind of like a 50's movie in the 70's..
absolutely loved this movie as a kid . watched it until the tape wore out
great job jason ! always a fan of yours , jo.. .
more complex enjoyment from mr . gilliam this one had a better cast than time bandits , and you could see the director letting them loose on occasion almost caught yourself reading movie as its fairy-tale sets effects evoked child-like wonderment all about dream-like in places i get kick out of it every
holy craparoonie!! ! why is this animated slice of nirvana far back ? granted , it came out awhile ago but stick on a plasma screen and watch dazzle your retinas! old-school showcase for meticulous paintwork that still can't be done computer to any satisfying length . what suffers in cultural curiosities more than made up sheer scope chutzpah count me an avowed fan
this was a good movie , the acting little over top and dialog some what corny but it gave 1940's feel . story is believable effects were great why has there not been sequal or tv version update : their looked like done on cheap which i have seen yet
this movie rocks ! i enjoy the special effects and characters some of scene in such as lightning destroying stone buildings rome microwaves golden gate bridge are a little far-fetched but is addictive . you can learn about what inside our earth looks like by watching
gloria hendry is an exceptional talent . jane seymour should lay off the max factor
a great movie with the obvious lesson that no matter where you come from can still choose to walk path of virtue . title character be harsh but has some quirks make him lovable guy'll drink beer and smoke cigars will also have milk cookies kid after saving kittens i wouldn't recommend this for ctvfan knowing he'd rate poorly based on alone instead he would claim lacks morals fails family friendly
this movie is life changing , i hope that someone actually writes an analysis of . i'm interested to see how other people interpreted it best if watched very late at night and after drinking coffee with a small number
this is not what you d expect from linklater . i m one of those people that was too impressed with either slacker or dazed and confused sure , they were entertaining good stoner flicks but far brilliant maybe missing something so expected similar waking life really amazed movie extraordinary ! the animation thing quite new for me it works well whole plays like a dream montage everything also fits together seamlessly into leaves wondering about lot things definitely am glad to own because going have revisit parts get better understanding some philosophical concepts addressing
intriguing , thought-provoking philosophical
a classic 80's movie
high noon in space . frankly , i like it better than the characters are more compelling
the picture was stunningly beautiful with impressive cinematography , action lively great special effects acting realistic and believable plot touching yet simple . it's a fantastic film that everyone should see !
although i'm scratching my head at the pg-13 rating for this tame movie , i must say enjoyed it throughly (to surprise both parents as well!) . a fan of cartoon series (i had never seen first movie) was not dissappointed big aliens hilarious banter and pop references (from star trek to weather channel) are just awesome plus on dvd blooper reel rocks ! highly recommended
i really never make it a habit to watch period movies , but since mel gibson was in decided . the action great blood battles storyline whole movie winner
i thought the action scenes were great . although overall film did move a bit slow , so life aboard ship at that time
great return ! hope their are more .
this movie had it all . action , special effects comedy and attractive women stupid bad guys a monster that is unlike anything i have seen before suprise ending rate as must see flick one of the best ever suprising considering treat williams was star
this is a great movie! !
spectacular story line and breath taking scenes . shortly , just great!! !
please don't ask me why i love this movie so much (after close to 120 viewings , you'd think i'd be ready pitch it through a window!) . all know is that after checking most everything out there the ice pirates stands up as mack daddy king mamma-jamma of "good bad" films doesn't look like anything else before or with herky-jerky effects wide-ranging sets and weirdly-lit camera work acting ranges from lukewarm obvious inspired silliness (coming slightly-askew cast includes bob urich ron perlman anjelica huston) one few mary crosby vehicles well (i've always had an unhealthy obsession ms ; might hair crooked smile uneven eyes etc.) great supporting players in john matuszak (who holds honor being more movies than anyone else) seinfeld bit-character michael d roberts ever-annoying (but fairly funny here) bruce vilanch plot.....well it's basic damsel-in-distress scenario too many continuity holes plug 5000-word space suffice say nothing that'll bring little gold statues one's trophy case what will harmless smirk your face lasts hour-and-a-half abominable ambrosia
i loved this movie ! found it original and fresh with marvelous actors like christian bale a uniqur storyline .
it was nominated for a few oscars reason . nice main plot , good subplots too russell crowe did great job in the movie if you like historical fiction this is
i absolutely love this film . there are only about 20 movies in my collection that watch over and , is one of them like the ambience/atmosphere/sense place makers have created for both earth mars okay some science wrong but who cares ? if you want don't look at sci-fi because little think actual physics a transporter beam ha ! interaction characters mtm very sweet romantic relationship between married couple also an interesting character has lost his wife thing irritates me movie whoever did make-up was too heavy-handed with eye certain scenes
this was simply a great movie . brought out the former sailor in me and back memories of what its like to be at sea if you want full effect , see it on big screen
this movie is great .
great movie  ! tim robbins is always so gut.... . the end special vive !!!!
another fantastic movie
they shot this outside my apartment for a while , so i had some personal interest in it . trivia fact : the cops' badges read nowhere city nifty ! movie is lot lighter than all other versions of story and guy pearce more accessible george pal or cheesy mustache who played inventor 70s version also his character gets name dinner party guests were known only by their professions book are subtracted there's new romance best buddy both well morlocks very scary hive reminiscent scenes from aliens  constructed eloi sleepy sun people play angels to morlocks' devils illustrate think compellingly flaws society that entirely innocent positive still being desirable alternative why apparently based on maori unknown me it's not huge action but drama wonder there even as jeremy irons's super-evil baddie slithers sulks way around screen reminds those great old mgm classics fine family picture quiet evening at home
wow , this movie sure is being hated upon ! not all movies were made to teach a deep and resounding lesson . some put on earth simply entertain i think definently accomplishes that yeah lot of guys want get into jane fonda's plastic duds but that's only because she one kick-ass evil fighting princess the effects are so goofy (the mathmos cracks me up every time)and acting campy has keep in mind roger vadim film it's also 70's b-movie it was ahead time still staying true sci-fi roots people go watching expecting shaking spectacular-of course they going be disapointed there much about makes entertaining-not necessarily 'good' entertaining music cute blind angel dude black tyrant lady keeps calling barbie pretty kitty  darn bird attack hairy man who lives what looks cornucopia-how could help love ? if ever need cheering i'll just pop again will well with world
anyone , and i mean who has ever been accused of road-rage should love this movie . sure the cars are nightmarishly cheesy stallone proved to seen that he can't act but is awesome in a futuristic society death race main spectator sport supported by government loved everyone even victims ! mind-blowing concept pop it watch real classic (hey sis how much for dirtbag on corner?)
oh yeah good movie
this is easily the best movie that i've seen in years . brilliantly creative and awesomely stylized , amazing creation should sweep oscars year (although spider-man 2 might put up a good fight) acting great with jude law playing hero beautiful gwenyth paltrow lois lane-type action combat scenes are astounding rival those of original star wars episodes voyager enterprise dialgoue lots humor sprinkled throughout--including an uproarious running gag involving camera imagination seemingly boundless as robots planes sea vehicles air bases more lurk around every corner classic story vs evil sky captain world tommorow could be 2004
a classic .
braveheart was a good action movie that had historical background . i liked the fighting scenes and they were very graphic there romance makes for everyone
i give planet of the apes(2001)five stars , it is one best sci-fiction films( next to star wars) . 's my favorite movie so far end may not make sense some people but still a good film and worth watching part in movie,is where general thade (tim roth) looks right at leo davidson (mark wahlberg)and said this looked me ..i loved that apes (2001)rulez!! !
the best movie ever made in history of movies along with original and star wars . unforgettable lines , twists characters fullfill this to its
planet of the apes rocks ! lots action , great story and incredible acting . i don't know what you all are talking about with th 3 star ratings was around for first wave this is so much better very realistic production cannot wait to get my hands on dvd
it's a highly underrated star trek movie ! after saving earth from the alien probe in st:iv , enterprise crew is on vacation but soon they will find themselves out to rescue ambassadors taken hostage planet of galactic peace . humor this one driving forces as well interaction between kirk spock and mccoy special effects (especially ones spacedock) are excellent acting great plot solid
oh yeah ! lost in space rules i am a huge fan of the tv show , and even though movie is very different it's still lot fun to watch . gary oldman was good choice for dr smith but if there's sequel hope they take out that stupid yellow creature only annoying part overall it has cast pretty story unbelievable effects ton cool action i'd love see
great special effects , sci-fi and elizabeth shue is hot .
very suspenseful with an interesting cast . i liked it a lot
i thought it was great . the special effects were good
i like hollow man because the graphics are exciting , and it makes you feel is someone invisible watching me ?
the epic chronicling life and events of scottish legend william wallace , braveheart is beautifully contructed . mel gibson put on a career performance in this one both behind front camera movie will make you laugh cry cringe disgust what else could ask for ? was best 90's
loved it . my best friend refused to watch in the summer for longest time because we live canadian praries and she was so scared that a tornado going come here but where hasn't had over 100 years i do not know what is worried about
the special effects were great . i liked story there a lot of heartstopping scary parts kevin bacon did good job in this movie couldn't even tell it was computer generated
i dont care what anyone says this is a great movie!i am girl loved it , because its got kicking guys butts . thats one of the many good parts about saw sunday after came out wanna see again soo mean ya corny yes but supposed to be like video game just knowing that excuses cornyness better new movies special effect are as excellent movie there really no plot never either and angelina jolie sooo she pulls off accent being cool at same time if you want action packed my favorite tomb raider rules ! all people who sux bad well come on get grip was made for entertainment make money reason so popular does have big boobs part go pay not classic film duh huh besides every cant were then we wouldnt appreciate ones deserve called classics also music :) recomend apparantly more brains than us likers
i dont caree if you say no plot , acting boring can't put a price on cute as hell girl who ends up beating everybody's ass ! all losers beter shut with your complainin' and see this movie it was made true entertainment!! got that ? good.shut .
freakin great film , never got bored during at all i only wished for more and . halli was excelent with her charactor of the charactors had an effect on you either liked them or hated them(not hating becuase think movie sucked beucase like evil that character overall this needs a second one because walked out theaters cat crazy ready to climb walls
the movie was worth seeing , not just because halle wearing a skin tight outfit but it has good storyline and is quites comical . also gives an interesting twist to actual story of how catwoman came about
i love movies where it is man vs . nature the images of tornados in movie were breathtaking find twisters and fascinating
great stuff...... .
this is a great action movie . i love how the characters are so vivid and unique storyline ; but even moreso , special effects awesome ! those twisters looks real acting believeable one of best scenes course flying cow (watch out for it if you haven't seen it) scene at end twister was literally unbelieveable nice nonetheless
this was a great movie . not only entertaining but it actually taught me thing or two as well kept wondering what going to happen next that many films can do these days my attention and in the end , had routing for scientists flick !
the special affects were astounding (better than most high budget films) and acting reflected tones that a d player speaks acts when playing game . i liked how they had richard o'brien maze in antius city (for those who have not been out of us , hosted show called crystal maze)
this would be the first movie of its kind as far i have seen and they did fairly good , it been better if hadn't made a kids .
wasn't expecting very much but was suprised . enjoyed the action and effects great visaully , makes for a fun night at movies
the only reason why i give this movies a 5 is because of aaliyah.i mean she was best actress in movie to me!everyone else sucked!but music cool!but saw it her and did great job !
mel gibson is the best actor in world , and one of my favorite movies he made was braveheart . that only movie me cry
i liked how everything in the movie seemed so real . special effects were great and was entertaining this gave me a view of twister might be like i'm glad live california where there are not any tornadoes
flawless entertainment . john travolta shows his immense complexity as an alien performance is so convincing he may actually be one forest whitaker i know because starred in ghost dog recommend this film to everyone (who also likes stick forks up their butts.)
awesome - the book is incredible and although movie was somewhat skewed it still had fantastic effects
the suspense in this movie was great . it had a good storyline and you got interested characters wasn't violent i liked that not too many people died even though two groups were competing against each other hated , main character still tried to save mean guy's life
twister was good . i liked the cows that flew around ; it cool movie made me want to chase tornados always make movies
i like the gore and violence . acting it was a great movie
this is a great movie . it has lot of action , but what i like most all was how realistic the story and those special effects
story of stormchasers was great . example competition between two teams special effects
i loved braveheart . liked the fact that everyone got killed thought mel gibson did a great job acting
awsome movie
this movie really surprised me . it was a gritty realistic and violent gem denzel kicked ass total bad who had nothing to lose
denzel exploded onto the screen . this was an amazing movie reading other comments , i can understand why people pull their hair out we are all so completely different in our expectations for those of you who agree with me and loved kudos thought it bad clearly weren't watching same
i love this move so much .
there is only one alamo movie . the john wayne classic
great movie
good action , drama and great special effects .
excellent movie in many ways . acting was terrific kostner did great job directing only flaw unrealistic delays from gun report to impact bullets could be thrown at that velocity !
very good movie . duvall is one of the best great action in this
this is an example of superior filmmaking and acting in a genre that doesn't get much play anymore . costner back on the map after several forgettable films hope he continues to find material like suit his talents
fantastic
this movie surprised me -- it was actually very good . i didn't think i'd enjoy a western , but one had captivated there not only the usual beautiful scenery and gunfights also some wonderful cowboy humor that cracking up whole time
this movie is awesome and conner murphy are fine as hell the old bartender man!!!! ! always remember...don't cross road if you can't get out of kitchen
i think this movie is one of the best movies made . it has great action and wonderful twists within plot
brilliant plot , lots of action- you really get caught up in it all . this film is at the top my favorites list
quite possibly the best cult movie ever . no offense to rocky horror but come on let's be honest here
tons of action and lots humor . gore language , so if that turns you off than dont waste your time but its comedy then pick this one up
this is my favorite movie of all time . the acting good plot everything battle scenes are very lifelike
the greatest movie ever made , there is not a singe flaw at any point,there needs to more movies like this
this is the best movie jackie chan and chris tucker are so funny i'm glad they r coming out wit a sequel! !
i thought this was a pretty good movie . it's funny and it has some action scenes as well is for anyone who likes comedy movies you get both genres the price of one in
mel gibson puts on an inspiring performance as william wallace . the battle scenes in this movie are most amazing ever speeches and acts of selflessness highlight overriding theme freedom
i did not want to see this movie at all , but really enjoyed it once watched .
i searched for this movie high and low - finally got it (on video) . my daughters enjoy jackie's movies very much one is favorite laughed throughout the whole jackie owen should go another great like especially no sexual scenes , (excessive) abusive speech thanks
this movie was really cool!! !
this movie , i think is one of the best action movies have ever seen . mel gibson great in and it packed with
it was the best movie i have ever seen funny when guy gave him chop-sticks to dig himself out and outher peed on his shirt
this a wonderful movie . well duh jackie chan is in it
very inventive
this was a movie that touched your heart . just how mel gibson portrayed william wallace outstanding and it made you hate the british after
i loved the skewbald horse and because i'm going to live in shanghai it was just good watch some of thier history . story-line geat very funny places as well having my hero/idol actor owen wilson on most movies you can sometimes tell what's happen noon unexpecting things alot
 .
it's jacky chan ! he is hilarious . i think this movie even better than rush hour just plain fun you'll laugh your way through the
this was an excellent movie . probably one of jackie chan's best ever ! the plot funny and stunts were i'm not really into western movies but is a definite must see
this movie was the best i've seen year . it is so funny and action great i recommend that everyone of any age should watch in theaters
i love this movie . it's funny and has lots of laughter throughout the there is actions jackie made really fun enjoyable
a great comedy of old western times . i love what if movies , especially they have historical background jackie chan was but his sidekick lacked good emotional usage face and body again looking girls helped the quality movie
this is the best action thriller movie . if you are into bloody battles and heroes watch
this one is great ! it not because i am a fan of jackie chang , but its style humorous and light . very impressive chang's series won't let you get tired
loved this movie . no reviews or people anything can change my ming jackie and owen made a great team with his moves own stunts (no stuntdouble) talking way through everything is also really hot
not a huge fan of the always screaming samuel l jackson but this movie is fantastic . kevin spacey and build up with so much suspense that i could turn away from tv must see
i love this guy he is so asome how batman would be if was half human and vanpire .
better than the original . fight scenes were awesome and reapers werecreepy origional reaper epidemic shows you what happens when try to play god without getting too preachy like jurassic park
nice fight scenes! ! very cool effects! some gross gore! awesome soundtrack! seriously , why else would anyone watch this movie ?
very cool !
awesome , action . not as fast-paced 'resident evil' but all around a much better movie scariest ickiest vampires since 'salem's lot.' nice to see horror/action movies getting back basics the cgi blade in battles was totally believable new 'reaper' themselves were excellent crawled like insects swarmed serpents i never rated first film if had would have given it four or possibly five stars deduction because essentially just comic book this one has extra dimensions and smoother plot also doesn't resort at any point did your mom which is probably good thing here too worth wait disappointment
i loved watching braveheart . watched it at least eight times mel gibson is a really good actor and he did job directing the film think one of greatest action movies ever
i loved this movie . alright , ya it was freaky kinda weirded me out at times....but the plot great ! it's a classic thriller villan definetly scarey and we could feel for j-lo but if you are easily freaked its not
this is an awesome movie ! it so innovative and original . i haven't seen anything else like some people seem to think that j lo was bad in , but thought her acting strong she also very sexy the directing really impressive too story good pretty chilling exciting has bitching visual effects only part of didn't intestine scene one just sick besides a great its my favorites 2000
graphics look realistic . images of life the storyline is good and interesting
the best film in whole series .
great movie with a love story in it . bloody and romantic- something for guys girls long too so you get what pay
this movie just took me to a whole different universe . even though it was viciously disturbing , everything else perfect jennifer lopez for the role and did an excellent job creative mystical sci-fi thriller is great watch(just not with your little sister)
a very good movie . it shows the mind of killer and how he became like that acts way does points to childhood could help society see what murderers serial killers go through in life become showed thaa everyone has innocence family affects you act think
jennifer lopez is hot . this movie tripped out never seen anything like it
this is the best movie i've ever seen . its old school combat off hook and queen hella fine
i thought this movie was very good . it deep liked at the end how jennifer lopez killed bad guy that actually saving him visual effects were cool too
great action scenes , lot of blood and guts . mel gibson was
jennifer lopez made this movie great . although i didn't understand what was going on a lot of the time , it worth for
the cell what can i say it was best scary i've seen all year
the only thing that i can say about breave heart is movie of all time .
lopez is a great actress . the special effects were amazing i really got into story plot
this is a very well done sci-fi flick . it has fascinating premise which explored and great special effects also horror movie , however some really upsetting gruesome scenes
this was a demented and twisted movie done right . from the first second of film i completely into it grabs your attention holds whole way through even though plot is totally unrealistic , possibility that makes you wonder what goes on in our subconscious unconscious mystery to all us one interpertation might be lying underneath most creative movies have seen years beautifully with scenes elements come together colors music acting were great cinemotography along photography exceptional scary but weird as already stated so visually stimulating had there not been dialogue would still able understand after left don't think spoke ride home almost too much digest dreams for past two nights highly recommend long stomach pyschotic thrillers
really loved this excellent film . wonderful acting by great stars susan flannery !
what a great movie ! so much suspense and various storylines woven through it all . excellent acting by golden globe to susan flannery
this is an excellent movie and mel gibson's finest . don't be scared away by the length of film it has great action flies you'll also amazed how large battles scenes are they may have a little too much violence for some , but truly tremendous directorial feat braveheart funny at times lot heart
one of the classic susoense movies ! it still gives me nightmares sometimes .
the best of 70's disaster flicks . paul newman , steve mcqueen etc..
great film - does not need a re-make . rutger hauer at his best!! !
great and creepy film . rutger hauer is especially as the pyschotic hitchiker from hell it also teaches an important lesson too.. never pick up a
good advice !
excellent suspense thriller . very graphic , fine acting by hauer and howell just when you think it's stopped.. who knew hbo was good for anything ? he couldn't walk far why not because i cut off his legs arms head i'm going to do the same kids don't pick up hitchhikers especially if they want die take a lot of people with them that dialogue spoken in car drop rain hanging like sanity rutger hauer's nose thunderstorm middle nowhere atmosphere can't beat it
an amazing film . braveheart has a little bit of everything - love , vengeance patriotism loyalty betrayal and it is all carried off beautifully by mel gibson in his role as william wallace leader the scottish resistance against british rule unlike many current movies violence actually seems to fit plot battle scenes are shockingly realistic i found myself believing that strength charisma intensity one man could turn tide battles were decided will more than anything else can't wait see this movie again
what a great movie this is . i haven't seen it in long time , but remember being one creepy flick.. two scenes particular really scared me - the where c thomas howell looks out of car he riding to see rutger hauer station wagon with family kids sitting on his lap.. you just know that something terrible going happen most memorable scene from may have been getting an order fries at diner only find... well won't give away very scary done
amazing movie . sustains an almost unbearable level of tension the entire running time.this was first for a lot people : eric red , who wrote and directed cinematographer whose name slips my mind mark isham composer rutger hauer is flawless in title role c thomas howell just good but story direction are so strong it doesn't matter at glance simple thriller it's really about master/apprentice father/son relationship never seen that done
one of the all time greats ! michael caine and sean connery . john huston adapted story into a feature film starring as daniel dravot , peachey carnehan christopher plummer rudyard kipling now what could be better in an old fashioned adventure yarn ? while at offices northern star newspaper is approached by ragged seemingly crazed derelict who reveals himself to his acquaintance peachy carnahan tells how he cohort danny traveled remote kafiristan become gods ultimately lose everything after meeting office few years earlier signing contract pledging mutual loyalty muster army from natives village their first battle decide that god shot with arrow chest but continues fighting fact has struck bandolier beneath clothing lodged it don't know this when they arrive holy city sikandergul confuse masonic medals for symbols alexander great declare men delusions grandeur wants sneak out chests gold jewels decides take wife amongst much against peachy's advice ; chooses roxanna (played caine's real-life shakira) fears no woman can live if consort so tries escape biting him process bite draws blood see realise human pursue through streets erstwhile kingdom killed forced walk middle rope bridge over deep canyon ropes supporting are cut falls death tortured released end finishes presents danny's decaying head still wearing its kafiri crown
i am a huge sean connery and michael caine fan , so to have both in the same movie was absolutely amazing fantastic for me . had only seen clips of this from documentaries that watched about thought it looked absoltely hilarious then came on over christmas year after yet another documentary loved every single minute follows two main characters (connery caine) their quest become rich live like kings when they get back london but connery's character gets mistaken god wears crown upon his head power goes he refuses leave even though riches always dreamed won't say how ends as don't want give whole storyline away acting is plot script definately one you can watch again
one of the few movies in my life that i have watched multiple times , and shared with many people . early 80's read a review stated this was considered best movie all times!! ! humphrey bogart originally chosen for role sean connery played making 30 years
my favorite and great movie!because actor is mel gibson .
i can't believe how low this is . an awesome movie
this movie , gone in 60 seconds...kicks ass.. ! nicholas cage did some awesome high speed driving flick to the point of leaving me wondering...did he study under steve mcqueen?? ? is that it cause that's really saying something when comes a car as skillfully . now then if you want sit on tip your chair cold sweat watching flick...simply go out and buy or rent copy dvd ...do hometheater works will blow seat...promise
for someone who owns an old muscle car , this movie is awesome . my foot always seems a bit heavier after watching and they def picked the right actor part
angie jolie kicks ass in this movie ! it rox! :)
what more could you want! ? 50 sweet cars , great action actors.(go cage!) this movie is !
this movie was sooooo awsome cars yaaaahooooo
as a fast car nut , i had goose pimples when eleanor started up . the movie was outrageous all have to say is sequel???? ?
i can watch this movie over and . really liked it still get chills when william wallace yells....'freedom' mel gibson is now making 'the patiriot' which seems like will be 'braveheart' during the revoluntionary war
this movie is awsome . he steals 50 cars in one night ! the beat part was when 67 shelby mustang gt500 (eleanor) i wish a chase going at 120 mph with nitrous doing all burnouts sliding around turns then jumping car nicolas cage best that
i loved the movie ! cage and jolie were excellent! it's my new favourite movie!
the movie was excellent . i have a beef with mr bruckheimer , did he actually think car buffs would not notice that resurrected eleanor is mercury cougar xr7 and even stang ! maybe should hire someone little continuity still good just disappointed about ending
i just saw gone in 60 seconds this last weekend . it is one of my new favorite movies and even picked up on dvd the chase scene awesome so are cars great movie !
hell yeah ! this movie was soo good i thought everyone that played in it looked and acted . like jumpy , funny,action all at the same time nicholas cage is sooo hot
this is the most insane movie in thw world . girls are hot and nicholas cage an awsome acter get it on dvd i bought first day came out if your to cars then you should go right now not , great !
this movie puts you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end . it's fast pace equally matches speed cars , and all without losing plot detail i found that while dramatic action filled still intertwined a sense comedy
action packed and exciting . the cars were da bomb angelina jolie ! never a dull moment
after watching the patriot  , i wanted to see some of mel gibson's movie and rented braveheart . although liked better was great film too
this movie was great because it had lots of action . also , i loved the cars that came out on in speed and thrills

great movie . a lot of action , different from other rambo shooting movies if you like cars you'll love this very funny
fast paced and with plenty of excitement . touches humor , if you like classic beautiful cars you'll love this movie
how rare is it to come across an oscar-worthy action movie , let alone one that appeals both men and women ? braveheart a creation . mel gibson who also directed the brings spirit of william wallace life i have no sense historical accuracy it's always kind annoying when movies portray entire country (england in this case) as 100% evil but other than has few flaws great scenes high quality acting two beautiful dramatic story with good guys root for bad hate - all including message about freedom somehow manages get through without being overly corny even like gladiator can't hold candle further testimony gibson's achievement
the acting was great . story line pretty good lines were well thought out sound track is , two songs are overall one of my favorite movies i found movie to be very funny at times as
great movie for those who like action and fast cars . this has throughout the whole also , is easy to follow
engrossing from start to finish - exellent film
the punisher is one bad ass they way he kills all i can say a arts .
outstanding !
the.. . z slice it's mark once again on to the cinema screens... ! this story and theme was so well produced character more than came life screen zorro himself much better portrayed those of many years ago his daughter , i don't wish perterb her father by mentioning how incredibly pretty she in movie but a bit graphic realism violence dept worth watching
one of my favorite movies . but , then again i have always been a sucker for westerns! !
great movie . keeps you guess until the end plus , angelina is a actress even if she's bit rough around edges
drew barrymore's best film since e.t.!!!in this film,she was kinda like charlie mcgee as an adult!!!especially the scene where she riding a scooter with her hair flowing in wind!!!she sexy angel!!!the movie had terrific storyline and plot,and i loved bill murray bosly! !
a really fun movie . the action scenes were great !
braveheart is a bad ass movie
i had real reservations about this film . usually don't enjoy much that drew berrymore and cameron diaz do was totally shocked movie absolutely rocks the perfect mix of humor , action camp sex appeal my wife bought it as soon came to dvd we never seem get tired watching
this is one of my favorite movies , i have seen it so many times but never gets old because it's got three girls who dress fashionably and can kick some major butt
thought it was really cool . love the outfits funny at times but is more of an action movie i like fact that these girls are smart , still pretty and can kick people's butts !
this is a very entertaining movie if you leave your commen sense at the theatre door . my real rating would be 4 1/2 stars !
one of the best triumphant and heartbreaking movies i've ever seen
the movie was great ! martial arts looked sort of fake at sometimes but it still
this ws the greatest action movie ever! ! stunts were great and it was just totally awesome!
that movie was the best ! it funny too lol i love richard 4 lyf!!!!!
best movie ive ever seen ! its full of fun,fun and fun it 4 times i still love will never get boring live in england so unfortunately not out on video yet but when comes definately all about women kicken mens asses ladies your boots is such an inspiration nothing could be better
i love the movie and drew barrymore was hilarios good .
sounds great ! i'm one lol i wanna see it
braveheart is by far the best action movie to date ! it's long , but definatly worth time
this movie has it all!! ! 3 independant women who not only look hot 24/7 they also have the intelligence and ability to back up , mention fact can seriously kick ass!! 10 out of made me proud be a woman cameron diaz brought new meaning robot . absolutely love movie!
i thought this movie was great ! went into it just for lucy liu , but found out that diaz and barrymore can be angels as well . will hopefully go see again with my girlfriend lui if you read this...i love you!!!!
anyone expecting something really deep will be disappointed . i thought this movie was excellent great action , characters .. the weren't too serious making fun of themselves esp natalie (diaz) heaps go and see it !
the thin man rocks
wow! ! this move it terrific!! makes feel proud to be a woman!! you go girls!!!!
braveheart is such a great movie . mel gibson acted directed outstandingly the story was , as well cast
this movie was definately the bomb!!!! ! i think people of all ages will enjoy action packed movie!! men they're getting a bunch hot women in scimpy clothes , about women's rights and independence . three angels are great actresses make hit!! would recommend to anyone lookin' for time!!
the movie was action packed , and suspenseful . with lucy cameron drew up front who wouldn't want to see this ?
i thought braveheart was great b/c it full of action and the plot had accurate details about what going on at that time
i thought that this movie was the best . love drew barrymore , and cameron diaz wasn't too bad my mom surprised me by taking would have goen to see it anyday then going bowling with friends so cool natalie (cameron diaz) just loved shake her butt in spiderman underwear
how can any man not like it . has hot girlz and very action packed
don't go to this film expecting anything deep . take it for what is and enjoy the ride get overly critical about some of technical stuff (like friends mine!) ; that would be like complaining script quality a saturday morning cartoon action really gets blood going humor keeps movie fresh fun it's great show catch if your looking out have good time with , those kids probably worry pg-13 rating (some violence might too much young ones) all in entertainment i'd easily recommend my
i saw this movie on friday , saturday and sunday!!! ! was the best have ever seen in any category! wanna be an angel charlie call me!!
i am ready to quit my job as a nurse and become one of charlie's angels .
the best movie i ever seen
this was the best action packed adventure movie i have seen in a long time . jackie chan move over ! these ladies are hot and they you sitting on edge of your seat although know it fantasy , strangely made me proud to be woman way go drew cameron lucy!!!
i loved this movie!! ! will definetly go see it again . when left the theatre wanted to sign up for some martial art classes!! they could not have picked a better cast!! want be an angel!!!
one of the best movies i've ever seen ! i loved it . it's like matrix and james bond mixed , but with girls
i really liked this movie . it had action and stuff hate cameron diaz (not really) because she is so pretty thanx !
the wallace version of events , course which i was first exposed to at glasgow univ . however wonderfully done mr gibson did a fantastic believable job
great film . norton did an excellent job when he played the spazzy brian i felt a bit deceived by billing though angela bassett was touted as major player in , but she little more than prop mean story could have been just effecitve without her very under-used age and treachery will overcome youth inexperience
bad boysii has non-stop action and comedy now how is the first better then that .
great sequal , best on screen duo action and funny so where are the oscars huh or some kind of award . but car chase scene was a little long
5 stars...but only (and i do mean 'only') because of the scene where both martin and smith are in electronics store !
a great aciton movie .
this movie will always be a classic .
braveheart was the best . good actors , plot etc
this movie is funny!!!! ! it was alot better than the first one . of action i highly recommend
i was on the edge of my seat great movie
too funny , action scenes were off the hook cannot wait for a part three . i love will smith and martin lawrence...bad boys bad what you gonna do...-go see it is worth money -victrolalights-
without a doubt , pierce brosnan's best bond outing . fine plot top-notch supporting cast (stand up dame judi and sean bean) terrific special effects classic title track it's the of all possible bondian worlds
loved it the best of all them
yeah , it's just an action moive but i love it ! pierce brosnan is as good a 007 any in my eyes . enjoyed the actors well plot (which some would say non existant) this movie has that classic bond vibe
the new millennium james bond : suave , debonair overall macadacious player who saves world gets girl and stops worlds most dangerous psychos all in an afternoon.. . still has time to have a martini at dinner party
james bond is the cleanest fool that i've ever seen . all in one day he kills hella bad guys , gets girl plays with sorts of cool weapons and still has time to get a drink(shaken not stirred)
james bond is just tight ! all of the movies are dope greatest secret agent since inspector gadget . i love gadgets and cool cars
this is a must see ! it has been one of my alltime favorite movies .
nice adaption of the game . this does justice to james bond movie four player option is lots replay value
one of the best james bond movies! ! a must for lovers :)
my favorite paranoid conspiracy film . cameo by harrison ford as a young corporate villain quite the cast
one of my favourite movies . hackman brilliant as the neurotic snoop , and entire theme mystery wrapped in an enigma cloaked a riddle is fascinating
the conversation directed by coppola is not propely an action movie ; even a true thriller . but one of best movies ever made
excellent movie - a wonderful manifestation of the legend/history him .
good.nuff said .
karin dor is amazing .
barbara bach deserves an oscar for the scene in pyramids . that dress
braveheart has all the ingredients for a great action movie - blood , mel gibson romance freedom !
yes , i give it a five . is one of those movies for all time does stand the test ? believe so simply because it's message michael knight probably best known from tv show houston knights takes lead role and an adequate job really enjoyed way movie showed each characters struggles with not only rival gangs but their own emotions relays good sting together to survive kind
this is one of my favorite movies . ive seen it many times over the years since came out 20 ago its a surreal look at new york gang life warriors and every other in were invited to send 9 delegates from their represent them meeting called by cyrus head biggest he wanted try unite everyone so they could take whole city but what happens scumbag lowlife shoots all hell breaks loose cops begin showing up keep blame him starts yelling pointing leader who had been seperated his friends that was shot then surrounded though not shown you know has beat death remaining now have make back coney island middle night truce on when went off dont yet looking for including ones killed gangs meet with are strange meant be exxagerations scene train those couples get like just prom fear misunderstanding quickly next stop girls drops flower swan picks gives girl managed tag along journey me says no place judge if haven't walked mile shoes most people couldn't handle walking block i would never wish anyone curse nobody better than else we different lives made choices
funniest gangs ever . the baseball gang , rollerskating kids of hippy chicks and dirty mods not to mention those skid marks shouting warriors.. come out play ! all them dangerous.. deadly hahahaha yo man why can't today's be more colourful like these ones ? oh wait that's right colours is what their about now
one of the best bond films ever . pierce brosnan is everything a should be and halle berry bond-girl story has some nice little twists john cleese wonderful as q's replacement r whole subway scene real third man feel to it toby stephens mediocre villain , but rosamund pike his accomplice : car fight
the best bond movie ever . i loved it
i loved this movie
james bond is the bomb!!!! !
that movie was like soo hott. . halle lookded madd pretty and she kicked some ass!!!!!. 5 stars!!!!!'!'!'''''
this movie was an action-packed film that kept me interested throughout.halle berry cool and so pierce brosnan(who happens to be as smooth ever a womanizer).i agree with the opinionater down below who said madonna's drab theme music bad.i personally think they should stick orchestras .
great ambience and a stellar ensemble .
one of the most entertaining films i've ever seen . original plot , complex great acting halle barry and fun although abit disturbing considering recent terrorist events well worth buying
i love this movie cause halle berry is in it!shes a very smart,funny,and sexy actress she really done good!although its not major fav good even though people down it they don't have tatse anyway of what real movies are !
i liked this movie ! john travolta's a god don't exactly know what it was , maybe hally barry's tits cool cars or the good action but really .
gladiator is one of the best movies i've seen when it comes to time gladiators,and romen empire was said be . moves pretty fast so you dont get bored like some other plot neat crowe starts out as general becomes a slave then and upsets have love
extremely entertaining..i just think marky mark is so cute. .
this was a really great movie . what made it interesting the fact that true story i think george clooney did very good job in
most of u guys are idiots please people dont know a good movie if it hit in the face perfect storm was fantastic best this year and for many years im fisherman from newfoundland sword so real amazing everything dead on acting spactacular just way us liveid give 10 out 0f 5 i could ignorant executive type sit back enjoy ride because poor hard working class finally get some credit put that your cuban cigar smoke to go hollywood great job
i thought the movie was brilliant.the kid who played murph's son looked like aaron carter(the singer) wonder if it him...oh well . this amazing , hope you see
maximus is the man
this true story was excellent . the actors took you with them on their trip george clooney best actor they could have picked to play captain of ship and crew movie been just a little better , but other than that great if haven't seen it go see now
this was an excellent movie . i did not know much about the plight of commercial fishermen , but after watching moved to learn more
it was a powerful movie suited for almost any person . i went against my will but pleasantly surprised george clooney and mark wahlberg were very convincing heart out to the lives of those fishermen drama
excellent disaster movie . i am a fishing-lover and have experienced storms , waves unexpected catch (much smaller sharks) etc highly recommended for fishermen fishing-lovers !
amazing movie . loved the fight scene where they wore gold masks
it was outstanding i recomend to anyone  . very realistic great!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
this movie was really good . the scenes felt real i am now afraid to go fishing in ocean it touching at end when eulogy given crew of ship
i just saw it a few hours ago , and thought was brilliant . sure some of the scenes were little iq less  ? sitting on edge my seat for 2/10's movie never sit ! have seen big waves in ocean felt like right there only real problem had sound track.. they could another titanic soundtrack with romance...they blew that...now are no songs can listen to remind me ugh liked am will see video 2-3 more times
might be wolfgang's best movie . clooney and wahlberg were better than they in 3 kings
one of my favorite films . beautiful story , photography performances and music
a truly excellent movie . so unlike all the other jarmusch movies i've seen- it's very truthful , reverent painful real- it actually captures spirit of samurai whitaker is absolutely brilliant see this film
go see it !
an absolutely wonderful movie . the cinematography is great , and so plot urban samurai working for mafia you don't get more creative than that ! acting moments a soundtrack simple but says lot
jim jarmusch is an excellent director , and this movie fit in well with his past productions . the story was original visuals were stunning it definitely enjoyable film score by wutang's rza mood to a tee
great camera angles and a story , but can be little slow at times .
forrest whittaker is a superb actor and does great job in ghost dog . the plot was appealing off wall not your mainstream movie at all
an intense psychological thriller and especially great if you've seen the other movies before it . acting was amazing - anthony hopkins julianne moore were
i was tricked into seeing this movie . had no plans to see it begin with glad did deserved ever oscar received almost as good silence of the lambs
all i can say is that hannibal pure , psycological horror of the first rate ! if were a movie critic would most likely give b+ hopkins moore are excellent together although foster have been much better . scott redeems himself from gladiator with this
this is an epic and at the end you definitly feel like want more . special effects were awsome cinematography was excellent russell crowe did a great job another must see if have not seen it yet
anthony hopkins is as brilliant ever . very nerve-wrecking and scary some people want more action it , but i thought the level was just fine there wasn't any need for think a movie should only have meaningful digress.. great could been tad better it's way myself good everyone atleast try to be an optimist instead of pessimist when rating
my all time favorite .
dumb fun at its most enjoyable , though the stars of film are skydiving and surfing sequences . keanu reeves squeeze isnt up to much
very realistic...similar on a par to the film excalibur . engrossed from beginning end
wicked movie , absolutely exhilerating !
keanu reeves , patrick swayze surfing sky diving and bank robbing - what more could you ask for ? no seriously i'm not sure why this movie is so entertaining but it . lots of great action scenes tied together by a storyline rebelling against authority makes nice little don't expect anything deep (after all the star) point break very just same
let me start off by saying no action thrillers are realistic . i think people up in here criticizing its lack of realism don't see many movies as far action/thriller go , i'd have to say this one was pretty damn and it a good story so will rate movie five because is the very few screenplays that truly impresses characters dynamic much depth especially redford's character i've watched several times now finally begun pick some fascinating provacative details (or themes perhaps) found compelling when thought about how they made an issue out muir having never had meaningful relationship with woman or for matter getting close anyone at all two things he said bishop : 1) put away money you can retire someplace warm touch ever  ; 2) if reservation not come after ended doing both (giving his life savings helping went rogue) makes realize only person world really cared kinda wonder reason redfor's sold girl safety before she came along just worshipped anyway beautiful theme well disguised fast-paced exciting spy thriller random my friends occasionally comment on redford pitt do look related same height build hair eye color general face-structure since seems like picking star
good acting and great plot . the flashback scenes when redford explains his pitt's history are ! all around movie
fortunately , i saw spy game on its premiere night . found it to be the equal of royal tenenbaums in terms entertainment although obviously for different reasons finally a smart semi-apolitical picture from redford anything prevent castle ii !
no one should ever remake this movie . how could they do it better ?
released in and the top grossing film for 1981 , raiders of lost ark remains one most popular films ever produced . few who are uninitiated movie is an action-packed thrill ride which features rough ready archeologist indiana jones (harrison ford) technically a college professor but his real work flying around globe searching artifacts starts out fast with on adventure peru where viewer introduced to fellow nemesis belloq (paul freeman) ends finding ultimate artifact namely covenant as other comments noted tom selleck was originally cast ; however harrison ford played part perfectly human vulnerable not merely action figure going through he has achilles heel snakes realizes that it's age mileage words never sure will get each fix love interest marion ravenswood well karen allen nice mix beauty girl next door looks can actually see her keeping up way blond bombshell could bottom line can't miss refreshed genre so much all subsequent measured thereby
one of my all time favorite movies . the end was part it most realistic scene someone going to heaven i ever saw very emotional and good
i loved this movie . brad pitt and robert redford are excellent in it is most definitely worth going to see at the movies am buy day hits shelves
i thought it was awsome ! brad pitt rob redford are legends in the field . uh.. yeah
really loved this one . great roles for both pacino and williams
awesome movie! ! one of the best i have seen .
great movie ! i saw it in the theater and was a wonderful experience , except for strange guy sitting next to me trying make sip from his icee .  .anyway is tense well-written that keeps you guessing even when know really who killer it's suspenseful raw awesome definitely suggest
the main character ruled them all . he killed like 50 people over a puppy , if thats not awesome i don't know what is his gunfu was strong
to say that equilibrium was under-marketed is an understatement and then some . this film above beyond the best of countless attempts paint a picture nightmarish , fascist future hell it borrows from variety sources but still manages throw all its influences into work truly greater than sum parts prozium modernized version soma aldous huxley's brave new world burning art reminiscent fahrenheit 451 constant fear being reported authorities for feeling taken directly george orwell's 1984 perhaps way describe mix with bladerunner matrix make these elements own making must see besides christian bale man american psycho anyone ?
i think the movie equilibrium is best scifi there after matrix
this was an awesome thriller . captivating all the way to end good job on film
what to say about it it's just excellent
great . this was an amazing movie , that one of my favroites
the film is so great  !
shaft.... ! it took balls for these people to make another shaft movie . richard roundtree did a pretty kewl job on the last one samuel l managed get away with doing splendid after all however pertaining too much violence as has been mentioned in other comments here...the real world of crimals is little else but,.  perhaps this motion picture merely points out just how bad things have really gotten big cities and that's way not approving here or dis-approving....only pointing harsh reality that deal kicked butt...
i think that it was a great movie sammuel jackson always plas his parts to the key.you go bro . vanessa is good in this also ms d
this movie was great . very suspenseful and action packed it well acted casted a must see
most movies from previous decades that are remade horrible . although the idea of him tracking down this guy for two years is a little unbelievable , they did good job keeping basic theme and characters same as original casting samuel l jackson was move
great film . are you not entertained ?
shaft is an excellent movie to see . samuel l jackson plays a great he also looks very cute with bald head will smith was asked play the part , but i am glad got because more serious actor
shaft is outstanding , doing justice to the character in book and original series . hand-over from richard roundtree samuel l was handled very well without getting sappy relying on old man fix everything casting excellent actors played their parts writing a little predictable (especially you killed my brother bit) lot of great one-liners are laid down with precision timing gunplay professionally only couple obvious mistakes (semi-auto handguns don't go click when slide locked back kahr (excellent choice btw) holds 7 rounds mag one chamber...in scene running house pops off 9+ reloading but par they did good job showing him going empty firearm final error i would note that after being shot chest at close range vanessa r not be around like nothing happened...vests impede bullets still get heck punch sternum) an all-around cool movie bad mother : this film ; expect blood violence guns more
this is a cool movie .
it was a great movie!!!!!!! ! makes you think morally and the twist at end is great!! they left open for part 2 . i love mr.farrel!! he's best! mr.sutherland so evil!
this movie is a great choice for someone who wants action . the hand to combat and other fighting scenes are fantastic,a nd plot too russell crowe joaquin phoenix give excellent performances must-see !
what not to love! !
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . didn't know how they were going to pull off a movie where whole thing was in phone booth but it definitely gets two thumbs up
colin farrell -- makes the hwole thing work :d
unlike my predecesors on this post , i know that is the second in series of mariachi movies thus it not as original may seem . do love movie though intense action hunts down man who took away his livelyhood by shooting woman and him through hand so he could no longer play guitar will always be grateful to robert rodriquez for introducing america salma hayek ( loved her here but more frida)
spoiler alert!! ! i absolutely loved the movie . plot was excellent and how "bo" kept killing off paparazzi involved in accident real don't like this , but think they should realize that what do tortures people
i loved it ! and i'm not at all surprised that the entertainment journalists are giving bad reviews ha wink , wink.. .
i loved this movie . the bad guys actually got what they deserved !
totally enjoyed this movie . i thought it didn't get enough recognition great , fun entertainment
this is a great family movie that has everything villians,heroes , and the girl needs rescued . why i gave it 5 was believable imagine any of you finding something like do think could better ?
one of my favorites
this movie contains all the important elements that make an excellent action . while some reviewers are basing their ratings of on historical fact , i am going to stick with fictional side...as didn't go see for reasons went it cause wanted good fighting and followed thru way superb acting around especially so by great joaquin phoenix a very underrated actor who did oscar worthy performance in russell crowe also job as gladiator bloodbath scenes made even better...a must hardcore fans cannot be missed  !
a graet army movie .
great movie for willis . i liked the action in , very exciting excellent plot knew had to see it from trailer
i was really impressed by this movie , and left it feeling like had just been through the experiences of characters in film . got attached to shocking see some them die violent deaths excellent that shows sometimes we can be good guys
such a tragic , yet beautifully told story . it's about nigeria being overtaken by rebels it shows civilians killed and depicts how war really is
exceptional movie . truly an excellent maybe bruce willis' finest
great movie with accurate military depictions . shows the truth that sometimes war is necessary
not as good the temple of doom , but great .
bruce has nailed it right on the head again ! great movie worth going to theatre for . those who don't will probably miss intensity little screen so tough yet vulnerable in this film , got hand him that!!
your famaliar mochismo guy finds a heart action movie . well made special effects don't look corny , tad unrealistic in places but definately worth watching the theatre or on dvd
this movie was great ! it very realistic and touching .
anthony hopkins gave a superb performance in this thriller . there aren't too many movies where you see how deeply disturbed serial killers can be the fact that killer was attempting to end his sinister ways also made film unique
i walked out of the theater shaking . haven't seen a movie this intense since.. well , don't know if i've ever another there are some scenes with so much hellfire and brimstone insanity emily watson was wonderful saw when d.c sniper still lurking about (though in no personal danger it scary for all us) dragon deals same idea perhaps : seemingly-random killer bit an unhealthy disposition but wow what to see anthony hopkins is spectacular- his role similar that silence lambs  good flick- especially seeing
another brilliant sub flick , this one revolving around the historical account of recovery an enigma machine from a u-boat . while not totally faithful to history film still captures feeling being caught deep underwater in steel tube with several tons high explosive going off you :)
awesome movie . rarely does a holywood releases something noteworthy
this is one of the coolest sub movies i have ever seen .
an awsome story along with amazing acting a must see .
i loved this movie becaue it is non-stop action . the very well acted and special effects are awesome
a great movie . the fact that it's based on true story makes it more interesting reveals horror and action navy went through in their battle against dangerous nazis
i watched this movie late at night , so was tired . the beginning kind of slow and almost fell asleep but towards middle good action scenes kick in combined with great technical effects story is heart-breaking
u-571 was a remake of the old movie called das boot and you get very involved in plot . there were parts where everyone held their breath then all heard about 110 people saying oh my god , that close ! it's fairly low tech with no real special effects but it is not needed i also thought interesting because based on true facts from world war
this movie was really good . i felt like in the it well made and acting oustanding
the movie was action packed . i loved all subs blowing up also believe war a true story , and plot wonderful wish longer
perhaps i could be called bias for saying really enjoyed this movie . take classical studies at school and find the ancient greeks romans incredible although there were considerable exaggerations of size some buildings actual attire worn by emperor's sister.....this was a good film 'm glad it won an oscar.....russell crowe did amazing job...i couldn't imagine anyone else playing that role agree with wiggum.....this definately passes bahtroom test !
great movie if you like wwii and the navy's involvement in this war . action-packed...same theme as hunt for red october
this is the best , most suspensful movie i can remember seeing . it was interesting and had me on edge of my seat there were some really cute actors too am planning in theater again
maximus and his roman tattoo . did you see that ?
keeps you on the edge of your chair
oh yeah ! this is what i call fighting . no cables who-hooo! and jet li so cool he one of my top 3 actors the fight-scenes in even surpassed matrix. it's true
poopy
very entertaining and good action . jet li rules
wow this movie was absolutly phonominal . the cinimatography great and it made me feel as if i back in time of romans had a plot that could follow whole way through end amazing is fantastic have seen so many times
great movie . loved the directing very good performances by busta rhymes , ray liotta jason patrick and chi mcbride film is about character who on leave because he shoots a pregnant woman accident actually called in to investigate murder of cop works side with him get clues monitor investigation that so many levels
i wanted to murder dern's character in this movie he was such a bastard ! could really feel the intensity . great
thought this was a great thriller . it's about 2 orphaned teens forced to live with rich couple , but they're not what they seem be script well done and so the acting it has lot of suspense surprises leelee sobieski starred as oldest child did an excellent job also in diane lane bruce dern
it is a good thriller....very well done .
i loved it . ladder 49 is a great movie about the firefighters life i'm vol firefighter/emt and geuss close to movies like this will add my collection of dvds
this was definitely one of the best movies i've seen in a long time . just flew by i can't wait to see it again and will buy dvd as soon comes out
entertaining , witty fast paced great acting directing brilliant stuff . shall i say more ?
i was as impressed with this movie hoping to be . we don't have enough movies substance anymore , it's all about who can swear the most or get loving blow up a film that no trouble letting kids watch
epic . great story viggo mortenson and omar sharif are fantastic go see it
based on john grisham's popular novel , the client largely delivers as a suspenseful thriller . plot revolves around young mark sway (brad renfro) who witnesses suicide of big time mafia lawyer however before commits he confides in and tells him location body missing louisiana senator what follows is thrilling ride seeks to silence while ambitious district attorney roy foltrigg attempts find out boy knows meanwhile help an inexperienced reggie love (susan sarandon) film quick with very few slow moments between solid performances by all involved especially renfro puts over top crime drama/thriller overall highly recommended
one of the best movies that i've seen in a long time . to truly understand this movie you need pay attention other words : if have a.d.d than don't bother with because you'll find yourself asking lot questions but enjoy good action/adventure epic many scenes graphic violence then is for please do not confuse braveheart , only idiots like make generalizations would ever get two confused
this movie was very entertaining to watch , so much that i went see it 3 times and the jet scene with l a missle one of best scenes .
johnny depp , .. . aaaaaaaa hes so great - at everything !
johnny depp steals the show . again he also wrote his own character's ominous , sexy theme music !
great film . certainly , a bit of manipulation historical fact was involved but this is not history gladiator the opening battle sequence excellent...although i did wonder why chanting german warriors sounded exactly like zulu's from 1960s same name russel crow good as war weary roman hero think joaquin phoenix better commodus it gratifying to see that mighty sven thorssen got part ! derek jacobi's cameo role also very costumes armour fight choreography were all brilliant
like i've been saying since i saw it , this is the second best movie seen all year -- teetering on being first . funny from start to finish and literally had goosebumps at how cool (action-wise) was great buddy action-comedy dare say beat rush hour genre helped create make popular ? really hope one helps launch rock's career as an action star people take him seriously because of role he did a superb job yet laugh can't believe when if they haven't
this was an awesome movie , glad i saw it .
i recently rented the movie 'proof of life' just to see russell crowe in another confirm that he is one best actors have seen a long time .
great acting by russell crowe ! action scenes , battles and fights costumes locations this movie rocks
terribly underrated judging from its ranking on this list . malice was a great thriller that included top actors at their very best baldwin and kidman were especially good in roles , as pullman the plot is solid film presents suspenseful aura keeps hold of viewer's attention throughout has few twists turns here there high quality cast highly recommended to all
very , rewatchable movie . lost track of how many times i've watched this film although not my favorite all time i still like alot the opening was powerful(especially for military minded type people myself) in about ten minutes viewer gets a pretty good idea why roman empire empire.(unleash hell luv that line and straight forward way it delivered as matter fact) so expected more ,however ,as everyone knows story arced different direction(for better) but damn what an opinion joaquin phoenix nailed commodus character perfectly really stole show preformance wise r.i.p richard harris great
it's hard not to think of russell crowe's holier than thou attitude but he really shined in this movie . it almost rates up there with ben hur as a period flick that chariot race can never be beat
best bond movie in years .
pierce bronsan rocks ! he is a great james bond and this movie (storyline) intense . the 'toys' are awesome (speedboat) woman (as always) well cast with funny play on words (chritmas jones)
the best of all bondies . brings back fun and intriguing elements old , adds great modern special effects no 'bond girl' models can't act but they never could in these movies nor were intended to need it works this way well hear hear! ! let's have some more
this is my favorite movie of all time . it stars mel gibson and julia roberts , 2 the top in history both possibly their best roles ever fabulous a conspiracy nut who gets bit to close truth d.a that little patrick stewart also superb as evil psychiatrist  definitely must see rated r but easily could have passed for pg considering there no sexuality minor profanity (approx 25 profane words ) mid amounts violence non gory however i would recommend anyone
now this is such an adreline-pumping movie ! it has some wonderful action sequences , great fights and the motorcycle chase scene incredible yes dialouge isn't that good but that's not what about . its intense energy excitement really delivers john woo did a very job directing film i reccommend you see
outstanding performances from crowe and phoenix(who should have won best supporting actor) assist this already wonderful story magnificiantly filmed masterpiece . a good old fashioned tale of justice being served , with twist course if you somehow managed to not see movie i strongly suggest that following obvious repeated smacks the forehead deserve purchase
the movie was really action packed . tom cruise a good actor special effects were cool plot ending great
i liked the girl . lots of action good graphics and stunts cars
amazing action slow motion shots .
gladiator deserves 5 stars . i love the fighting scenes , plot and actors russell crowe was great but actor that impress me joaquin phoenix he an excellent villain killed his father tried to sleep with sister taunt maximus am disappointed did not win a best supporting for this movie
i'm only 16 , but for most of my life the plane and chase scenes were favorite in all cinema .
you have to watch this movie . some may say its historically incorrect or completely unrealistic but the truth is that unless you're a cynical professional critic you'll love it
the coolest movie this summer . tom cruise was very cool beginning of awesome motorbike chase again i'd like to see it because is worth another watch
this was an action packed movie . i enjoyed it much better than the first mission impossible how they had a love story involved in
i loved it ! the action was impressive , though plot simple . much more entertaining than first one
mi2 had very good music and i feel compelled to go buy the soundtrack if it weren't for free songs available on napster .
i watched the mission impossible before , so maybe this is reason keep track of it . catches your focus from very beginning also feel title created has a good advertisement effect already
i loved the fact that tom cruise did all his own stunts . knowing makes it a lot more entertaining
very entertaining and not difficult to follow . it is more exciting than mi one the motorcycle scene was same as in top gun i thought soundtrack be haunting shots from australia made me want go there
i gave this movie a five because the graphics were so cool . part when he was climbing on mountain in beginning looked real martial art moves that tom cruise does is amazing
buena pelicula que nos retorna a las antiguas peliculas legendarias como ben hur , espartaco cleopatra claro con el toque de la nueva tecnologia recrea ambientes esa epoca . epopeya dramatiza rusell crowe es un reflejo se puede hacer buen cine argumentos historicos
kung fu and werewolves ? what's not to like
first off , watch the french version with english subtitles (if you need them) . it's much better and tends to make story easier follow second beautiful just.. wow costumes scenery choreography everything score is stunning now yes it glaringly historically inaccurate but i don't think was one of their priorities let alone something they had in mind any case after all said done still a great movie worth watching just see fronsac frenzy at brotherhood's hideout also for final fight scene jean-francois his sword bone sword/grappling hook/chain thing end action
aaliyah really was stunning in this role . it's too bad she's not around anymore her and jet-li make a faboulous pair
i personally loved this movie . it is incredibly underrated outstanding performance by jet li aaliyah also was good in awesome action and should belong on the top 20 of any list
this movie was great . the mri-mode in combat scenes is a little freaky , but i liked it characters where likable/hate-able appropriately and kept moving story line even interesting...and it's an action flick !
a little better than braveheart . and since gladiator was fiction at least you didn't know what the ending
excellent special effects . i like the story , but didn't understand why they named movie romeo must die
romeo must die was a really good movie . i saw it twice because had lot of action sequences , so for guys and also love interest develop which satisfied the girls
romeo must die has comedy , love and action all in one . i like the actors really enjoyed fight scene virtual look was cool
the first movie made in u.s . with jet li excitement of li's movies combined real life experience modern oakland makes this great special effects are some that both exciting and gruesome russell wong fight scene is perhaps one best any i ever watched
i think this is the best movie i've seen in a long time . one thing that bothered me was how they spoke mandarin hong kong being chinese , know kong's main language cantonese other than liked everything about it especially fighting scene between jet li and russel wong also were able to add special effects when illustrationg point at where enemy dies their bones break
long years ago , charlton heston starred in ben hur...and those days the cinematography was surprisingly well done . gladiator came along...and really surprised me russel crowe did a magnificent job his portrayl of such brave fighter he managed to fill role this movie with more credibility than one could imagine caeser as disgusting...heartless...back stabbing and once again...credible times world's history....especially rome's producers recreated it all so beautifully realisitically an intense but impressive film
see the new bruce lee in movies ! awesome action-packed movie with great fighting scenes . must if you like
i am an action movie freak . this was packed with on the edge of my seat all time fell in love jet li , who also lethal weapon 4 he's a great martial artist aaliyah superub for her first acting gig everything about from storyline to dialogue
this movie is excellent!! ! i saw recently..and must say mi eyes were glued to the screen...russell crowe was amazing...i am a big fan of him and he great actor russ played role maximuss..the character fearless brave strong daring had really good heart! joaquinn phoenix ceaser...the greety , sneeky mean disgusting everything ceaser shouldnt be!...he always seems play bad guy roles...he in yards w/ star mark wahlberg....and russ...he plays roles very well..the best action sequence yr . (according mtv awards) all voters(includin myself) who said it was!! oh dont forget awards won for it...well story's plot original...it about soldier (russ) fighter caeser wanted ta go home his family...the original father joaquin played....newayz...he told maximus that take place after dies b/c says son would not do job it..and wen son(joaquin phoenix) found out petrified so murdured could be ruler maximus..so became slave sold some rich fight..in other words gladiator! 4 fight stronger men killed hav peeps scream yell at them...but they didnt know maximus....he best...he every1 tried kill him...he winner! as u know...the ending perfect...it worked out...hehe...hope give too much away wo havebt seen it..i just tell lil can understand ya c  : ) extrordinary reccomend everyone hasnt yet!!
very freaky !
this picture makes you realize that there are secret societies going on in college . very good movie
i thought this movie was great . think it made a lot of highschool students twice about fraternities or secret societies the very clear , and expressive points were to make audience
i don't usually watch these kind of movies but wow this movie totally kicks @ss . love russell crowe's character maximus he was so fearless , strong and extremely intelligent is an action packed from begining to end the blood guts a definite plus
very touching . this movie gave me chills and made cry
great special effects . a sad movie when you know before the people in film do that they are about be bombed
i thought that pearl harbor was an awesome movie . all of you say it rubbish or whatever...you are just screwed up in the head ok , some people were put off by whole romance situation going on...ya know....romance happening even at a hard time us history too...not fighting think made more personal...you felt connection for characters...it gave something needed to make better than if could have been blah
great movie!! !
great action scenes !
the first hour of this movie i couldnt stand its glamorized romance depiction ( snuggling on rocks overlooking an amazing coastline ) . but throughout became more and interested hooked it had magnificant battling a fantastic ending liked than thought would while watching after ended
i wrote this review on august 11 , one month to the day of terrorist attacks and think it stands even more true today : how quickly we are willing criticize something that did not create a work art belonging another--but isn't human nature ? judge book by it's cover musician single song person his or her physical appearance . didn't do same for pearl harbor public see posters read reviews then spurn epic tale off as another titanic yes was reluctant movie want sit in theater three hours care war but turned out be so much can you say hated when saying makes sound like hate part our history americans inspired such feeling patriotism allegiance me american flag is now than just piece fabric--it symbol what country fought soldiers died cannot believe apathetic unconcerned comes they critic's lemmings form their own opinions film only sat back let take plunge box office sales had beautiful stars leading roles--but ask doesn't story love story--but also wasn't beginning bit slow each character introduced--but if weren't would really got killed during bombing little further into most moving heart-rending have ever seen cried throughout ashamed at myself never realizing those unsuspecting people went through terrible morning almost sixty years ago i'm still could apathy toward america's inaccurate some may don't all historical movies kind inexactitude documentary--rather fictional--film every actor talented beyond belief kate beckinsale cuba gooding jr. josh hartnett jon voight dan aykroyd ben affleck james king tom sizemore alec baldwin thousands extras helped bring life admire them standing tall tried shoot down my touches way changes existence ways always notice right away change entire outlook making us sensitive changing goals convictions these life-changing films--it made better numerous intensity awareness realization god bless cast jerry bruckheimer michael bay humble finally showing with glitz computer imagery should forever proud
pearl harbor is a wonderfuly diveloped movie . it isn't very historicly correct true the raid was kind of but everything else wasn't i must say nice - computer animation wise there lots gore and arizona sceens looked real totaly reccommend watching
when i first heard about pearl harbor , saw it was around my birthday so decided to check out . went on the internet and all these critics were trashing couldn't believe then see movie better than ever ! almost star wars everyone in did an excellent job this is for
i cannot understand why people are so hard on pearl harbor . thought it was a great movie , awesome!!!! ! sat in the theater looking at screen awwww!!!!!! japanese attack scene both realistic and terrifying acting decent.ben affleck josh hartnett gave good performances jon voight fdr ,and alec baldwin too as jimmy doolittle kate beckingsale hot!!!! i'm buying this dvd whenit is released may complain about love story but that what had most of them watching titanic thousand damn times guy
just look at the amount of oscars it got . kiss my @$$ traffic !
i have recently seen pearl harbour and enjoyed the whole movie.the attack on was thought out very well by japanese.a day never to be forgotten .
great inspiring movie . could have done with less battle scenes in the begining ,but thats a women thing. russell crowe was magnificent fire and fury that leaped from screen
hey kids ! wondering what it was like to live in the us during early 1980's ? well , nothing provides a better dose of reagan-esque kill-a-commie-for-mommy right-wing gun nut paranoid propaganda than watching this movie on lazy afternoon .
chalk this one up to my sentimental favorites . i love movie swayze and jennifer grey did years before dirty dancing it also had c thomas howell several others young stars of the day kids from michigan fighting soviet invaders using whatever weapons they could russle a truly inspiring should hope will give everyone courage stand fight if an actual invasion us ever happens as in
brilliant acting . of course i may be biased , since i'm an aussie but thought that russell crowe was in his role joaquin phoenix would have to the best bad-guy i've ever seen portrayed a movie - he makes you feel sorry for him and understand how feels actors with smaller parts were often played by well-renowned and/or this film isn't historically correct it gives unimaginable insight into grandeur glory rome every detail from plot digital effects action costume can't rave enough about see it!! !
more realistic than most people want to admit . the green party seizes power in germant and kicks out us army a revolution mexico this leads soviet led invasion of united states soviets would not nuke usa because they desperatly need our fertile farm-land won't it's own two pronged with troops coming up through down though canada brings conventional war mainland america ragtag group young kids small town , heartland see their idyllic little world turned upsidedown by decide kick some commie butt is plot behind strangly compelling moving movie while it does feature best acting litle over top its patriotism still fun watch unlike other movies where good guys come save day outcome final resolution mild sort way unexpected one patrick swayze's first freedom fighters are course disparate you have jocks nerds smart ones chicks like breakfast club on steroids fairly passable flick ignatious j reilly says check
russell crowe did a very nice job . the movie had an original plot , and i definetly wouldn't mind seing it again
this is a movie on crack.....but it's hilarious . forget about judging plot and acting mereit pointless what's makes so great to watch the action , jokes vulgarity has be most vulgar in existance i have never heard word f^$* used many times move (it's definitely 200s) thing hear how much every character cusses you'll stop laughing some of actions scenes are bit ludicrs gory as well (meatloaf's body blows up walls room turn all red) if you want enjoy yourself get really good laugh your money's worth with formula 51
lethal weapon 3 was in my opinion the best of four films . i have to admire filmmakers , who integrated drama with action quite effectively film glover and gibson are solid as usual their on-screen chemistry is still strong pesci provides some comic relief along way rene russo a fine addition series glover's character somewhat disengaged after he discovers that shot one his son's friends drug bust take over such amazing (and amusing) on screen overall fantastic bringing us exciting dramatic comedic moments all within two hours
i think this was the best in serise only time that one of recs's girlfriends didnt die
one heck of a movie . the 'sequel' to fugitive is better than its predecessor it stars  , once again tommy lee jones as foul mooded u.s marshall this time chasing wesley snipes action first with some great chase scenes definite thriller for those in word caution - probly not kids their plenty profanity and gory violence
gladiator kicks ass (and so does russel crowe , who is gorgeous)
the first pierce brosnan james bond film i saw was die another day  . it actually in a theater since 1970's took my 10-year-old son to see his , and he totally loved ! is absolutely great role definitely closest thing sean connery entire series are same age which makes me little biased but did not know this when tomorrow never dies second of brosnan's that excellent just as excited any movies roger moore allright have physical presence however do like different approach portrayal certainly miss aura until reappeared say again 1983 welcome sight only didn't aboug movie absence original opening logo music other than an remember own father drive-in 1962 dr.no two things remembered from were ursula andress rising sea bikini scene dr no's unsuccesful attempts grab onto pipes with steel hands drowned at end those memories stayed all these years truly grown up films will always love them consider one most enjoyable parts life
such a great historical movie . i think one of best in movie's history
i loved the scenes in movie . teri hatcher made a very hot bond girl this was one of my favorite films
i love the action and all cool gadgets . like james bond movies very exciting thrilling with sexy girls
i really enjoyed watching this movie because it was non-stop action . there not a moment in the that bored another reason why is like interesting cars and gadgets 007 has
this movie is great . they mix honor , heroism action drama and suspense together get a full dose of what known gladiator it also gives you good look at how fast someone back then can be so bad defy emporer that day when could become more powerful than he rome some them came for pride glory revenge uses quotes man once told me death smiles us all the only thing we do smile crowe
great movie full of beautiful cars (minus the civic's which are crap) . anyone who says otherwise doesn't know all that much about (btw , v8's heavier than v4's so even because they do have more power weigh down car is why a v6 best to but v4 definately better choice v8 one can get from couple nos tanks) i love racing and this representation it (and another comment races very rarely only quarter mile if were case would last 10-15 seconds people claim first race in was supposed be then obviously don't what 10 second is- 1st 1/4 or less.)
great acting , story affects all round movie . and the gore well that just makes it seem real i mean if you're head was cut off you'd expect a little blood wouldn't you ?
i think the movie was really good hot guys and cars , what more do you need ?
im not a car guy , and thought i was going to like this movie . it surprised me lot though its action is goo entertaining throughout the whole film much better than gone in 60 seconds
i was really looking forward to seeing this movie and my expectations were unmistakingly rewarded . although would have liked seen more races , what lacked in action made up for cars wow saw some amazing machines esspecially the one that paul walker's character drives (the bright green beauty) is eventually destroyed by a very convincing enemy johnny plot little slow ending not hoped but again vin diesel don't believe director could chosen better king of road i'm sequel
really good movie , vin diesel is a babe....the cars were on fire and the races even better....so much better than real life
this movie is kick ass ! it has everything . a great story , directing acting action dialogue its wonderfully made epic definately one of the best movies 2000
this movie was a well done and the cars were very nice to look at .
i know the movie isnt great art , but liked it a lot . maybe thats cause cars street racing has been part of most my life used were awsome friends people talk to about say sucked im sure other would agree its one favorite movies was exciting loved scenes also paul walker vin deisel are two actors they hott! ! think really good!
well 1st off....this movie was excellent! ! i am really into movies and can pretty much tell which 1s are g00d so w/ that info telling ya this is a must c the actors were very casted..there paul walker(wat fox) big muscular dude who goin ta be in anotha soon(i think called knockout boys) newayz..sori cant remeber his naem but he good it..they basically stars of it  : ) about undercover cop(paul walker) tryin to figure out people stealing from supply trucks...and leads on there..hehe...and has like hottest cars bad ass speed...to race..and if ur inta 4 u...its action packed...ok guess thats all..to give some it....just go urself...(its great)
it was awesome . this movie fabulos a real work of art just great had action and drama the kept you interested in for whole time my mind movies is best ever !
i thought it was an excellant movie... . great... would watch again.. great action movie....funny in some parts too hehehe
the best horror film in years !
were it not for the collapse of iron curtain , this true story would still be just a footnote single report lost in russian navy's archives whose existance was officially denied . now that story's out what better way to share then with film scope we can all salute bravery officers and men k-19 half them posthumously
a very good historic movie about one of the biggest submarines in soviet army sixties
a very good movie the plot was great .
high crimes sends the viewer on a rollercoaster of emotions , from sadness to fear shock alarm movie is never ever boring ! ashley judd and morgan freeman are stellar (as always) jim caviezel gives powerful convincing performance .
best van damme movie but i liked it because im a fan of bolo yeung .
i'm rating this from the perspective of when i first watched it--as an 8 year-old boy . loved it then , but it's virtually unwatchable today
a masterful narrative that provides clearer historical understanding of the establishment ch'ing dynasty movie 'hero' attempted to make entertaining , lesser cinematographic success .
sean connery plays a desert bandit who kidnaps an american widow and her two kids . it is 1904 brian keith great teddy roosevelt sends the marines they land shoot up ruler's palace , hold him for ransom get back americans loosely based on history but really fun in main scenes between candace bergen connerty sometimes little draggy you can fast forward past those
the opening scene make whole move worth it...on a par with first ten minutes of saving private ryan for stark realism and violence . remainder holds lup very well....would pay to see it twice thats something i never do....enjoy
this probably one of those movies that people either love or completely hate . if you don't get it , you'll and say still then may understand intellectually everything about the film but true understanding kind thing is visceral feel bad i'm not criticizing anyone who doesn't i totally admit for everyone terence malick (badlands) has got best eyes nature i've ever encountered setting movie (guadalcanal believe) like heaven on earth into which descends very worst humanity invented (war) scenery most beautiful seen in a wasn't cgi'd so retains realism soul serves as yet another character ridiculously impressive cast was glad expecting typical war because can see how would be disappointed ; wwii just find beauty even ugliness are able to look with right
i believe this film has got bad ratings due to the fact it is a war picture - hence most people expect action , and cheap melodramatic moments i.e . every soldier bites dust during course of except main star(hmm saving private ryan) so much more first have seen from malick must say he an outstanding visionary maginficently shot with its long sweeping shots panoramic views certain stillness beautiful calmness cinematography which complements somewhat philosophical nature do not fast cutting speeded camera mtv generation clearly put his heart soul into (his for 20 years) craft profound unforgettable dreamlike piece poetic art those who yearn something little different intelligence will find that resonates sense euphoria through mind
i don't know how people can act so negatively toward this work of art . it's one the most beautifully photographed films have ever seen , which is typical terrence malick understand that it hard to follow but lots poetry there isn't a lot action sure depth in characters
had to go back for more ! the battle scenes were terrific , acting...!! i laughed cried and cringed throughout it's comparable braveheart although could never watch that movie twice
this movie was awesome !! ! go carman we need more christain movies that are like . unfortunately i see alot or corny out there is far from them but so it's no surprize just a thought
very inspiring and suspenseful . love carman !
an excellent action movie . carman , the champion did a fantastic job tbn should make more movies like this
great movie , american media should make more like it .
a wonderful story of faith and perserverance . great action romance family movie with good role model
by far the greatest no-nonsense action movie ever created . i saw this summer before my first-grade year--i have been fascinated with archaeology since (i even studied it in college) looks as good 22 years later half movies filmed today
lethal weapon 4 brings a satisfying close to an action series that i consider be one of the best . like its predacessor , dealt with real-life issue (the chinese oppression and immigration corruption) it made for solid story there were some great scenes comedy biggest props have go joe pesci chris rock who had such surprisingly good comedic chemistry on screen together glover gibson russo are as always jet li is main villian overall fine addition (and ending) this explosive
great performance by bullock , it showed once again her versatile talent
probably the most intelligent flick out this summer . some funny lines , an old fashioned grown up version of lethal weapon
well , i loved the movie ! we started watching it in history and thought wouldnt like but then got into had to rent myself finish . cried @ end :( really think that was very good *'* guy is hot!!!!!
when this movie first came out , i saw the ad for it and thought really looks stupid . gave a chance watched time about year ago is pretty good full of action sci fi very well done
erika christensen does a real convinving job in this movie like classictvfan and rodeodo say . she is wonderful actress who could make playing tossed salad interesting
having just recently seen this movie , i must say that was quite impressed . it's one of the most suspenseful thrillers i've in a long time and along with seven is probably tied for best cat mouse film 1990s morgan freeman as always completely convicing manages to pull off playing role an almost unrealistically brilliant detective well at few points actually asking myself how hell did guy figure out? despite still plays part supported by great cast including ashley judd jay o'sanders cary elwes who good overall minus holes plot kiss girls thriller rivals provocative its decade it keeps hold on viewer's attention all way through climaxes explosive surprising ending
wow ! just goes to show how diverse keanu's acting ability is . he's got be the hottest serial killer ever two thumbs up
this is the best ( and really for me , only) that belushi has ever done very well . everything about movie made sense connected they also didn't add a deep love story which was good
chris rock and anthony hopikins were great together
i like this movie a lot good plot and dmx did some acton .
if you want mindless , moronic action this is the film for . (girls don't bother clicking no button i just helped out.) jet li shows off his considerable fighting skills against only worthy opponent they could find him : ! thank god role didn't go to rock as it was supposed great one fine and everything but doubt he has pinache all of smacketh laying downeth ability properly club a guy with motorcycle very solid fx sort 'terminator' feel final fight alone worth buying flick about most people will hate take movies too seriously these days (thanks quentin.) expect plot however best script li's gotten right lines there'd be stopping i'm nobody's bitch good first step though nice poetic justice at end resolving things into heaven hell
as corney all the rambo movies are , they fun to watch . yes i agree complete bulls**t but still cool even if you think it sucked a movie were entertained good set of flicks
this movie was good because of the realness it gave . watching almost brought tears to my eyes showed depth revenge
best action movie of the summer . vin diesel is awesome in this and stunts were incredible
the best action/love story movie of year . it was an excellent , well written i loved braveheart and this similar
kicked ass! !
this movie is one of the best action movies all time . it has so much feeling and at same
wow , am i glad to see this movie so high on the publics list . love and every in trilogy also pleased that dvd for all three movies is coming out november a great fictional has power excite peopl of ages reccomend everyone everywhere if you havent seen it have watch again
gladiator is a very cool look at the roman times . coliseum was well done , and i impressed nero character an excellent villain also liked how beginning of movie tied into ending
i think this was a great movie because there tons of action . not one part boring if you miss something , then have no clue why they're fighting
this movie is one of the best movies i've ever seen . it's hella dramatic
just saw 3,000 miles to gracland ! excellent movie . don't listen the critics , it's a bunch of bull
the movie was definitely a great . i'm type of person that wouldn't like films these , but it taught you lot about honor and being true it's good to have medieval time period movies from
charlie's angels 2 is a great movie . it's perfect for everybody it has little bit of everything- action , romance suspense drama comedy (cameron diaz hilarious!) and lots skin the guys go see
rocks
excellent film , enjoyed the action and special effects . i also screen play between actors
this one is funny as hell .
this is michael mann at his best . everyone talks about silence of the lambs as movie from thomas harris novels , but one right there with it my all-time favorite action scenes end when peterson's character jumps through a pane glass to rescue woman killer timed in such way that crashing coincides reemergence guitar and drums long dormant period iron butterfly's inna-godda-da-vida
gene le bell sucks . this movie is coooooooooooooooooooolllllllllllll
gladiator is a great movie . it probably one of the best action fighting movies ever made
the best action movie of all time . far better than most movies
a terrific movie for ridley scott . perhaps one of the greatest and most terrible periods human history is depicted here you can feel yourself marching with legions , armor shining in sun half millenia they ruled greater part earth republic that became an empire general slave saved classic story pulled from civilization all time must see everyone
it was great!i really had doubts going in to watch this movie because of the fact that paul walker only main character from first returning.but i must admit,he actually managed carry film (with alot help co-star tyrese) beyond original blockbuster.i never thought they could make a good sequel without vin diesel,but wrong.truth is,vin should have starred than lame xxx which just big letdown.i also director,john singleton,did great job......however,if theres one thing let down there two real street race scenes movie,otherwise its flawless
greatest movie i've seen this year . top notch acting skills great effects and background scenes brought tears to my eyes anger blood a true hero tragedy
an absolute must see movie ! the glory of cinema
this has got to be one of the greatest action war movies since braveheart . it had almost every emotion involved in movie
excellent special effects ! i can't wait for part iii
wonderful movie , despite the gore . b g (blood guts) seem to be an integral part of films now and i think it heightens realism crowe phoenix reed nielsen harris did a fabulous job in this recommend anyone who has stomach for innate way better than patriot (sorry melfans...)
great thrilling movie
russell crowe took on a different role playing gladiator in the roman empire . movie has been compared to othes like braveheart and patriot it stands alone among all
for those who love to relive the fantasies and experience heroic deeds , this is a must .
a disney classic .
nicest disney movie i've ever seen.it touch my heart .
good movie though historically inacurate . while commodus was marcus aerulius' son , he did not die in the arena strangled by political opponents regardless gladiator had a strong storyline villan and great action sequences this is making
this film is amazing and should be the top movie of all time . you can never get bored it brings a smile to your face every it's one those magical things that captures won't let go most memorable
when i first saw the movie fell in love with it . timone and pumba now that my 2 year old son has seen all 3 he had to have a stuff simba watchs movies day this is great for whole family
this movie is amazing with the animals animation and music all good there romance  . laughter you need to watch over just catch it especially comedy stand inns hyenas a perfect hilarious film also has death problems that actually happen up its
it is a film that captuers the hole family . i found amazing to watch and have watched countless times will never get bored of lion king ! this movie hilarious , see you'll be hooked
i liked this movie had cool song and plus love animals...i wanna see the japanesse one lol
one of the best children's movies all time . a certifiable classic disney should be proud problem is they stole this movie from japanese release years earlier
a very good movie . and the music is even better i knew it was just matter of time until they were doing musical elton john did fantastic job this timeless
what really bugs me are people (especially christians!) who put down hollywood movies and other entertainment as being morally wrong aand violent , yet hold disney up a moral guidepost for the rest of industry . here we have movie about one jelous brother killing his sibling chasing away competition eventually comes back extracts revenge sweet feel good isn't it ?
this is the surprise summer hit . i saw movie two times and i'm gonna' get it on dvd made russell crowe my favorite actor
my favorite movie as a child . i loved the songs
best . disney movie ever
it is one of disney's most meaningful animated films . the writing , storyline was excellent music spectacular plays so much background throughout movie message for its viewers great ; characters blend in well with plot it's a good adults and kids
i love this.. . think it's really my favorite disney movie and don't like a lot of the modern movies.. course , this was done at least five or six years ago wasn't it ? music
i , as an older kid don't like this movie much,but used to love it . keep in mind people that was made for small younger children is great a family with
this movie is probably the best one i have seen for year of 2000 so far . battle scenes were outstanding character , maximus was a bad ass it like love story and an action all in good direction
i truly can t say anything bad about this movie . its simply wonderful period definitely my favorite disney anyone who bashes has either 1- never seen it , or 2- no taste whatsoever a++
great movie ! its teaches kids so many different lessons in life . it is the best disney animated i've ever seen- better than beauty and beast , cinderella has songs that characters sing i actually enjoy listening to them most movies have those hurt my ears...but love lion king also encourage you see play- on broadway beautiful was worth every penny
the lion king is an all-around classic that i fully plan on showing my children , and hopefully 100 years from now will still be appreciated for what it : a great movie family . rarely have seen walt disney produce film such as this- watch every then even at age of 15 just never seems to bore me espescially with hilarious antics tummone pumba concur castlebee jeremy irons played voice scar perfectly- perfect villian ! this so dramatic actually used cry when mufasa died mixture drama comedy romance music
the lion king was a brilliant children's film with an impeccable adaption of shakespearean tragedy .
the lion king is my favorite animated disney film . it has great storylines , good writing music powerful messages for its viewers characters blend well with plot i like fact that covers life cycle really : antelopes eat grass are eaten by lions when perish they before which wow a breath of fresh air this movie truly classic generation to come may never be forgotten !
omg this movie is awesome , but bambi defintatley better . for those who haven't seen see it didn't cry when they saw watch again you cold hearted sob !
i luv tis friggin movie! ! the songs and everything!'!
one of the best ever . perfectly cast , awesome music and puts most other action/adventure movies to shame
one of the only good action movies that came out . full was non-stop throughout movie lots killing and gore in all
wow ! beautifiul . fun for the whole family climactic , brilliant amazing my favorite childs film a real beaut an absolute must-see i could go on hours about how absolutely marvellous this is but won't bother probably could've done without stupid fart-jokes it's still beautiful sad entertaining see it now summary : inspired that has hardly any flaws
this is one movie my whole family enjoyed even the not so young ones . we own it on vhs , dvd and have a cassette that practically listen to every time go somewhere with car never gets boring
well before i donned my first pair of mouse club ears , considered myself a life-long fan empire disney . that sincere devotion included everything from disneyland to mickey watch yet for very long span years had all but given up on ever being truly entertained by one their feature length cartoons while felt the creative geniuses never really lost edge or ability produce high quality state art animated films awhile was they - form without substance then came lion king and completely re-evaluate position know there were some critically acclaimed preceding this few not since days death walt (1966) seen it come together in such winning combination beautiful music classic compelling story drama humor selection voices animal characters also excellent jeremy irons particular standout as embittered evil scar still crack when think his droll delivery line you have nooo idea ! least surprised heard been turned into successful live musical is an addition either adult children's video collection
this is a very good disney film and one of my favorite movies made . simba's father died he thought it was his fault so ran away the area gets taken over simba makes friends with timon pumba when grows up , finds ot being must go back save
a great movie for kids and adults . characters , songs storyline an unforgettable story
this movie appeals to all ages . when i was in college , my group of guy friends always watched the lion king it on went over there is a great story
wonderful ! a movie that adults enjoy , too
the second best animation ever made definetly disney ! :o)
i personally think this movie is the best ever and a total masterpiece . sequal probably second
very good release from pixar/disney .
good action , a lot of blood . story
not just a kids movie . there are lot of jokes in it that many might understand
by far , one of the best animated movies ever made . characters are warm loveable and memorable story is heart-warming has a lot cute slapstick-type comedy to make it enjoyable for young children but deep enough touch an adult's heart i was in my very early teens when first saw now at age 20 it's just as close then
great kids movie ! hell , adult i loved it
another one of the best walt disney animation movies it was so cool how they made toys come to life and just awesome
one of the best childrens films i've ever seen . my grandfather usually falls asleep in childs , but me grandad and nephew went to see it he didn't fall even commented on how good was still is now do not miss they've made a toy story 2 which just as enchanting wonderful summary :
very good original story done all with computers . i just loved this movie about toys that come to life when the humans are not around woody is a toy cowboy who devoted his kid andy andy's favorite until buzz lightyear comes and now feels he has lost wants get rid of only backfires both end up at sids boy loves destroy they must work together away from sid back will be moving away.this family ages can enjoy we found it funny entertaining there some actors providing voices such as tom hanks tim allen
thi is a great film . wooy , toy cowboy was andy's favorite at first then he gets buzz lightyear space ranger and soon woody worried that might be forgotten tries to find way get rid of him ends up sid's house sid destroys toys become friends
fantastic computer graphics and storyline . tom hanks always seems to be at his best when it comes children films the actors voices are brilliant characters lovable i love this film so much that my partner bought me ts1 2 on dvd for christmas !
this movie was great . offered a lot of new and cool aspects animation imagination much better than i had expected story for anyone
i think toy story was really well done and silly . when went to see the sequel in theater , there wasn't one little kid audience nope it all teenagers !
toy story brought to life a child's imagination . the computer animation was entirely realistic down last shadow 2 even better than this one
toy story was a creative masterpiece . it is true achievement when adults and children can see movie enjoy equally tom hanks tim allen were wonderful providing the voices for main characters also good to many of toys my youth (i.e mr potato head) come life on screen if you have or don't kids , check this out funny touching won't be disappointed
my favorite movie of the summer . it was very realistic because they used real characters , settings (rome) and clothing (armor weapons) this made girlfriend cry if you like action with out guns tops off storyline well written acting good
the best of disney . i have watched many times first to take my own children now granddaughter loves belle must see it was a very entertaining movie
disney's masterpiece , with voice actors paige o'hara and robbie benson you got to love this film
one of the best disney movies ever . great story , characters and even some songs this movie was first animated to be nomimated for picture highly recommended
one of my favorite disney movies all time
what a terrific disney movie . if i were to rate my favorite recent animated full length it would be this one.very well done , good songs funny and romantic saw at the theater with kids enjoyed every bit of characters fun watch.the talking clocks other objects loved when belle beast found they cared for one another.this has some best our guest rest no wonder turned into broadway play
this movie had plenty of action . there were some occasional slow moments in the film , but it was all made up for with that took place russel crowe a near perfect fit maximus (good acting)
by far one of the best disney movies there is . i've also seen stage version 5 times and still get teary eyed at end it
also a great disney . had wonderful moral dont always go for whats on the outside has music too
best disney movie ever . incredible animation and the story has real heart songs are some of heard in a
this is absolutely possitively one of the greatest walt disney cartoon movies around . i was little when first saw it but am still rather fond now
beauty and the beast taught me (since i first saw it) that looks don't count as much personality does . admire this classic by walt disney ingenue in cartoon is really vry right about issues
a timeless and classic story for the ages . interesting characters it's very well designed along with nice songs all young children some adults as
i love them all , but must say this is my favorite of disney's animated features . it gives little girls an intelligent role model and the moral story(it's what's inside that counts) never gets old course animation music are wonderful
beauty and the beast is a great disney movie . soundtrack really good my little sister liked this brother named out cat 'bell' , main characters name
too scary for little kids but when your old enough it's great
this has to be the only disney cartoon where heroine isn't a bimbo or close one . it good plot , suspense and music
the best disney movie! ! i love it so much .
the highlight of walt's career as a film maker . brilliantly cast , directed and produced fun creative that leaves you smiling
great cast and music . i still love those adorable little penguins in the animated sequence order what you will , there'll be no bill it's complimentary..
yeah , let's teach the little ones it's okay to pawn thier care off on an insane domestic ! brilliant
i enjoyed this movie very much but it did make me afraid of windy days and umbrellas for awhile .
a roman epic . russell crowe rocks as maximus good gladiator scenes , great special effects and costumes add to the realism of this movie
when i first saw mary poppins was four years old and loved the songs magic . julie andrews is fabulous as practically perfect eponymous heroine am now 21 still love , it my favourite film any that can captivate different generations after almost half a century has to be something special child you will energy enthusiasm of it's playful creativity way brings out in each character an adult appreciate depth story rare children's movies redemption father figure truly touching david tomlinson's performance incredible.much movie aimed at pleasing all this one which called family picture there no better advert for disney films than splendid !
loved it then  , love now--measures up practically perfect in every way !
it doesn't get any better than this . its one of those rare movies that is even the book/s incredible cast great songs and early with scenes containing both live actors animation
feed the birds tppins a bag toppins . love that song loved movie very origional and entertaining what an awesome idea for
the movie's great -- almost as good p.l . travers book scene on rooftops of london is fantastic , magical
looking back it amazes me that there were so many great films released for children when i was at just the perfect age to appreciate them and file in my best loved stuff memory archive . this no exception regardless of fact wasn t much into musicals even then (i have always preferred hearing straight dialog) - really mary poppins  wonderful on other levels first all , adored turn century london setting as well old house costumes wacky adventures took running around rooftops probably favorite what a radically magnificent thing do ! also fascinated with way traveled via umbrella course still mist up think sweet lady sitting steps st paul s feeding birds is definitely classic flick
marry poppins is one of the best family movies all time . songs are just outragious especially a spoon full sugar makes medicine go down 
classic
a terrific movie about magical nanny who takes the children she watches on wonderful adventures . place in england 1910 dad is banker has no time for his kids mom suffragette also little jane and michael mary poppins arrives after write their own letter nanny.julie andrews as , so dick van dyke bert my favorite part when they jump through pictures park mix animation with live action.good songs too !
one of the best movies i have ever seen . nonstop action and a storyline that draws you in
this movie was on tv at the beginning of feb . 2001 , and i upstairs suddenly heard chim chimney or what ever they call that song ready to cry ! it something hear again being a dismal rainy day instanly reliving my olden days favorite through much childhood actually crying when came downstairs saw so caught up in memories past couldn't believe myself
this film is truly practically perfect in every way , and it's one of my all time favourites . julie andrews plays the part irrepressible nanny mary poppins extremely well her voice so soothing that i have fallen asleep during he song stay awake on numerous occassions ! dick van dyke an excellent bert despite his absolutely awful attempt at a cockney accent david tomlinson also top form as uptight father george banks superb which will make you cry laugh same love
a very sweet movie for all ages , warning the song feed birds is so beautiful i used to cry whenever it was on !
one of my top 5 disney favorites . it never gets old
mary poppins has everything : music , magic suspense and a happy ending . all ages can watch it enjoy together it's practically perfect in every way
this movie is awesome . the animation amazing and it has great morals for kids along with humor stimulating colors only negative aspect to how many times you'll end up having watch over if you have gets a lot less funny after 35 in one month
i think this is the best childrens movie out there . it has many hidden morals
excellent movie . though some said it was too gory or violent , the gladiator topped my box office this summer amazing emotional action packed and touching i almost cried
the best disney movie ever . i never laughed that hard in a dori is just hilarious ellen degeneres did an outstanding job hope they'll do second one this not for kids , it whole family and usually don't care movies
this movie is the best ever ! its worth watching it
this was a great movie i can sit through like !
i laughed , cried and clapped like a lunatic at the end . must-see !
one of the best disney/pixar collaborations.great story and animation . worthy disney animated standards
i love the seagulls . mine , mine!! ! lol
finally , a good children's movie in today's lifetimes !
this made harrison ford even more of a star than when he was han solo . odd , better in the jones series but he'll be remebered as
it kicked some butt!!!! !
great acting from russell crowe , and a good plot that kept you thinking . the characters were all had personality movie worked with at end last fight emperor didn't make sense but overall it was
what can i say ? it's a cute movie . the animation is great five stars
es-ca-pe ! that's funny.. . it's spelled just like word 'escape'..
i love this film , it's a classic so funny and dory is the best !
fun , exciting and worth while !
anyone who thinks this is bad a retart .
although not the computer-generated perfection that was toy story 2 , finding nemo is just plain great . character of dory gets a laugh from every line her dialogue and then there hilarious scenes in dentist office seagulls i have to ask though : if this pixar film where are outtakes ?
great action and story . similar to braveheart 
the first time i watched this movie , really didn't care much for it . but have seen several times since then and love message of is great too almost all characters except that whiny marlin even his annoying character doesn't ruin me ellen degeneres did an astounding job as dory...i highly recommend families everywhere single people  ! not just a children's movie..
this film can be liked by people of all ages . the animation is superb i'd say it's pixar's best animated story sweet and very funny , especially ellen degeneres as dory each character's personality warm humerous an important part a movie you'll want to watch many times over delightful
we like the film . especially voice from german speakers want to look again and , but money is missing !
one of the most brilliant things in this movie is environment . colors are just amazing , and they've got every detail perfect- from light reflecting off water to smooth texture enemony where nemo lives stuff floating around plot too a story about young clownfish named with an over-protective father they get seperated when caught by diver taken sydney nemo's frantically searches for him comes across fish dory who can help find his son- if it wasn't her short term memory loss two go through many obsticals nearly being dinner shark swimming field jelly all while cracks fear ocean meanwhile dentist's fishtank he meets tank gang which includes some interesting characters end re-united learns be less cautious anout everything was both touching hysterical stars albert brooks ellen degeneres were really good at deteriorating that joke....which either or bad...and perfect playing short-term
this was no doubt the best movie in my mind . it is good for all age groups and dory favorite character
i was surprised that liked this one as much did . each fish had it's own unique personality well their dysfunctions it a kids' movie but wasn't sugary sweet
excellent and well done . a single dad so concerned for his child that he will do anything him parents , take lesson
truly enjoyed
not only do my kids love watching this over and , but it's a movie that husband i enjoy with them also . pixar has outdone themselves nemo...the humor is perfectly balanced character-building plot great themes in like loyalty empathy living life as the adventure it agree others ellen d was if best buy it...it's one of those kid movies will actually get watched at your house !
gladiator was a good movie . it classic epic battle between and evil had lot of male testosterone scenes special effects
i love this movie so much! ! the characters are super! it's pixar's best second : toy story flowing with creativity and great animation is sure to not have any rotten tomatoes thrown at it,pixar's greatest!
very well done movie . the characters are lovable and terribly cute story is one of those heart-warming ones you can only get out a kid's flick these days it works for everyone totally original must see !
i love this movie ! so good . best of the pixar films far mount wannahawkaloogie is
pixar rocks !
this is another example of how amazing pixar . the animation was superb and nearly lifelike but even better than effects heart in story what i also liked about it that usually these kinds movies are kids one his overprotective father loved dory bruce ! idea a fish with memory loss strange , turned out to be hilarious cute shark being on twelve step plan free diet good joke all plans there today don't work starfish too having my doubts seeing william defoe doing movie he really shone tank gang were so they each had their own personalities protective bubbles french cleaner crab (or whatever was) thought her reflection sister showed living like for could do things ya  demonic eight year old braces rapped up when asked other adults favorite summer replied finding nemo not seabiscuit or pirates carribean didn't go went see themselves because wanted overall great cast numerous jokes makes by far best summmer truly lived if did surpass toy monsters inc can't wait pixar's next
thankfully pixar's deal with disney is coming to an end so they can make great films without having that sickening touch it . i absolutely loved this film as did the seven guys who watched animation out of world and characters are very funny do love seagulls - 'mate , mate mate....'
i took my daughter to see this movie , and really wasn t expecting enjoy it myself as usually don many animated shows . however was pleasantly surprised is a very cute
while the historical accuracy may not be exact , sets were fantastic . excellent acting especially from russell crowe and joaquin phoenix i also enjoyed seeing some great work old favorites like richard harris oliver reed better than patriot 
awesome film for all ages.... .
great ! one of the best films all time , and animated ones so far voices fit characters well it's funny cute .
pixar did it again ! another really good , funny film . the visuals were amazing and ellen degeneres as dory was hilarious expressions on characters incredible so that you're actually feeling all they're : sad scared happy whatever voices worked well with animation you don't have to be a kid like this movie i loved see in theatre though get full effect surround sound
this movie was incredible!!! ! i laughing the entire time...of course , except for sad parts . so great my new favorite mine (you'll get once you see movie)
the best pixar film of them all . glorious animation , and a hilarious performance from albert brooks flawless
at first , i thought would hate this movie but after saw it decided was one of the best kids' movies out now ! entertaining for my 11 year old sister also me . laughed so much highly suggest seeing in theatre great visual and sound effects
such a cute movie brought forth that whole spagetti thing i wanted to rent it for my daughter but was rented out.. .
this movie is a true disney classic . it has all the aspects ; cute and lovable characters , an evil character (aunt sarah) love story of course happy ending art work excellent are drawn in fashion making sure that bodies dogs people proportioned scene between lady tramp very sweet too by far my favorite as been for 18 years !
one of disney's very best . the characters , like lady tramp and si am siamese cats are vintage disney great songs too
i have always loved this sweet little tale about lady the pampered cocker spaniel and tramp homeless mutt . their worlds were different until they came together when nasty aunt who was babysitting {while lady's owners out of town}tried to put a collar on ran away  scene at restaurant where share plate spaghetti is precious there are other dog characters too peg has been around some humerous scenes sad course all ends well with happy ending new home for tramp.cute disney from my childhood still enjoy
this is a classic animated disney film . lady house dog tramp who lives near the railroad tracks spagetti scene in movie was pretty good another that my favorite
wonderful drawings . i love the story , and characters are more interesting touching than some human beings also like siamese cats
lady and the tramp is by far one of greatest disney movies ever made in movie history . it such a great film , with excellent animation heartwarming touching exciting plot
this movie is wonderful . the old-fashioned styling and pure disney storyline made it very enjoyable
so sweet... . i love the spaghetti scene..
this film is way better than the first one . it's really funny !
this is the only great sequel out there and it's funny wonderful! ! i recommend to turn your frown upside down!
better than the first one !
well , they did it again . toy story 2 is just as enchanting and wonderful the first with great one-liners brilliant animation makes awesome if you liked you'll like this see now summary : sequel to
one of the funniest movies all time , toy story 2 start and ends with a bang . tons references to tv slapstick dialogue visual gags double meanings best cgi around come together form this great film let us not forget always-uprorarious outtakes! !
this movie integrated computer graphics with real life well . it is the modern ben-hur classic was relatively clean had a good simple message great actors
written so well !
not as good #1
this is just as good the first toy story.woody accidentally ends up in a yard sale and stolen by customer who turns out to be collector of old toys . he takes woody with intention selling him finds part collection from 1950s there was even kiddie show about 50s meets jessie,and other playhouse characters meanwhile andy's house set rescue woody.some funny scenes , sad like when jessie remembers her special kid loved at one time then gave away.another well done movie
i didnt think a sequel of kids movie could outshine the first and this one did . hope theres 3
this movie was better than the first . woody gets kidnapped only to find out that he main star of woody's roundup meets jessie and other characters from now has choose if wants be with his owner or new friends also great songs a few take offs movies like wars
i thought that it was quite funny . kept my little brother laughing the whole time is not best for adults but if your looking something to keep alittle kid out of hair a while aweaome part movie blooperes those were seriously most sequels are bad this almost as good second one recommend
better than the original by far.. . it's funny as hell , and has great imitations of other movies e.g star wars if you don't see this will regret it my only complaint is new character jesse who most annoying voice ever in a cartoon but let spoil woody buzz's adventure terrific movie for all! !
this one is way better than toy story . i'm not saying the first bad , but a blast! ! my friend and i were two crazy adults laughing out tears in theatre graphics are excellent plot fantastic funny touching at same time definitely recommended
amasing - best film i've ever seen in my life it helps having such a hunk as the main character ten out of had all !! !
it was hilarious and the graphics were fab !
great time and lots of laughs !
very cute movie . it is open to those young and old any audience would love this the voices of characters are well known actors actresses , which draws a lot viewers go see
i can't believe they outdid the original ! wow
i love cartoons , so this movie did it all . had comedy drama and the toys actually emotion hope toy story 3 is in makes disney has done again with their magic because of film
great ! i saw it four times . a very powerful movie with excellent costumes the computer effects were nearly seamless good character development , and storyline
i enjoyed this movie because even though it was a cartoon , still exciting . also full of comedy that easy to understand especially when they had the bad guy say am you father fake buzz lightyear everyone knew came from star wars
good movie for kids , plenty of excitement...keeps children attentive .
yes for the home team ! this was a great movie kids and us big .
i love this movie ! the animation was incredible . is hilarious liked whole star wars spoof thing at end characters were pretty life-like and believable i'm looking forward to seeing what pixer will produce in future
although the movie is aimed at children , both kids and adults can appreciate enjoy this . it very funny animation remarkable
disney has done it again . this sequel , i thought put toy story over the top movie had feeling emotion and character hopefully will come back with 3
cute . bother the original and sequel were great i own them both it makes you look at toys in a whole new light
just as good if not better than toy story .
this is like the best movie , it so funny !
i liked this sequel even better than the first one! ! and it is geared more towards adult viewers children .
loved it
not just for kiddies . wonderful story and animation funny touching..
hilarious and action packed . don't be fooled into thinking this is a film for kids only the adult humor in it pretty good
this is a great movie for all ages . one that should be seen by everybody
this movie is excellent . the graphics are improved over original (except for humans , they still too reflective) story line interesting kids and adults taking lines from many of our favorite classics  while i thought adult humour was a little much child-oriented barbie dance scene buzz lightyear's reaction to jesse had me rolling in aisle with laughter highly recommend film
the first and probobly best of indy trilogy , i could watch it over . whole is spectacular (temple doom my least favorite however) character indiana jones a real person portrayed perfectly by classic harrison ford general ideas in this movie make wonderful although special affects are not exactly up to par with 2003 stuff they still very good esspecially for time when was made plus one-liners great
holy crap , umpa lumpas rock .
i loved this movie was so awsome would love to go that factory with all stuff u can eat want see the new one coming out!!!mmm candy
one of my all time favorites . people keep asking who would have made a better willy wonka than johnny depp in the new version may i suggest crispin glover ? think about it he has that sort creepy look wilder hell , he's period been great !
an extremely entertaining little movie with a good moral point . be and just everything will turn out okay filled literally hundreds of subtle jokes , it simply begs to watched over again i keep hearing this theory that wonka is evil can't see he bit eccentric but in cute funny way was the only peter ostrum charlie ever made dvd version contains best video commentary have heard first gathering child stars sitting down watching check
drug induced , but good .
russell's best so far ! the quick cuts in action scenes were masterfully done .
one of the few movies that i love just as much now did when was kid . younger captivated by candy and mystery chocolate factory an adult this movie because it is absolutely hilarious , songs are so nutty memorable gene wilder brilliant playing willy wonka a timeless classic will be cherished for years to come
i love this film ! it's so magical , isn't wonka world every child's dream ? a fantastic adventure for poor boy who proves that good morals and manners prevails . warm hearted colourful well worth watch or two
the snozberries taste like .
the new willy wonka movie is going to star johnny depp!!!!! ! who better play that part?!!
this is such a creative movie , and who doesn't like factory completely made of candy ? the songs were good too ! fun i whole golden ticket thing wish could win
an awesome movie with great special effects . ridley scott does a job of making the period come to life
this isn't even out in backward old england but i'm sure it will be great . i mean has johnny depp , what more do you want !
so bizarre . candy man one of my alltime favorite songs the tunnel scene is scariest moments in all film
when this comes on tv , the kids are glued to it . i have loved story since my childhood
c'mon...who wouldn't love to explore a world made of candy ?
there hasn't been a film that is as moving gladiator in the whole of movie making history!!!! ! it has just about everything! this gonna be my favorite for really long time!
a very good movie- the perfect movie version of roald dahl's popular book . fine way proving that if you have faith , your dreams can come true
i really liked willy wonka and the chocolate factory when was little now watch it i'm doubled over with laughter . recomend this to anyone kids or just for your own enjoyment
okay , . i admit am of the age group that was a kid when this movie came out (and subsequently shown on tv once year) so loved it from childhood but about 8 years ago in my mid-20's saw again and songs all are great (excepting one never liked cheer up charlie ) you simply have to admire gene wilder's awesome perforamce done with knowing smile other kids quite memorable (especially how they dispatched) there is now rock band called veruca salt will grace recently mentioned august gloop classic !
exceptional movie with great acting by gene wilder . the whole concept is wonderful and it a good way to get away from real world lose yourself in of imagination if somehow you haven't already seen this purchase immediately see for how terrific
still one of my all time faves ! i heard they want to remake it and hope never do .
gladiator is an edge of your seat bloodbath with plot twists that are very strange . some the scenes slow , but end good at explaining it war and combat excellent
gene wilder was great in this movie . the actors were
without a doubt one of the greatest children's movies ever made . very strange,charming and even dark movie musical numbers are incredibly catchy oompa-loompas funny as all hell gene wilder his dry synical sense humor in role willy wonka is great makes wonderful fantasy for entire family highly recommended!! !
this is one of the best classical movies all time . movie also has excellent morals for children ages , and gene wilder with his remarkable performance tops it off
it's a great movie
willy wonka and the chocolate factory is an extremly well done movie , it deserves so much credit . was touching funny just good buy today also gene wilder....you are such a great actor jack albertson excellent too
a definate must-have if they put it out on dvd...i can remember being spooked by the scene in tunnel where they're paddle boat...(i was just wee one when came out.) i'm my 30's now and watch with kids every chance i get , love oompla-loompas watching violet beauregard blow up guessing exact moment glass elevator will break through ceiling . you want to view paradise simply look around it..
one of the few movies from my childhood which i remember with such fondness . everything that happens inside factory is completely mesmerizing and leaves memories still vivid many years later teaches some good lessons to children but also delights them wonders within cast wonderful
one of my favorite all time movies . many magical scenes (also that lead me to believe roald dahl may have been hanging out with lewis carroll) i loved it as a kid , every wish fulfilled the greedy violet gets hers when she tries new candy was told not and turns into huge blueberry you're turning oompa loompas charlie grandpa so mesmerized by entire factory wise old willy wonka
willy wonka & the chocolate factory is one of my all-time favorite movies . roald dahl was a genius when it came to understanding children , and this movie ideal combination magic mystery adventure fun gene wilder magnificent as eccentric mr who accompanied charlie into were an absolute riot i'll never forget scene where augustus gloop falls river sucked up pipe or violet beauregarde turns giant blueberry rolled off be de-juiced in many ways very scary for but that's part what makes so much i make point see at least once year
this is a better movie for adults than children . i think it little too scary in some spots kids that being said , great and perfect adaptation of the novel charlie chocolate factory gene wilder perfectly cast as wonka collection child actors wonderful it's kind amazing given quality their performances they were largely never heard from again
i watched it not that long ago and seemed like there were a lot of weird scenes . sometimes is little scary , when willy wonka takes them through dark tunnel all these werid things are flashing by was even quick shot chicken stuggling pretty you watch now don't notice those kid
there is a child in all of us and this classic proves it . remains my movie choice on rainy weekends i have never read the book but know imagination could not create magnificant landscaping presented film are songs galore that easy to sing along some scenes may be frightening small -- still close eyes during gondola ride !
this movie was excellent.better than "mulan".robin williams rocks!!!and all of the other characters are outstanding!!!even iago when he on jafar's side!!!i also loved music!! !
this was my first movie that i saw as a three year old and now get to see it on dvd is so awesone obsessed with still always treasure !
a magicial , cool classic it's fun! !
this is the funniest of all disney movies , thanks in large part to robin williams . definitely a movie that people should own
this is another great disney movie . aladdin a boy who's only friend monkey named abu has lot of songs like me and prince ali the genie [ voiced by robbin willams} my favorite character funny cute to see
the best disney movie ever . it has great voice talents , e.g robin williams and also says memerable actually enjoying songs that don't annoy you it's a not only for children but anyone ! video to add your collection
good cast , well acted moving disturbing yet enjoyable . the plot takes enough twists and turns that you remain interested despite basically already knowing end exciting
this is among robin williams' finest performances . he provides the voice for aladdin and hysterical sure , it a children's movie but definitely one that adults will enjoy just as much his lines are similar to many riffs on talk shows only lot funnier
ahh , shalom and good evening to you worthy friends ! please come closer-uh too close a little there.. . welcome agrabah city of mystery enchantment-and the finest merchandise this side river jordan one down
great music . good fun clean enjoyable entertainment
i loved it think had cool songs and the voices when great werent oddly off dont ment that u should disobay ur father its jus have to go for what is right even if means would get mad cuz they can be un reasonable liked crab he was
this is a fantastic classic it's one of my favorites!! . awesome! ! great characters wonderful music! and beautiful love story
as most of you have gathered from my weblist , i'm a huge unabashed disney fan . this is truly favorite and one the best in opinion sweet story paired with fantastic unique voicework that brought to life unforgettable characters who can forget wonderful fun music ? i will admit sometimes films are blandly entertaining but had spunk reach many age groups creating lasting cartoon classic
the best disney movie of all time .
one of my family's favorite films . well done in every way great songs , and the villains are too we have watched this many times never get tired it
the movie begins in a gruesome way , but ends up quality . russell crowe's performance was amazing plot is well written and moves quickly
i use to watch the movie everyday
this is the best movie disney did along with lion king . i have seen it 50 times and love all songs movies 1 little mermaid 2 kind aladian ...a tie 3 toy story2
this movie came out when i was in junior high school and loved it . the songs name ariel mermaids , of course didn't admit to anyone
brilliant movie .
an excellent movie! ! the creativity is amazing and movie overall winner . definitely reccommended for kids adults as well! if you haven't seen it , rent right now
the movie got a little tedious at times , but on whole it was an exciting . i thought well acted and lines were not too corny liked russell crowes character
this is another pixar materpiece that's way funnier and more appropeate than shrek ! the story two monsters must put a kid back into human world before other destroy them . great animation , talented vioce actors an original makes movie see
how can this be anything less than a 5 ?
i enjoyed this one thoroughly . had a great ending and the voicework of john goodman billy crystal was perfect
this is a example of great creativity and it doesn't meet up to finding nemo or toy story but , flim still worth lot watching so many times .
i love monsters inc . boo is my favorite her she too cute , can't stand it mike and sully are funny the characters so real stuff this movie
this was a wonderful movie.it very clean.i cried ,i laughed.it cute movie . with lovable characters.this is about mike and skully there monsters of course job to scare kids get energy for electricity everyone thinks human are poisinous if you touch them then finds boo(a kid).when trying find her door put back in world boo not poisonus he grows attached her.i would recomend it
an excellent awesome great adventure flick!! !
an excellent epic film . i loved the story , despite some amount of implausability (emperor/gladiator fighting) felt it was very well put together and coordinated with sound track compelled by character maximus
better than great ! perfect what a way to battle the monster in closet.. . he's afraid of you , honey loved it..
this and shrek are the best children's movies since aladdin . they make whole family laugh
incredible movie ! love it completely family-friendly and stunningly-animated , the plot is great original with many jokes but heartwarming at same time . a vocal cast rounds out this awesome picture along outtakes its another pixar classic
yet again - another one that made me cry . billy crystal is absolutely hilarious in this and the character who looks like librarian reminds of grandmother 'dinosaurs' (don't know if anyone remembers show) its very sweet little girl adorable i want a monster my closet !
this movie is perfect . great animation , funny yet dramatic at the same time let me change that above to histerical  even though its two main characters (mike and sully) play off of each other perfectly
this is a movie we really enjoyed ! after several duds released from disney,this was great trest!we can't wait until it on dvd so can watch over and over!!
monsters , inc . was a great movie i saw it at least three times ! would recommend this to everyone

greatest childrens movie ever and i need just one word . scrat!(and its not that bad to watch if you are an adult as well ask me)
a wonderful epic . few recent hollywood films have been able to produce comprehensive that the audience can tolerate russell crow was great choice
excellent animation , hillarous plot with funfilled unforgettable characters that will have children constantly beginning their parents to buy this movie on dvd . the sloth had me rotflmao(figuratively speaking)for talking and becoming an annoyance sabertooth cat was a sly meticulous character makes wanna shout ! reminded of three men baby i am glad both animals put aside laws nature by forming symbiosis relationship anb friends recommended for all ages
this is a fun filled adventure just hit play when the movies in and youre off its about wolly mamouth sloth baby comes from village his mom gives him to willy because she jumps cliff then mean sabratooth tiger has plan try get so they can eat it well that doent stop he saves day but youll have 2 watch how.... .
this is a hilarious movie . the small bits with squiral and acorn made it even better
the film isn't that great but goran visnjic is in it . yay !
what a great movie for the whole family to watch . i found myself laughing more than my kids did
a heart-warming tale with the mixed wonderful personalities of great characters you've got entertaining animated flim worth watching , recommended yes! !
great movie for the kids . plenty of humor grown-ups , too
one of the best movies year , ice age is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment . voice cast well-rounded animation stunning and script awesome banter crackling with wit there are tons visual gags even an uproarious star trek reference for ones eyes it not only funny also warm touching has very positive ending ! highly recommended all
this movie kicked butt!!! ! is the all time best children/adult i have ever seen! can't wait to buy dvd .
i can be such a girlie - admit , parts of this made me cry (i know pathetic) thought was really sweet little story about litle group misfits who usually wouldn't have anythhing to do with eachother but bond due one cute human baby . the animation is good and denis leary great diego character sid soooo another film that kids adults watch enjoy together
really funny !
good cartoon .
amazing . on the edge of your seat great acting , romance a movie for everyone
this movie is a must see if you want to laugh until cry . something for everyone the best way describe film have manny mammoth and even though he pretends not care , has heart of gold there sid sloth talks mile minute always says wrong thing at time diego sabertooth who only wants revenge on humans adorable little baby adapts being cared by animals course scrat bug-eyed thing,that can't live without his acorn go ahead take family one you'll all home
dot is sooooo cute
this is the cutest movie i ever did see . it was also first animated that watched tried to make all characters more realistic by applying bloopers at end worked wonderfully considering don't even like bugs , one of my favorite family movies kevin spacey does a great job too in supplying voice for hopper
utterly fantastic ! this great 3d animation cartoon is fully equipt with famous voices , (such as dave foley) terrific cute bugs and some one liners that make it fun appealing to both adults children alike . if you haven't seen you're missing out i bought movie because was so funny original 100% better than the try-hard warner bros antz  a heart-warming film tha teaches us good things in lfie full of adventure humerous anecdotes throughout
beautifully crafted . great songs classic animation one of the best disney classics every
this is such a great movie for children . i guess every adult's wish if they cannot have to real life child pinocchio be able come and learn from right wrong values being teached
quite possibly the best disney animated masterpiece ever , although it's still a toss-up between this snow white fantasia bambi and 101 dalmations .
i think this is a great movie . although prefer the lion king , it's still beautiful tale of puppet who wants to be real boy didn't much live action one that was made recently though some good songs classic know it so old but then again snow white and seven dwarves peter pan are really too summary : heart-warming
it is excellent animation and a good story . it's probably one of the first movies i would show to my kids walt disney his crew were wonderful this definitely masterpieces
when you wish upon a star , makes no difference who are i can still hear the diminutive cricket s voice as he very soberly looks up into heavens . pinocchio is disney at its best and most pure great story moral expertly produced animation even now with all our 21st century computer generated sophistication have to admire creativity talent skill vast amount of time that went producing such gem timeless animated feature
after taking my ancient world art class in the spring , watching movie gladiator was an exciting experience . i able to understand and culture of romans that we had learned about on film best architectural description they roman ampitheatre think did a really great reconstruction
i still love the muppets . if live to be 100 , will them there are some things you just never outgrow !
honestly how can you not love the muppets ?
i like how kermit sang the rainbow song and thought that miss piggy was so sexy muppets are best forever !
give that pig an academy award .
you got to love seeing kermit on a bike .
one of the best disney animation movies every made . bestchildrens !
this movie was outstanding and such a great for children to watch . the dwarfs were cute loveable especially dopey ! he so funny his pointed ears just wants make you smile of course in about every is source evil that snow white's step mom how truly she on earth why would kill her child be most fairer world overall it incredible
the first disney animated movie , and among best .
a very good movie . the acting is top notch , and depiction of corruption great this tends to be bloddy however that was true lifestyle from history books i have read russell crowe an award winning actor shows his best in film
why isn't there a 100000 in this ratinnnnggg?????!! !
an absolute classic . not to be missed they don't make disney films like this anymore beautiful and touching , it's essential todays movies i've watched it 3 times before i still (no i'm 7 years old) do miss summary : a tale that cannot
it is excellent animation and a good story . it's probably one of the first movies i would show to my kids walt disney his crew were wonderful this definitely masterpieces
a great movie . this was the one that started it all snow white is girl who finds house where seven dwarfs live they find her and befriend classic for ages to enjoy
well , this was the first full-length cartoon film which makes it astonishing that quality is so high time around . i love bit when snow white says ...and you must be grumpy ! those seven dwarves had more character in them than thousands and of performances by real actors we've seen over years amazing
i love dalmations ! cruella was some sick lady who had to have fur or die trying . my favorite the real people one but this is cool because of way dogs talked
this is truley one of the best movies ever . i've watched it tons times and each time i watch love more  a beautifully animated movie that's hilarious full wonderful , unforgetable funny characters my favorite are definetly horace jasper badun it's awesome that will always have special place in heart another million times!! ! .i so much you too!!!
what a great movie ! the cast and all dalmatians were superb .
this is one of my favorite movies all time . i never get tired watching it it's a nice , fun story with good characters and i'm just huge sucker for dogs ;0)
this is a classic and one of the best animated disney films . cruella devil want dalmatian puppies to make fur coat , but owners won't let her
superb ! i went to see it when was six and just loved my all time fave for animation
a classic! ! one of the best cartoons all time . i'll definitely show this to my kids
this movie was excellent . great story line and action i would recommend to everyone
great disney release . rendition of classic children's character movie for young and old
i love this movie so much! ! it's a powerful , imaginative story with lots of fun and disney magic!! . highly recommended for anybody!!
peter pan is my favoritest disney movie . it so great and tinker bell the best
i've always loved watching this one . until recently i didn't realize how old some of these disney movies are- peter pan came out in 1953 ! the animation quality is amazing and it's crazy to think that it was made 50 years ago without computers or anything other things noticed are same voice actor does voices for captain hook mr darling when wendy , michael john thinking merry little thoughts during their flight training they mention mermaid lagoons pirate ships indians believe- all which neverland so suppose kind created be what great movie (if you can get past if there's a star your heart song plays at beginning credits never ceases disgust me) with message got action humor everything
why do i think this is such a great movie ? dunno..i'm making up as go ;)
this is definitely the best disney movie ever .
the best to come along in a long time . it is entertaining and very funny donkey steals show this one i could watch over again
i love this movie ! think it's clever and very funny . really more for older children adults , but all of my kids know it word found unique refreshing..
great movie , for kids and grown ups . i haven't laughed that hard in a very long time mike myers eddie murpy cameron diaz they all did job
before shrek i had never laughed at anything related to fairy tales . really clever , and a great soundtrack
good movie with great animation . moral vocal performances by mike myers and eddie murphy
loved it ! the show wouldn't have been anything w/o eddie murphy though
this movie was very clever . i amazed how the writers were able to make it funny for children as well adults
shrek was an excellent movie . i love these family oriented films that have a really deep meaning actually shed tear during the scene where all main characters had separated after thought fiona didn't want him and sad song playing they were thinking about each other it just moving moment for me (i broken up with significant myself lol) great film , very funny too
so far the best movie of 2000 .
amusing for kids of all ages ! even the thirty year old ones
apparently the people that rated this movie 1 star...had never seen . it is brilliant!! !
best movie ever !
i absolutely loved this movie . it was so cute , because pretty much a spoof of all the fairy tales had real good meaning involving looks isn't that important as some people make out to be ooh and funny just say again
one of the best movies i've ever seen . it had good battle scenes , a story and was just awesome ! i am going to see again
great movie . i havent met a child that doesnt like it , and the only adults dont are compaining about adult jokes true there is humor but well written so young children will not be scandalized they remain as innocent were before can sit with their watch together
i totally think shrek should be the top movie ! it was awesome
one of my favorite !
a great movie for both children and adults , though the humor at times was directed to an older audience . computer animation really cool as well casting good too
funny,funny,funny
i missed part of the opening battle but i'm going back because haven't seen anything that dark and thunderous since excaliber . favorite scene where carthenian gladiators flip chariot, , maybe hollywoodish awesome effects then end brought a tear to my eye this guy wasnt just raw fighting machine he had thoughts desires needs did it for his family her man onced looked up could care less about exact accuracy film gist politics summed twistedness now must see
i got that movie at home . love it like the ending when all people are singing it's best !
shrek is a great movie . it will have you laughing till cry eddie murphy as donkey hilarious!! ! he does job!!
shrek deserves 5 stars . i love the disney references i.e snow white , magic mirror long lines etc cast was great too think john lithgow makes a good villian
funny , and all of the people in a family would like it
i love this movie!! ! it s fabulous , can t wait for to come out sale . everything about is good - the story voices soundtrack ending characters that dragon and shrek,and everybody else best animation movie done in past years it!
this is the funniest and one of best movies year !
shrek would still be excellent entertainment even without the voice of eddie murphy , but it wouldn t have sparkled quite as much . this state art animated film never ceased to amaze and amuse on several levels at once one most impressive things about was very realistic attention detail facial expressions were especially spoke volumes personality each character lighting so oddly real looking i noticed a couple times what appeared lens spot glare young children will enjoy action characters won get more off wall stuff point since appears all earmarks future classic them no doubt watching with their own families one-day
i have to give this movie five *s , even though it was fairly disorienting . the characters came through cgi but shading and jerky movements always rang artificial me guess i'm just not used medium anyway it's a good story with an unconventional hero as sure you've heard very worth watching kids will love whether they know all fairy tales that references or my favorite part is sometimes devilish wit employs show has edge keep audience interest at times where other kid movies would sag from pure sugariness in words enough for adults real time
i had to cover my eyes during the gory parts but love seeing history come alive ! wonderful sets and action scenes .
i loved this movie . when first heaaard about a new coumputer animated , recalled the disatrous toy story and other evils but shrek really was great filled with warmth humour happy ending
great movie ! funny cast
wicked !
an all around great movie . we brought our boys..ages 4 and 5..and everyone enjoyed shrek i sit through many childrens' movies for the sake of my kids (although have dozed off now again found myself bored to tears in others) but this ranks up there with best myers , murphy diaz do excellent job as well lithgow animation is unbelievable story line moralistic while being entertaining humorous husband were entertained duration movie..the stab at disney was hilarious plenty adult humor that hope flew right over kids' heads highly recommend unless you are overly sensitive want ultracensored childrens movie..they say a** reference donkey..the gingerbread man does eat me a few references flatulence..for family none problem..but know some people who would be horrified..not us loved !
awesome movie dreamworks di da great job of making a that kids and adults would enjoy . ending too
great movie . russell crowe is one of the finest actors out there , and he sells this hero well ! backgrounds were much critisized but i was very impressed cannot see what all complaints about opening scene riveting felt more real then battle scenes in braveheart
i don't know as would say it's a kids movie at all , though i'm sure they enjoy it also . has wonderful message and was delight to watch laughing like crazy one minute shed tear or two the next alot of fun shatters some fairy tale ideals we had grow up with-finally highly recommend
this was a great movie!it had some parts that were inapropriate for little kids , but it made so would go over heads . soem of the still laughed i don't think they understood probably just because everyone else did am pree-teen loved surprising ending and very funny -amy
i thought shrek was awesome ! went to see it two times . its a good movie for everyone the jokes arent childish,but theyre not dirty every body will enjoy this movie.its definetely worth your time and money
this was a great film . it funny and clever the donkey my favorite had lot of fairy tale characters all through movie shrek an ogre but he nice princess secret , i wont give away go see has surprises in
our family saw shrek today . we all really liked it was a fairy tale that ages could enjoy an ogre and donkey have to save princess bring her back this want be king in movie there are lot of the characters heard about for year i t is very clever can funny has music even adults some humor older kids but little will not get.eddie murphy as donkey.we considered rare treat whole
this is a great movie ! must see it hilliouras , eddie murphy so fuuny!the only bad part that there some swearing.it very good though
awesome ! has script and dialog so well executed , that children adults will view the same scene burst out laughing for totally different reasons . song with disneyish blue bird still kills me film is clever message driven can be enjoyed on many levels hum maybe like an onion  just go enjoy
great movie for kids and adults . very funny!! !
this is a very good movie with meaningful morals i am glad they covered . it covers the meaning of freindship and what true beauty also gets point across that disney movies are lame shrek has enough crassness to be concedered modern , but wonderful messages convey original ways them ahead its time remember beast ? how turned into handsome (by most peoples standards) at end expect none in film love can come from inside your heart doesn't matter other person looks like actually made me tear up couple spots laughed my arse off some parts.alot parts think great for all ages mean jokes could over kids heads you know youth today have crap on t.v porn internet sure they'll get about power friendship highly recommended date
fun for parents and kids .
took the family to see shrek last weekend ; what a great movie . producers and writers really did good job of combining some adult level thinking with child targeted story line that kept us all interested laughing there are lots jabs at disney others make humor clean enjoyable i m not big eddie murphy or myers fan but thought they an excellent vocally creating their characters few unnecessary words here seemed pasts quicker than kids could pick up would highly recommend for any outing hats off dreamworks well done
i still do my sloth impression at ball games . it will get quiet for a moment and i'll belt out "hey you guys!" or "baby ? baby.. ruth?"
another all-time "good bad" movie that's fun for any age . the main plot trigger is far-fetched (piracy along oregon coast?) , but you're not watching it with an historical treatise in mind anyway this one to plop down onto a recliner (snuggled under blanket some popcorn on cold nothing day) and take unfettered great names associated production (spielberg chris columbus) raft of 80s actors (corey feldman kerri green lotr's sean astin ke huy quan inimitable john matuszak anne ramsey martha plimpton etc.) that you can't help cheer fantastic sets locations (hardly anything prettier than astoria) non-stop action (virtually free all rubbery cgi) pratfalls guffaws translate well 20 years later if find something like about screen fave just trying very hard good enough !
the best movie of 80's . i used to watch it all time with my sister and now bought on dvd kids
one of my all time favorites
a great film that gets more and entertaining each time i watch it . for kid's movie  , thought the characters were really well developed actors did fine job of portraying them story humor adventure
one of my top faves when i was a kid , and still enjoy it today . great story bunch adventerous kids made every know want to be goonie
this is one movie never gets boring no matter how many times i watched it . not the greatest actors , but an excellent plot
if your child ever wants to go explore , show him this movie . i have loved since jr high looking for it locally so can buy but looks like will from amazon
i felt like giving this movie a four or three star rating until really thought about it . what was wrong with the goonies ? has to be one of most entertaining family films ever made watched couple days ago at glorybox's house and remember how great actually is even if kind dark sinister an overall fun good humored vibe watching when young not getting alot might confuse scare some younger viewers wouldn't consider childrens more comedy its heart in right place found refreshing other day rather pleasent lack ass jokes no farts,no rectal cavity mishaps , ! something whole can watch without haveing see take sh*t anyway anyone who hasn't seen again...for first time (wow my hokeyness amazes me sometimes.) highly recommended
who didn't like the goonies ? i have watched this movie at least 100 times and it only gets better . a bunch of unpopular kids follow an old treasure map that belonged to pirate named one eyed willy came out when was kid all my friends love as they are being chased by 3 criminals encounter many booby traps along way in end discover willy's save their town arrested any will
i loved this movie ! not your typical action flick . the story line is well thought out and believable if you like exciting movies that have heart , then you've got to see one
i couldnt wait to see this movie . took my granddaughter it and was great the audience never stopped laughing everyone seemed really enjoy even though donkey just as funny time puss in boots that stood out
on par with the first movie , but i knew what to expect humor this one . it still left me in stitches good movie..
a very funny film that attracts people and children alike which is quite rare in . just as good the first one i think
lmao comedy i know this is a great dreamworks hit .
i think this one is better than the first ! it's adult humor and funny charectors kept my family laughing to end
just a hint lower than kb vol . 1 , but still great ! thanks qt
gotta love shrek .
very funny and enjoyable...i think this is the first time dreamworks animation really hit a home run . antonio banderas' puss in boots of course scene-stealer
shrek and fiona are back in this hysterical sequel to the amazing first film . here's plot : (voiced by absolutley wonderful mike myers) (cameron diaz) get from their fantasy honeymoon find that they invited meet fiona's mom dad , who turn out be king queen of a hoity-toity kingdom appropriately named far away i'll let you figure rest with genius voices myers diaz eddie murphy (the irresistible donkey) antonio banderas (as gut-busting-funny assasin kitty-cat) chuckle every five seconds is summer movie must see
just a wonderful movie ! lots of laughs , great annimation murphy and myers were . antonio banderas as puss in boots was nice twist the only part i didn't like fairy godmother highly recommend this one
one of few sequels to exceed the original , and as if wasn't good enough !
deserves more stars than five . this is a classic and because of it's setting also timless(like star wars) was the first film that showed ford cuold be much han solo.(and to think tom selleck offered role first)might have seemed good then would seem really bad now my favorite part when ark being transported on ship inside crate with nazi swastika it  , suddenly hateful symbol begins slowly burn totally comsumed by holy fire awsome scene hinting at ultimate power god
terrific movie , and who couldn't love that donkey . this was truly a very memorable lived up to all it's expectations
this is my favorite movie so far year !
i loved this cute , funny adventurous movie . the first one as well is of my favorite family films think character time around was puss-n-boots ! what a riot he best scenes when made that helpless face where his eyes got all big and put ears back lol whole audience said awwwwwww.. did antonio banderas really good voice fairy godmother intriguing too amazed at how realistic their facial expressions were especially hers arrogant prince charming alright donkey usual self cute.. ;-)
better than i thought it'd be .
i was shunned among my friends for saying the first one better .
easily superior to the original , shrek 2 is a comic tour-de-force . there are plethora of theatrical and televisionic references from godzilla price right even lord rings there's also some other forms delightfully silly chipper humor animation better with trees looking darn near realistic voice acting solid across board but antonio banderas's puss-in-boots truly steals show jennifer saunders as fairy godmother hilarious musical sequences enjoyably fast-paced upbeat backed up great gags more
sherk 2 was better than the first one .
shrek 2 is a great movie . it's one of those rare gems that kids and adults will get kick out like the first , it pokes satire at everything with rapier-like wit computer animation has also imporved since sometimes i thought they were cutting into real world footage for some shots disney really hasn't made anything in years matches humor cleverness shreks even strong enough to withstand eddie murphy curse only knock have on not quite equal but other than godfather what sequel ? win best animated feature oscars
this movie was a blast for adults . i laughed at all the clever jokes similar to finding nemo it had more than enough engage and entertain
easily the best claymation production ever created , chicken run is highly imaginative and very well done . plot simple enough--chickens want out bad guys don't them to do so throw in an american rooster (mel gibson what arguably his movie) you've got a great set-up for comedy although much of humor inspired zaniness dumb villains there are some clever pop culture references which uproarious reference original star trek series
this one is a gem . it has lot of jokes that will probably go over kids heads , but that's okay i don't believe in talking down to anyway
this movie was filled with a lot of great action , and even though it dealt different time period the audience could still keep attention . also had suspense to which made you want finish watching
this was a pretty good movie . it's from the same creator of wallace and gromit  farm chickens try to escape being chicken pies they get help rooster that think can fly
this is such a great movie - it's so funny anyone in any age can watch it i wount be surprised if the adults who love most laugh ! damn , volks :-))
fantastic! ! c it or you'll regret this is an original piece that so entertaining , not because makes you laugh to death but of it's very subtle humour and classic-gags . one u can watch over again great 4 adults kids the characters are well-defined even oscar worthy time effort put into film shines through for collection
nick park and his powers of imagination is an inspiration to us all . thank goodness there are still people who believe in using their minds reaching for the highest point comedy instead lowest sure , chicken run isn't everyone but my kids love it i did was nice watch something together laugh have fun
i'm 11 years old.i thought this movie was great!! ! i've seen it 3 times and i rate my favorite movie!i've been waiting for to come on video pleased say its coming out november 21 . think everyone should see chicken run!!!
i thought the movie was great for all ages . plot kept adults interested , and claymation entertained kids it a well-rounded that appealed to types of audiences
i have enjoyed claymation since was a kid . own the wallace gromit series and to see new twist great characters were funny full of life , plot enjoyable you really rooted for chickens
this movie was superb ! we saw it four times . the humor is exceptional alot of missed by american audience , probably but love nick parks and wallace gromit characters were fantastic enjoyed every bit as much our nine year old daughter cheyenne babs one favorites
claymation features from the creators of wallace and grommit . zany british humor is amusing for kids , yet sophisticated enough adults best sequence great escape chicken pot pie making machine
this movie is a visual masterpiece . the time and effort it took to make film far surpasses over hyped computer trash put on by dreamworks or disney has true artistic skill great script add ! i recommend anyone
i thought chicken run was fantastic!!! ! found it to be a fresh break from all of the other garbage that has been released lately! bravo job nick parks...it takes an extreme amount time and ambition produce film such character.... .
i really think that nick parks is a master of masters in the specialized world puppet animation , and even though he did not personally move puppets around this his first feature film eye for detail dry brit humor rings through . saw sneak screening when movie was over hid bathroom snuck with next audience just to see it again
this was better than the original version.much more information!!!and totally hilarious!!!i loved it!! !
my childhood , and the childhoods of those i know would not be complete without this movie . cartoon crap jim carrey one..
dr.suess was genius with the christmas special it's funny , classic and a very good cartoon movie! !
best christmas movie of all time !
funny ! no one else could play the grinch but jim carrey
this is a great movie to see around the holidays . jim carrey plays as grinch who plots steal christmas also good because it explaned why hated in first place my favorite character max dog
the movie brought out kid in me . i found myself cheering theater like a child again liked feeling it gave , and wouldn't mind seeing jim carrey was hilarious
this movie is soooo good! ! russel crowe such a good actor it isn't common that with no big names attached to does , but one definately my new favorite
omg ! this movie is my most favortist in the world i laughed so much anad think jim carrey acted sooo good . no one could ever play grinch as he did still played a mean character and stil made u laugh tohught was cute baby , hard when trying to find something wear like dancing mirror aaaahahah cant wait till it comes out on video!!!
another excellent disney movie . all the animals in jungle are a hoot to watch , and who doesn't want sing along with classic bare necessities  ?
man , i love this movie my favorite as a kid . it will always hold place in heart not fan of disney but like one very lovable
they don't make kids films like used to . this was a stunning film excellent plot where mere child finds book entitled the never ending story - you follow with him key force of destruction in tale is nothing literally non-existence or lack imagination world which neverending takes place , fantasia ; conglomerate universe composed dreams and hopes all people main protagonist atreyu alter ego real life boy who reading confused ? if haven't seen it then do ! special effects for 1984 are pretty amazing use puppets makes experience even more magical *update* j-reilly sound bitter difference opinion so what but really didn't have quote me on everything slate surely capable making your own synopsis without jumping over mine
i have loved this movie since was a child . the imagination of it on such grand scale that just entranced me characters , effects wonderful storyline- all were so unique for its time period even better is book by michael ende if you enjoy film you're sure to love longer in-depth original version
i vaguely remember seeing this and from what it was disturbing
i still watch this whenever it's on tv . my favorite is that huge turtle sneezes so freaky but cool the whole movie rad
now this is a movie . young boy named bastian , being chased by bullies hides in book store there he discovers magical called the neverending story takes and his schools attic begins to read it you experience along with him too much mention princess luck dragon giant turtle morla that's just begining great wonderful ending very imaginative kids adults of all ages will like even music enjoyable special effects costumes
of the recent efforts , this was one my favorites . loved music and story lightly americanized but kept flavor chinese legend great
this movie is my favorite of all animated disney movies! ! it great for kids and parents! the story wonderful there are songs (i do not reccommend sequel : mulan 2)
i loved this movie ! not exactly the classic movies like lion king , or cinderella but definitely entertaining . my kids it isn't needed to be part of disney collection was a good although is
i am a sucker for spunky chick-flick . mulan is great , she's not on some mission women's equality just doing what needs to be done and that she kicks major hun butt very cool
wonderfully entertaining! !
for those of us who regularly watch disney movies (my brother loves them , so every time i new one comes out see it) we got totally spoiled with a string really great ones . this was the last that finally get heroin actually does something besides look beautiful kidnapped or put to sleep whatever and rescued by some man it well-made had very memorable music it's share laughs kids will love most adults know enjoyed too take care everyone !
i looooove this movie!!! ! the first time saw it was when my sister took me to see . start so sad had tears in eyes
this was much better than i had expected it to be . in fact great a story and like the way disney braught piece of history life mixed its own magic an excellent movie for all children some adults
really funny! ! mulan is one strong gal!
my favorite disney movie of all time !
beautifully crafted movie . tearjerker at the end great animation disney classic
i'm not a freak about the indiana jones series , but i like movies . last crusade was my favorite (mostly because it only one understood completely other crusade)
bambi is by far the best disney movie made . unlike garbage they produce today , this favorite children's many memorable scenes it reminds me of my youth every time i watch
you're kidding , right ? bambi is one of disney's all time classics . i like this even better than the lion king  loved story characters and theme man against nature a filled with comedy love sadness for family !
this is a beautiful story with superb animation , and you can tell that walt disney put lot of time love into the making one . only thing it just kills me when bambi loses his mother i understand it's very important part film because about how life really in forest but gets to absolute best from
at the very beginning of picture camera moves (or appears to move) through trees and changing perspective branches gives a 3-d effect . sheer beauty these images is breathtaking then characters are introduced thumper's delicious southern accent mannerisms , flower's modesty ( you can call me flower if want ) antics minor - all combine in rich mixture there music little april showers lovely musical arrangement superbly sung this without mention so far tear-jerking plot wonderful film surely deserves its 5 stars
this is one of the best and most memorable older disney animated feature length films . i still go completely misty when see part about bambi's mother voice thumper cutest ever used in an film a must-have for any collector
one of the most beautiful film i've seen .
awsome , i like the fact that yes kids mom can die !
one of my all time favorite movies . hayley mills is a lot better in this then lindsay lohan the new one..... it classeic and really good actress i love classic parent trap
one of my all-time favorite movies . way better then the new version it hayley mills did a wonderful job on
classic .
great family film . we have watched in several times and never get tired of it hayley mills is fun to watch trying handle the two roles
great ! i love that movie it is my favorite of all time . the one made in 1998 isn't as good but absolutely am addicted to this hayley mills was really and charming funny just better then because mills- who plays twins way film so thats why rated a 5 cause best
this movie is a real stunner . my dad loves it almost as much toy story but i am surprised to see beat the lion king
most pixar films are for the part entire family and incredibles nail mark . every member of can enjoy this it presents super heroes with out making a mockery them movie never really slow down continues to entertain right end must see! !
very funny . i enjoyed this flick terrific for babysitting 
this is a great movie . the best i have seen in long time total 4 thumbs up !
the best movie of 2004
pixar just continues to amaze me . this is probably their best movie i liked how colorful the characters were , animation was spetacular and story fill with action humor that adults kids could enjoy it's truly incredible
speaks to my inner-superhero . holly hunter was inspired casting
awesome cgi film , the best from pixar yet . action and clever ways family uses their powers just floored me by way is it or does little exclamation mark symbol on ria weblists look like an upside-down version of incredibles logo ?
great movie . elastigirl had the best stuff
i have not even seen this movie yet , but already can tell it rocks ! everyone look up the next disney/pixar cars on google and watch trailer . looks ok pretty funny @ start of then goes downhill o well will still see haha
awesome . there's high expectations with pixar animated films , yet this one managed to exceed mine the incredibles puts welcome spins on superhero genre a family is forced into conforming mediocre lifestyle due lawsuit happy society exceptional circumstances inspire them get their groove back brilliantly original kinds of scenes that will delight even most jaded moviegoer don't miss hilarious sequence dangers wearing cape it's more inspired than finding nemo and has in it please adults
this movie happens to be one of my all time favorites . i guess it was adding sean connery in that made better/best it's action packed fun indiana jones ! love harrison ford is the man great storyline
this movie is certainly incredible ! :) with breathtaking computer animation , the incredibles continues pixar's streak of great movies . an interesting twist on superhero story finds people upset heroes and forces them into hiding while i don't think would happen in real life it allows for some comedic moments even typical family happenings are given a super-powered things really get cracking when good vs evil plot set motion action sequences stunning quite possibly best cg scenes ever made there also hilarious references to catch if you enjoy comic books (no capes!) ending all must recommend extremely well-done
pixar movies are the closest thing to sure when it comes box office revenue and critical acclaim (though monsters inc . didn't do much for me) incredibles was a great family movie kids loved had enough keep adult minds thoroughly engaged film's theme is one any middle-aged person can relate -- making comeback after years of dormancy mediocrity animated superhero its day in my generation but seemed fade away as 1-ounce brains peddled dreck like smurfs strawberry shortcake means make children's less violent , i guess (didn't quite work either) cgi technology keeps getting better seems vastly improved over toy story 10 ago does job entertaining us well teaching little lesson on self-esteem not accepting should be favorite best feature at oscars
one of the few family films that i actually enjoyed . it was a charming little superhero movie felt towards beginning film they were trying to show how sue happy americans have become over last years
with every new release from pixar , i have higher expectations . incredibly (ha ha) they hit the mark time not only did improve on their human characters (not strongest in past) more personality and expression than most actors out there i'm exaggerating was enthralled by bit of movie chracters were very well-developed writing as usual priceless - whether it be through dialogue or simply situations get themselves into story again best part but that's what pixar's all about love that studio first eye candy second let me just say is a hell lot top great more-than-believable graphics sound floored caught myself few times my mouth gaping open sheer awe witnessing explosions fast camera action scenery to character animation ocean water wet hair you will amazed if anyone doesn't see this theaters would an incredible shame
another bulls-eye for pixar . one of the few movies that is great all ages and yet doesn't fall into trap being too childish a retired super hero aches to break out run-of-the-mill family man role go back his glory days , he gets it so does rest excellent animation cute storyline ; i can't think bad thing about
great disney release . very ahead of its time use classical music adventure for kids
this is such a great classic movie . not because mickey mouse was the lead but all children could be exposed to master pieces of music what idea have followed by enteraining graphics my favorite part and powerful hat getting out control
just as exiting the other indy movies . loved special effects and plot !
one of the best movies ever made .
if you are not too jaded to enter the spirit of this movie , will find it be a flawless tale love loyalty and understanding . is only heartfelt smart very entertaining funny technically brilliant don't choke up when they lead babe's mom off slaughter should check into get heart inserted ; there may discount for first-time users
classic . and pig in the city is just as great
that'll do , pig.. .
very good , and sad... .
babe is a funny , touching and enduring film about pig that becomes sheep herder . it may be classifyed as children's movie but adults will get great enjoyment out of the well animals in are utterly charming james cromwell superb taciturn owner special
what a sweet movie . pig named babe who end up herding sheep we hear the voices of farm animals , is polite makes friends with other animal one funniest scenes ferdinand  wants to get steal alarm clock in farmers house happens hilarious good family very well done.easy for adults watch too
definitely a great pick ! i loved the addition of sean connery as indiana's father because it injected bit humor into usually-serious storyline . cast had chemistry , script tense and hilarious moments alike adventure was fun always with indiana jones
what a delightful,heartwarming tale,about the adorable little australian piglet who enjoys talking with other farmyard animals,rounds up sheep,and saves his(and his owner's) bacon.this is one film for all family that will surely remain much-loved classic generations to come .
babe had a little too much tongue in cheek humor and realism for me to see it as simply children s film . not that might want watch the biggest part of however , first portion is upsetting similar scene disney dumbo having seen child has stuck with my entire life i m also sure this another aspect way pigs were kept - would be very entertaining younger or more sensitive kids was actually pretty hard an adult (a good thing about its ability bring awareness these conditions hopefully change) beyond movie fun lot will probably totally understand they should enjoy lively imaginative characters though quest realize his dreams border collies are adorable himself favorite when lifts up snout sings heart content (la la la!) sweetly hilarious well guess do now
if you want tour child to see a movie with cute little animals in it , babe . is extremly touching and the pig one hell of actor
great disney release . happy and sad but very good one of the few children's classics
like most disney movies this one has great music and amazing animation . but the pink elephants scene cosby kids crows made it truly worth seeing
very good disney movie . dumbo ends up with huge ears is treated like an outcast and even humiliated he makes a friend in timothy the mouse told can fly if holds feather his trunk learns at end could really on own this be tear jerker taken from mother there scene where outside mothers cage she rocks him to sleep it about friendship,and pulling for each other.the cruelty that comes being different i love star loved by all.a sweet
the enduring classic tale of cute little elephant who grows up in circus , is ridiculed for his huge ears,then learns to fly.the product(even wartime)of a seemingly more innocent age,it's lost none its charm,should continue delight generations come.the baby mine sequence,when dumbo's mother gently cradles him through bars cage which she's imprisoned must surely bring lump throat most hardened cynic.for me,the endearing,lovely jewel disney crown .
tear-jerker
absolutely one of the best movies all time . can't get enough it first i saw kept watching over and for a couple days drove my sister nuts
i absolutely can never get enough of this movie . when was a kid like obsessed with it always would cry though , it's very touching !
my absolute favourite of the three . spark between harrison ford and sean connery is amazing - scenes with those two are absolutely hilarious they do seem like father son dynamic works you learn a bit more about indiana jones' past (like his real name junior dogs was indiana) get to see human side him aiming most prized item in their field holy grail , but instead getting it brings them closer leave where fantastic !
one of my favourite films as a child - it's still surprisingly original ! i liked the different personality to each animal difficulties they had face : especially river funny warm :-)
surprisingly funny! ! i watched it on tv , and had a very good time watching . splendid movie
i love the harry potter movies and books they are both great !
this the best film of harry potter series yet because emma is older and looks better there more action .
somewhat different from the book , yet main points were there . it has a director than first two movies in series so of course pacing is going to be i enjoyed was entertaining and fun watch would have liked see them do more with harry's new broom aniesty he felt while waiting for approved by school hermione's time traveling attend classes at same could been better shown but overall pretty good flick
who could not like any of the indiana jones films ? this role suits harrison ford down to ground , cheeky moody and a good sense humour - action scenes are great script is really . family film
pretty good movie i read the book but even though they left out back story about prof . lupin and snape making his potions thought it was think if put whole from into , would have been like 5 hours long above all a great
while people who love chris columbus will be hugely disapointed , i prefer the cc era loved this movie .
great movie!! ! i love harry potter movies . it dragged on a little bit , but other than that the fx were and ending was surprising
a great movie good to follow the second . in end of they found out that sirus black is innocent and real bad person who killed all those people was rons rat now if you want go see dont have because i just gave away ending
i really respect my fellow reviewers but think that because some of you love the source material so much (rowlings books) may be being unfair with this movie . when a director adapts book into he does have certain responsabilty fans is about to make his vision and not authors what chris columbus did on first two harry potters was adapt books faithfully watching rough equivalent buying one those tape recordings , if get meaning it in way too faithful also easier job than adapting prisoner azkaban only more complex juggles many subplots larger novel mr cuarn obviously had leave things behind like quidditch subplot (that miss) or reason for snapes grudge against (which opinion takes away mystery character) itself condensed compared feel rushes at times nonetheless brave re imagining potter world its characters acting better kids are no longer stiff (like they were columbuss movies) loved visual elements great theres sort aura nostalgia around liked worked emotional parts etcetera thought should judged left out from would criticising lord rings anybody who has ever read tolkiens knows peter jackson huge deal stuff original trilogy hey thats why called an adaptation people !
my entire family enjoyed the film immensely . i put it above chamber of secrets (4.5) and first harry potter flick (i rated a 4) go see asap have different perspective on movies never read syllable any j k rowlings fine books , so everything know about is from found bit slow at onset as they had to develop story for all us muggles with each subsequent we are now familiar characters enjoy tightly-wove prisoner azkaban was darker than previous albeit more compelling adult viewers there some parts that might be too intense wee ones while note complaints ria reviewers speaking non-potter readers really don't care if movie doesn't expound significance let's say why wipes his nose right sleeve instead left even though dame rowling spend 10 pages saw peter jackson try cram every minutae in lotr return king felt bogged down things check out this : 1) gary oldman's stellar performance ; 2) special effects truly awesome 3) girl plays hermoine granger keeps getting cuter she's one tarty little witch her witchy butt tight jeans displayed quite often
this little girl is a great actor . she so cute has magic powers that help her get out of bad home and school life positive attitude through all the situations was born into it very movie for kids to see
this movie is literally an insanly funny . it's such a classic , i mean you don't get more than
greatest cartoon movie ever . it makes no scence , has a caterpillar smoking hooka pipe and the mad tea party is most hilarious part of entire clean cup !
alice in wonderland is a masterpiece of an animated feature . it extremly well-done and tasteful there are some very great voice , walt had his mind on the right things at time
one of my all time favorates . simply great!! ! very innovative and funny wierd but that's what the movie's about power imagination a classic story
i'm an indiana jones fan . his epsisodes are just always so mysterious and incredible i especially like how they made history interesting the way rescues some beautiful woman
the best version of secret garden . it is hard to find a movie this quality today clean , decent film that any parent would be glad let there children see kate maberly great person and an excellent role model for
the final chapter in indiana jones trilogy . this light hearted adventure makes fun for whole family harrison ford and sean connery are great s father son heros it's action packed ! love it
this is a wonderful story for any age . john lynch as the distant lord craven was , and maggie smith maddox usual brilliant ! should be in every girls video collection
gotta love that one . yes , they are of my favourite characters this movie along with the other two aardman productions had done best claymation i've ever seen ; their countless hours on making have shown why an award winning production any person at age would appreciate we shall see if oct 7 curse wererabbit will live up to hype original three w&g movies and chicken run
the one where they went to moon was pretty corny , but other two were funny english comedies . can't wait for movie in october
an enchanting,inspired claymation oscar-winning classic from the brilliant british animator nick park.the best of marvellous adventures wallace and gromit(the immensely likeable owner dog)- this time involving a pair mechanical trousers villainous museum-robbing penguin who lodges at their home!equally appealing for adults children,and must-see anyone unfamiliar with delightful series .
i laughed cr.. . nah just till it hurt
what can i say ? aardman says it all . absolutely the best of domestic productions
this is another classic film . i think that like all indian jones trilogy , harrison ford makes the it an action thriller every american want to become a professor of archeology and go on thrilling adventures what really them good also they are series
this is a funny short movie . the claymation was great it wonderful how many things that you can do with clay especially nick park does i like gromit best and penguin drove him out of house messed electronic doggie walker trousers used them to steal diamond from museum very cute
great claymation . all three of wallace and grommit are good is an inventor the human-like dog rents a room to penguin who turns out be nasty catches on saves day original storyline even fun for adults watch
children's classic with lots of heart . every child should read the book and view movie
does it get any more classic than this ? while isn't as upbeat and cheerful disney movies , was still brilliantly done .
sad.. .
a classic story of friendship , loyalty and love . i loved it as kid...so does my own son
this film always made me cry when charlotte died after having her babies . i adored the book and was relieved that followed it so much its an absolute classic i'm going to see if can get a copy of + for have children something should not miss
i loved reading the book as a child , and now my kids adore movie . unlikely relationship between pig talking spider was quirky endearing suppose it could be metaphor for many relationships in life..however don't need to get that deep is fun touches on friendship love loss
e.b . white was an incredibly talented writer , and somehow this animated movie lives up to the great book fern rules wilbur rocks templeton is wonderful charlotte makes me swoon i want have kids just watch with them
wilbur sure was *some pig* . this classic is a must see for any age child -- and those that can understand the concepts ideas movie puts on table , there are even some wonderful moral lessons
a great movie that gets more interesting as the goes on . very and appealing little too much humor but it's still
this what a great kids film should be . the comedy is pilled on and animation fantastic fast pace of rare for disney , but they really got it right one backdrop elvis classics makes perfect hawaiian atmosphere best scene : trial at beginning
all i want to know is what stitch said make the robot start spewing parts . va la ma qwiesta!! !
a funny beautifully animated creative flim! !
aliens are certainly not my thing but this movie was so cute you didn't notice they were . for anyone with a sister or mom who's like , you'll definitely relate ! very
i loved this movie it was so cute aww nice little doggy aw u are could jsu hug poochy woochy in the toilet poo fart pee kicked but
as always , the indiana jones series are great movies . best was this last movie it had a good storyline that family sense to it(indiana and his father) is what i think gave humor made fun watch people can relate
best disney movie ever !
'lilo and stitch' was the first animated disney feature i've been to see at cinema in quite a few years now , it really hit spot ! wasn't brought life anything close acclaimed 3d eyecandy that seems be vogue but instead opted just for simple beautiful highly vivid animation i liked all better . story too is powerful dealing with some very complex issues as well managing keep you entertained every moment passes - an ammoral destructive little creature on run from intergalatic police takes refudge lonely orphaned girl two each make their own individual discoveries which carry poignent messages of importance love family even 'broken' ones soundtrack almost exclusively elvis presley sounds pleasant enough welcome variation original songs sung directly by characters best film decade (that's right it's hotter than 'the lion king') wonderful experience sit through
great movie!!!!! !
as classic a film ever there was . for musical it tackled some pretty unusual stuff , from witchcraft to invading nazis the whole cast is good and fun of all convaluted storyline that leads heroes climactic show down with stormtroopers nazi germany by way reanimated suits armor great best scene : animated soccer match
i loved the film . it was full of great actors that complimented a storyline edge your seat action and had ending to must see this is one few films can watch over again
a great companion to the book . dumb plot , but that is okay in this case as it kids movie adults can enjoy too see fonzie doing good work after all these years ! i would rate must
i loved the book when was little , and movie really did it justice . all of kids a great job acting endeared themselves to audience
it was a good movie . the acting great , and adaptation to book it's worth watching
wow ! what a good movie
i saw this movie on dvd 2 times and it's really funny , but don't reccomend watching it twice in a row .
i have an obsession with this movie!!! ! it is one of my favorite movies and as answer to person's question there's more than diggin' just happening , i'd see a movie like that
holes was an awsome movie . they had all the right people play parts is way better then book cause you can acually feel like your there expailly pats when it would flash back to older days i give this 5 stars have some sort of connection with spent my money see in theaters also rent and kept over time so pay a lot extra still havent returned if could rate more exellent luv one favorite nice job who made d-tent boys
one of my all-time favorites . i've watched it at least a dozen times harrison ford does perfect job as the adventurer archaeologist indiana jones who is in search very sacred religious artifact trouble , nazi's are after too anyway this best movies ever seen
omg how can u call it a children's bore ? ! waz an awesome movie and the actorz actressez rocked of course , best khleo thomas! :-) i mean even though (khaleed leon) thomas improved lot (he'z so hott such great actor!) would have been without him plot is really exciting it'z amazing all tiez together . had advantage because author original book (which too) wrote screenplay in acting well written
my parents always made it a point to buy brother , sister and i many of the older disney movies on tape so we could experience as they did . sleeping beauty will be favorite villain in this movie is like none else characters are amazing too what most impressed me continues now that i'm not child quality animation how you just don't get todays animated backgrounds were painted by hand only but songs still stand test time well would recommend anyone
it's beautiful!! !
walt disney's crowining glory in animation . a unique , brilliant style oscar-nominated music delightful characters--- sleeping beauty has it all
it's a beautiful movie -- probably not my favourite of the early disney movies , but near top list . evil queen is one disney's best villains more recent creations churned out at rate couple per year can't even come close to beauty and magic older ones children today are being shortchanged
this movie was a great ending to the trilogy . first because it , but i would have say that one is best
i loved the land before time when was a kid , few of sequels were okay but original will always be best . had love dinosaurs and this one did it for me
one of the few good cartoon films that isnt made by disney . does anyone remember land before time puppets they gave away at pizza hut when original came out sequels are crap , especially try to bring singing into it this though is quality
one of the best cartoons ever made .
i liked the movie because it was a great adventure ! every minute is good , especially when he finds holy grail .
funny! ! one of my favorite cartoon movies .
what i think is the best animation ever made , was not a disney-production ! land before time must only good films get that many follow-ups :o) today it's five though have seen first .
a great movie for kids and adults with lots of humor
wonderful movie based on a true story . my little scottie is very old now and i know she won't be with us much longer the ending of this so sad
not only is this a great movie for children , it's adults . i'm much of dog lover but i was very moved by story an outgoing jack russell terrier who befriends shy little boy all heart advise anyone has seen it to have plenty tissues handy grim or depressing tear-jerker
my dog skip....very umotionall made me pour out teers . its about a boy with not many friends in the 1940s during world war two his next door niehgbor is famous baseball player and he gives him tips on they are good then goes to boys (i dont remember any of names)mom for birthday without dad knowing almost has get rid because but gets keep this makes life alot better until everything wrong.....i give it five
very touching , well-wriiten well-acted and overall well-done movie . frankie muniz is a great actor i see good furure for him in acting skip was adorable ! he the son of dog that plays eddie on frasier
i really liked this movie . frankie muniz is , in my opinion a great young actor the dog was also impossible to not love :)
this one brings me back , i loved fievel as a kid was great movie .
this is by far one of the most brilliant and heart warming childrens animated films ever created . te story fival mouse how he seperated from his family while on their way to america it featuers sadest songs , somewhere out there an absolutly wonderful movie avoid goes west at all costs
i think this was the best one of series . sean connery great in it end is when he has to go through temple thing with all obstacles , and then picks right cup writing these movies so good- harrison ford man !
the muppets are never going to leave so that is why i love and always will !
the muppets take manhatten is greatest muppet movie made . it shows us that nyc a great place to go , and it's not so scary when are invading
i absolutley love this movies it's awesome entertaining and a heart-warming funny story with great characters! ! 3 cheers for the rescuers! tottaly cool!
there were several chracteristics that made this an excellent movie . first , it had a good blend of humor second the action sequences mild enough for all audiences and third language was controlled
i used to watch it over and again when was a kid . it's one of my favorites
a very fun and underrated movie . the only problem is it isn't anything like greek mytholigy but hey this funnier than history !
i loved this movie it was interesting to learn about mythlogical gods because in school i've never studied that before! ! i'm telling ya it's a fun movie!
absolutely loved this interpretation . the music was incredible and animation superb
instant classic . the film had a great cast (sean connery and harrison ford) story was very well written this will be watched for decades
i think this is the best movie have seen year . it technically brilliant (using new performance capture techniques) and beautiful visually has good action comedy provides a message , about courage belief that all not just children can take to heart eventually will be beloved christmas regarded as one of movies decade
this was the best movie i've seen in a long time . should definitely be classic my 5 yr old didn't move through entire he completely enthralled everyone see one animation is out of world ! saw incredibles & shark tale blew them water it's must
great disney release . the children might not understand some of it but it's worth viewing
my favorite fairy tale !
this movie is a beautifully animated fairy tale! ! it's one of my favorite so beautiful!!
i personally love this movie . as a child it was the first disney film watched all way through,and still today !
great movie , some extra slow people don't understand the moral behind or history it but unfortunately they can't be helped . it's a disney how realistic do you want to ? i mean common this is family not an 18+ one
this movie is great , it makes history fun! ! and keeps you entertained! what can i say love it!
absolutely marvellous , but i recognize this film can be boring for children .
very good movie . cute i love adorable movies am such a sucker for them and stuart little has got to be one of the most have ever seen
awesome movie . very cute and entertaining i loved it
i went to see this at the cinema with my friend for 19th b'day (my partner was on holiday time - sob!) and we totally loved it . best bit were definately cats wasn't too keen rest main merit film is computer graphics a few witty lines , but still think its fun nonsensical
nice movie . parents if you took your kids to see this in the theaters and they like it chirstmas is coming or haven't seen , makes a perfect
i saw this movie with my kids and they were very engaged in . it was funny light-hearted the graphics cool
i'm not exactly sure , but i think this is the one with his father . it was awesome ! extremely funny especiall when they found out that slept same woman
this movie is great for kids as well adults . the mouse an actor and character
when i was a child never liked stuart little , but took my god daughter to see this movie it seems so different . looks very realistic
stuart little has been underrated ! i rated it as great (5 stars) because it's so clever . of course for kids , but think entertaining parents and non-parents too who can resist a mouse goes with his adoptive mother to the toy store buy doll clothes family dinner ?
this was a great movie , not only for steven speilberg but harrison ford that kept him from being typecasted as the space warrior . now he plays swashbuckling archeologist and does it very well lot of adventure in holds up really
i loved the indiana jones' movies . they were all great action , adventure and funny
my favorite disney movie , along with lilo & stitch . i remember seeing it in theatres all the way back december 2001 is hilarious !
many claim beauty and the beast or snow white to be their favorite tradationally-animated disney feature . i , on other hand choose emperor's new groove certaintly able described as an atypical film this one ditches emotional plot sappy music focus out-and-out humor voice cast is quite talented but patrick warburton shines through enjoyably-inept krunk with smooth animation has snappy dialogue best comes from moments where fourth wall shattered style more movies tv shows should break play sense of reality !
it's one of those movies that has everything actually predates titanic
my second favorite animated movie , first of course in the disney robin hood version when main character(robin hood) is a fox and maid marion vixen .
i've discovered one thing about this movie for certain : people either really hate it or love . i'm of those that it's a hilarious , has pretty much good plot (even if is little off-the-wall ; ok make lot off-the-wall) and all the who do voices are wonderful at them i can think nothing to complain about...ummm...kuzco needs interest but that's stretching recommend both adults kids right in fact would probably find funnier
i love this movie . david spade , eartha kitt patrick warburton and john goodman are all the perfect choices for characters they played is funny well-paced beautifully animated very entertaining watch it !
i loved this movie it was really funny and the lama is soo cute .
harrison ford is the best .
awesome movie . outstanding vocal preformance by john goodman and david spade very funny good for all ages it was type son
i normally don't enjoy disney's politically correct view of the world , but found myself actually laughing out loud during this film . is quite possibly best disney ever made
hilarious !
this is one of the most hilarious movies i have ever seen in my entire life ! will always be favorite disney
i love this movie! ! new groove is disney's best movie in a looong time kuzco the hottest thing on two and four legs
a mesmerizing look into the lives an organized crime family through eyes of neighborhood irish/italian kid (played as adult by ray liotta) recruited at young age to perform small jobs and later rising ranks soldier racketeer . director martin scorsese's masterpiece epic features brilliant ensemble cast , (including many his group "regulars" from earlier fims including ; "mean streets" "the raging bull" "casino.") excellant soundtrack depictions graphic violence while film is laced with dark subtle humor certain scenes are not for squeemish robert dinero co-stars brutal irish-american thug jimmy conway giving powerful menacing performance paul sorvino mob boss cicero also standout lorraine brocco wife henry hill (liotta) breakout star joe pesci (winner best supporting actor role in fim) who sociopathic tommy devito steals nearly every scene that involves him murder hands be believes he moving up signals downhill slide principal characters tale itself eliminated shady world had been illuminated it's glamour allure quickly reveals massive unrepairable cracks eventually ending all players either dead or prison scorcese purposefully lures viewers this high times easy money before dropping inevitable trap door springs life eternal message "crime doesn't pay!" films like coppolla's "godfather" series nature profanity dialogue less likely create image sort "tragic hero" portayed al pacino marlon brando (and deniro) appear almost likable men whereas boys gang more ruthless killer type classic which pesci's "d" has liotta's character crapping himself confused bunch cohorts reveling nightclub ("you think i'm clown ? i amuse you what f@#k so f@#king funny?...) shows how these so-called friends can turn on each other terrified they other's presense my opinion one ten made american soil it was outright robbery named picture scorsese lost out being movie popular filmgoers students artists alike lines recite "dances wolves?" (1990's kevin costner) guess pay
if this is a true story , i'd say that it quite great to see other than cats and dogs try find their owner thatthey love so much . keep in mind parrots can live as long humans was ending paulie marie reunite after more decade of separation for the single janitor who helped parrot escape institution her happliy ever since convinced him fall with seeing movie you how touching these three coped adversity
i assume they are talking about the original . great movie loved as a kid watching them with all of animals , and when defended themselves against pirates in end
this movie is fantastic ! yes it does have an adult theme running through , but that happen with a few things and the kids don't always pick up on . they'll just see some adorable ants trying to save their colony romance occur parts are heavy parents should be able deem whether suitable for children or not personally i love film
this was a great story . not exactly g movie but it's still one for kids and adults really nice cast (sylvester stalone , christopher walken danny glover probably others as well that i didn't realize it their voice) think they should have done more with utopia since emphasized so much other than animation to see childrens isn't from disney got five stars me
i think this movie is not for children .
one of the best evah !
helloooo toast!! !
best of all time
a great surprise ! non-disney g-rated movie and its laugh riot as well . patrick stewart voices the main villian , who steals parents leaves our hero his friends marooned on earth after eating too much candy partying they go into space to save day highly recommended for all
veggie tales are precious and what a wonderful example for children .
i love veggie tales . it's the best !
the most underrated disney masterpiece ever . it's very exciting and funny plus animation is stupendous !
an early mk and a movie . pretty cute
best damn scorcese movie ever hands down .
spielberg does it again . a very entertaining story for kids and adults alike plus dustin hoffman made great captain hook !
though deadpanned by the critics , i have always thought it was underrated . a terrific family film steven spileberg once again creates magical world to immerse yourself into dustin hoffman is utterly perfect as capt hook and robin williams somehow succeeds in transforming peter pan full of color wonderful score touching story attempts tell untold whatever happened joy watch
pirates might be a little too much for young kids , but in that 8 through 12 year old range especially boys there arent many better movies .
the saddest movie i have ever seen .
wonderful movie . slightly different than regular disney , but still i would highly recommend it to kids believe was pretty faithful the roald dahl book
james and the giant peach is an extremly well done movie based on hit children's novel written by roald dahl . it's about a young boy named , whose parents are eaten hippo in sky his 2 evil aunts left to take care of him he finds that goes into makes friends with group bugs it may sound weird but this great
easily one of the best movies ever made . martin scorsese has a directing style unlike any other and this movie presents both serious laid-back look at mafia ray liotta delivers quite possibly his performance as henry hill (remember , is based on true story) goodfellas different from ganster films such godfather scarface but in very good way if you see end only will able to sum up what just saw : holy s*** !
an excellent update , which has a few additions,and is quite entertaining . lindsay lohan does exceptional job playing 2 people and the rest of cast are great musical score adds to whinsical movie was used in following year's academy awards for costume design remake from who did 'father bride'
watch as the big rock almost crushes indy ! shoots bad nepalese and saves marion truck drags through egyptian desert roads of course , 'wrath god' yaweh lightning bolts tear apart those stinking nazis to pieces i've met miserable 80 year old men who have hated every movie everything since nixon lost kennedy rant rave about this film . i love
i like it better than the gocfather , but for one reason think always miss subtle genius of godfather movies.. .
another cute movie.... . need i say more ? except that it is not as good the original..... but does finish off plot of book
aside from johnathan lipnicki's sub-par acting , this sequel is great . i still can't find the brief mild language that forced its us pg rating (in canada it rated g) but believe me a movie way families act and smacks of leave to beaver or hazel also cg voice (led by family ties star mike j fox) all around for non-human characters would have say snowbell has most lines :)
stuart little 2 was just as good and captivating the origional . i give it a thumbs up or 5 out of is awesome e.b white thinking when she wrtote book cause movie made one greatest movies ever so
this is the best movie of last year ;)
this movie is great , mixing a disney moral with well executed comedy and acting . in an almost star trek-plot the main character meets his child-self from past decides to improve life which he kind of jerk  family-friendly that comes highly recommended !
cute and irresistable movie . bruce willis makes it impossible for me not to love his acting i liked the topic , was glad saw a both kids adults
what can i say . simply the best gangster film of all time have never heard more people quoting lines from any other movie. even to this day !
this movie is heartwarming for the family . kid can act it has a nice storyline
i really enjoyed the movie , one of best i've seen this year . very funny to end with a great over all message
one of the best movies i have seen in a long time . frequently go to and find action suspense be entertaining but often mixed with violence this movie is great for all ages it made me laugh throughout whole highly recommend (and many my friends)
great adaption of the childrens classsic . soundtrack by late roger miller every mood captured in movie animation , and voiceovers
a classic disney movie , this is one of my favorites . making the characters animals was ingenious and it's written played as well most other movies time little less known compared to others but still great nonetheless
i'm a big fan of scorsese , and(f.y.i) raging bull is one me favorite movies.after godfather pt1 & pt2,goodfellas the best mob movie . what makes it great that breaksthrough genre it's overall
my dog loves this movie !
awesome movie . better than the godfather , even
halarios movie,that teeches kids not to lie . with two of my favorite acter and actress,frankie munizand amanda bines.i say it is a must see movie
this is a great movie , and very funny . frankie muniz amanda bynes are ! the blue dude cool too
i thought the jokes were funny . story line wasn't best , but still
this movie is in my personal top ten . the chemistry between robert deniro and joe pesci not unlike humphrey bogart james cagney , a perfect pairing but steals scene as ruthless gangster,as he did casino
i love this movie ; just saw it for the second time last night and was as good first . cried during both of times think is a very emotional special effects were wonderful , easy to see that lot work planning put into all ages boys girls my eight year old brother enjoyed sword fighting action scenes much rest thought actors perfect their parts they seemed know about story how should come across am sucker fantasy magic definitely right up alley seeing fairies mermaids even though somewhat darker than would imagine more temperamental (well maybe tink)!!!:)
i loved peter pan ! saw it 2 or three times
i love the free willy movies . whales , and these are great !
for anyone who gets stranded on a deserted island and always wanted to be gangster,this is the video ;flawless .
fantastic movie .
i loved everything about this movie . the animation , character and storyline was great even though thought it closely resembled land before time in its uniqueness of putting cartoon computer together awesome
this is one of scorsese's best . probably his most entertaining film
awsome plot funny,makes you crie its great
they should have more than 5 stars , it is a hundred . i love the animals take humdrum out of hollywood smut films
best mob movie i have seen !
proving that unreal isn't uncool . this very cool and funny movie focuses on animals the dogs have to save world from cats there's not only slapstick dog jokes , but nods get smart james bond other spy shows cast is great special effects in a word rock highly recommended !
great movie ! it should have been called dogs cats . are so much better , imho sean hayes was as mr tinkles
this movie is great . it's a for both in the family , ! i wanna see it again with my little brother we have beagle which why love jon lovitz how cool that?!?!?
where should i start....well this movie is just adorable!!!at 1st wasnt too sure if wanted ta c but now am very glad did! !  : ) there are famous people who take the roles of animals...for instance....there alec baldwin and charleton heston..in dogs cats enemies...the about trying to make every human in world be allergic dogs...and going have try stop them . u like movies animals talk would 4 u....it has adventure....comedy..and a tad drama it....i already want it again....it cute!go recommend that do!!!! o
people should stop whinging that this cartoon is to voilent for thier kids and it not what you would expect from an animated film . listen yourselves ! are actually slagging the off being different ie origional ok plot was most ever hit big screen , but then name feature whose predictable one of best films i've seen as too depressing - bad guys do stuff boy stops them falls in love saves day everyone happy get a grip!!
one of the greatest (if not greatest) action and thrill movies all time . how anyone can rate it less than 5 is incomprehensible ! indy into out bind after another , almost non-stop
unquestionably the greatest action/adventure film of all time . spielberg and lucas together make an unbeatable combination with great performances , solid directing story-telling a wonderful score raiders lost ark is epitome what good ole' fashioned entertainment about
great mob movie , i would put this one up with the godfather different but quality wise it's real close . deniro pesci  ray liotta were and so are supporting actors is of best movies period
this movie has got to not only the best animation i ver seen , but ive year . graphics were outstanding soundtrack funky (none of those singing characters thankyou.) it all and loved hero who saves human race couldnt ask for more
i don't know what some of these reviewers are complaining about . consider myself a discerning movie watcher , and must say that titan a.e is nearly as epic space opera star wars itself seriously ! this has it all--amazing visuals great story voice talents an awesome soundtrack to boot
i love titan a.e.!! ! and feel sorry for those suc.ers that think it suc.s . because so fuc.ing great! guess you gotta have a brain to realise how god like this movie is! it!!!!
one of the most outstanding films about mob . great performances by robert deniro , ray liotta and joe pesci
the grafics were good considering attempt for us , nice strory line and cool music . very careful with a first date though if you don't know they like cartoons it could be dangeroud otherwise
this is a funny film ! the animation perfectly melded with live-action actors . jokes are great and come in all forms--movie references , classic looney tunes slapstick even moments that break fourth wall steve martin particularly notable as head of acme starting bang never slowing down movie simply fun
just great
my kids are 4 and 5 were so excited to see this movie (after seeing countless trailers on nickelodeon) . i wasn't quite sure if it was for them (the pg rating) however , we watched together everyone enjoyed ! is a great family that parents children can both enjoy there humor action neat gizmos plenty of kid power keep entertained the acting effects entertaining plot fun you watch with or without
we loved spy kids ! it was funny , fast-paced and full of creative gadgetry . in our group were people aged 4 6 35 62 all
spy kids was a great family movie , i would call it james bond junior . most of the movies we end up taking our to have little or no parent entertainment value for had good mixture effects plot action suspense and humor keep parents involved did not jump go bathroom even once now that says lot
we loved seeing this movie today . my 9 year old twins , 11 daughter 14 son and myself was a lot of fun i am such fan antonio banderas the only thing that bugged me (not kids) they forgot to wrap up at ending rescue people whole about rescuing ! oops but otherwise it i've never seen with so many gadgets
lovely movie talented jim henson and that nice looking david bowie . my favrorite jenniffer connnelly i can watch this over agan it so interesting
okay , the only way not to like this movie was if you don't speak english . shark tale's directors' aim create a hilarious (which i think one and with aside from teaching kids some valuable lessons which is kinda obvious u gotta be real dumb try hold it against cuz its f***ing what do suppose should in bloodbath? ? hint nudge seraph) definitely succeeded but thought best about cast mean robert deniro brilliant addition so angelina jolie will smith just being himself turned out fine laughed my ass off on worth time for ending apparently created purpose singing everything again children children's crying loud how can ppl here's an alternative : lenny suddenly quits vegetarian eats everyone im sure ur would love that or oscar keeps living lie never gets busted learn alot lino turns gay sodomizes including have been original doubt politically correct long story short really funny while could done differently satisfied thats big yes watching
it was like an animated car wash meets sopranos . tons of laughs and lessons for the kids i thoroughly enjoyed
a top five movie of all time !
i love the dog with no spots oddball she was a cute . it good but wonder how owner got dipstick you know little doggie from 1st one
can't help it , loved this movie and would watch again . i truly appreciate the moose being from canada really appreciating bob doug mackenzie's homour added to great stuff !
i absolutely loved this movie . a great story about caring for another also found myself laughing alot throughout the whole thing like when kenai first gets his totem bear of love ? ...does anyone wanna trade x) really don't see what people i'm huge lion king fanatic , yet say that it was pathetic attempt to be next tlk it's got an outstanding soundtrack (i had go buy right away after theater release) cute characters beatiful plotline - just amazing couldn't help but cry at end because so sweet and if you know talking suggest rent dvd ^^
full of memorable scenes and characters . peschi especially
this movie , when compared to pocahontas is less offensive and does show what american indians believe in their stories they tell . truly the animal characters are cute ; surely a fine watch one who feels sympathy after taking life away from momma bear learning how it while care of orphan though did not win an oscar (finding nemo won for best animated film) great that got listed as nominee (see disney's masterpiece movies weblists similar comment on movie.)
c'mon . see it with your kids i did they laughed all the way through and must say , was contagious for those complaining about wasting their 7 bucks or walking out of theatre...i hope you have a miserable time camping waiting new star wars movie to open buncha goofy goobers! !
a fantastic movie from start to finish ! was the first time i ever saw acting of both ray liotta and lorraine bracco they were superb great story really . it's one those movies have taped can watch over enjoy it each time!
im a gooffy goober yeah ! your werw all goofie goobers . after seeing that movie i cant get song out of my head anyway this rocks!!! the rock rocks!! spongebob love him him!!! and right now i'm acting very crazy so gonna sop writing review
if you were a child in the late 80's to early 90's or even parent at time , probably appreciate this film . sure it's corny and bit dated now but such harmless fun amusing quite witty for cold-blooded creatures turtles will live on hearts forever
if you grew up in the late 80's early 90's , then have to love this one . ninja turtles were coolest and anything having do with them was awesome
this is a wonderful movie for children my nephew loves it and......so do i !
i still watch this movie . it's alot better than 2 or 3 in my books is even spider-man !
cowabunga!!!! ! one of the greatest films from my youth . i will stand by turtles till day die love being a turtle!!!!!
awesome movie . i have loved since was a mere babe the whole concept of warrior turtles is just incredible
probably my favorite movie of all time . scorsese captures the personalities that era/lifestyle flawlessly every word in dialogue and song on soundtrack are so carefully hand-picked...this is one those few movies simply won't get old i plain-and-simple can not watch scene where pesci critiques his mom's artwork without cracking up laughing ( love it dog goes way , another other guy back he's sayin' 'what you want from me?' )
i must have been about 9 when this came out in the uk . my parents , sisters cousins and aunts went to see - general vote was that it fantastic !
the best gangster movie of all time--better than godfather . it's not so much a story , but rather an extremely entertaining collection classic scenes one those rare films that you love more every time see it superb use oldies music goodfellas really engages from start and takes on heckuva ride maybe his (raging bull is) definitely scorsese's most
fat albert was pretty good it is a fun movie to watch .
totally moving and funny . it's great to get in touch with old school times while watching this update : i don't want trash talk d j , but you haven't seen closely the asthetics of movie i'm a fan fat al general loved show since had cable it was on usa network 1980's any him bill cosby will somehow see based his shows
i love these 3 movies . there so awesome ! hockey and own all of them besides , josh jackson is in need say more ?
it is the best movie ever . when came out on vhs i got because and that has a new rugrat in (dill) with dill t.v show or moive would not be as good now love rugrats so much
this is my favorite movie of all time . i've read the book too (called wise guys ) , and are equally superb robert deniro portrays jimmy gent beautifully (of course would you expect any less from deniro?) he has a certain charisma that will never be possessed by other actor...it's undescribable ray liotta did an excellent job portraying henry hill..i love his cool calm demeanor through out (except when goes into panic mode toward end) another great joe pesci goodfellas best performance guy can portray member mobb then go on to play crook in kids (home alone) deserves credit part ? scene with billy batts moral : don't bang trunk most tantalizing ever ! definatley classic
a great movie to be enjoyed by all rugrats fans
great
great movie ! it got excellent reviews , but did not do so well in theaters . still rocks thought
bearing in mind this was supposed to be a family movie , i thought it rather good . there were definetly spots that could have used some pepping up but overall quite enjoyed the story is predictable then what kids isn't ? robin williams schtick (as people keep calling it) livened things bit myself highly recommended though you may want rent
one of the best movies ever !
i always thought judy was good looking . think that this movie mainly about so that's since she is my favorite do however like the one where they meet flintstones too !
this movie is absolutely my favorite gangster . it's a great storyteller that doesn't lose you at all 2 1/2 hour even feel like one because it keeps in so much suspense i love every actor played vital role
the most entertaining of all martin scorsese's film and a candidate for best nineties . it's just so fun to watch paukie , jimmy henry especially tommy do their thing ! in every single shot you can clearly see scorsese recalling his childhood days sitting front movie screen watching gangster movies goodfellas is masterpiece
at first i thought it was just a kids ecscuse for an action movie but very good . its about tenage boy named cody banks(frankie muniz great)who allways gets nervous and stuters around girls he had gone to summer camp where they trained teens work undercover with the csi.in his profile is great so mission get close girl could find out her dads secret project dad being forced make insects eat everything steel humans ect bad guy plan freeze them into ice cubes because if there not frozen would see send csi when melt destroy base meanwhile begins like girl(hilarie duff).i wont give away any more of
this movie was better than the first . animation is good and there are new characters in secenes paris look realistic go rent it
scorstassy hits the spot again(even though i spelled his name wrong) . this movie is cool , gangsters are lovable and hateable very twisted love it
i loved this movie! ! the soundtrack was great . movie is for whole family
this movie was great!! ! i think everyone should go see it!!!!! it cute with kid and adult humor so while the kids are laughing at angelica falling in mud , adults didi yelling stew for losing definately a perfect family!!
my all-time favorite kids movie .
aside for the nostalgia timeless disney characters and stunning animation , there was some great humor present as well . i loved fantasia reference mickey cracked when he said it would take a sorceror to clean up this mess ! wise-cracking reindeer are always funny donald's destructive rampages oh santa claus line let's see tooth fairy do that after landing on roof of house reminded me my stories where teamed course were good messages no objectionable content
astonishing movie , from the virtuostic direction and film editing to brilliant ensemble cast . my only (minor) complaints are about soundtrack first off it is a little too relentless pop songs nonstop secondly for most of music parallels setting but towards end era that being depicted mismatch still scorcese as good taxi driver maybe better
very short but not so bad , really cool
fine film .
one of the very best ganster films ever made . totally watchable , superb direction from scorsese first class acting all round especially de niro and joe pesci brilliant music editing
scorsese is a genius ! pechi and liota steal the show
the best of all-time !
yugioh rocks man ! anyone who likes is a friend of mine
new york minute was great ! it is different than their other movies and really cute . about two sisters finding where relationship they end up helping each out a movie that teaches lesson
i loved the show that movie was based on and never dreamed any one would do alive action version . well they did effects are very nice story is a little week concentrates kids to much bill paxton anthony edwards make their money easy as does ben kingsly you have look at film incontext , it 1960s kid which great for its time original producers creators where left out of project think could done lot better but good effort family fun watch everyone unfortunatly critics beating up alot people will not see if get late don't worry begining credits horrible
another superb pokemon motion picture , this one has it all . great action slick animation good humor and even cool music the plot involves a little girl unleashing psychic energy of mysterious unown she imagines legendary entei as her father meanwhile our heroes are proceeding through town where is happening...team rocket some lines they break fourth wall with style course you have brock hitting on girls finally smoother than early episodes especially during battle sequences
an exciting adventure involving time travel and pokemon turned evil , it is upbeat colorful movie . also the ending great so music
the best ! i just cannot believe that amazon or other like stores , do not have this movie in dvd format!! superb acting wonderful amd intriguing storyline you get any better sad thing is they make movies did .
this movie sucked so bad that i have no choice but to give it 5 stars .
simply incredible !!! ! you are glued to the screen , very dark gothic and fast-moving never bored . evil housekeeper will send chills down your spine!
goodfellas is one of my favorites because joe pesci . his character along with all the characters drew me into plot mofia movies have always intruiged this movie did that
great movie , performance by fontaine photography mood music and an all-around cast . the only hitchcock film to win best picture
this is a perfect picture . if ever there was cast , it in film they make the come alive david o selnick which my opinion his greatest acheivement and alfred hitchcock's american directorial debut an auspicious one ! joan fontaine deserved best actress oscar for her performance as second mrs dewinter did judith anderson supporting danvers
one of hitchcock's best . this won picture the year it came out joan fontaine plays woman who marries laurence olivier , a man was once married to lady named rebecca is constantly haunted by many reminders in mansion called mandalay judith anderson awesome as miss danvers housemaid adored late (she later became dame and actually portrayed vulcan high priestess star trek iii : search for spock)
you must see this beautiful movie . don't believe it is an hitchcock one , because in fact was a selznick production but quite faithful to the original book by daphn du maurier and mystery delicately exposed our eyes  with wonderful olivier fontaine miss !
one of the most beloved movies our time , and rightly so . growing up i always anticipated an airing wizard oz on tv what a treat it was to be taken escape from real world apart something fantastic beautiful its sometimes hard for me think that shirley temple actually considered first foremost film as dorthy is supposed just child doubt movie would classic today without garlands brilliance amazing voice somewhere over rainbow strikes cord all whom listen probably single definitive score in cinema history tale 4 wayword souls journey become "complete" find along way they didnt need anything prove their worth inside them dorothy finds through lifes struggles matters end are those we love us indeed there no place like home'
a movie so good that it continues to grow an audience with each new generation is exposed . ensemble cast brilliantly played characters and unforgettable soundtrack the message of film , "there's no place like home." one resonates inside hearts all who are fortunate enough enjoy love home friends family world over think they nearly left judy garland's emotionally charged rendition 'somewhere rainbow' on cutting room floor makes you thankful for occurences devine intervention true classic times
there is so much tosee in this , just seeing once isn't enough . i have seen it more times than care to count but every now and then see something missed before we all know where the yellow brick road goes wonder about that red starts circle with does go ?
the goofiness and silliness of characters gives movie its own beauty .
goodfella's is one of my favorite movies . it well writeen and acted by robert diniro joe pesci a classic gangster movie that everyone should see
i think it is a great film to watch with children . they will love the silly scarecrow , funny lion and girls want red sparkly shoes so can click back of their heels say "there no place like home." pretend be wicked witch west other siblings by saying in scary tone "i get you my pretty." sing skip tunes were off see wizard wonderful oz... follow yellow brick road. etc if for first time as an adult might not enjoy much someone that has seen child have friend saw he said wished would this movie when was kid really liked tornado certain amount mystery because do know what happen sucked up
my favorite movie of all time !
also being one of the very first movies in color , this movie is a true classic that has an unmatched storyline people will cherish for generations .
definatly a classic , don't listen to the people who say its just kids movie . although it is in fact for so timeless that no matter what age group aimed at everyone will enjoy
i never missed the wizard of oz when it on ever since was a child . even became teenager id tell my friends got in trouble and had to go home but really cuz didnt miss movie reputation uphold this is that should forever be passed down generartions
this movie is sheer perfection without all the computer generated special effects of today . it a classic
one of the best modern gangster films all time . joe pesci in his roles , with classic scene funny how ! rise and fall big-time small criminals no family backing them plus youthful shots ray liota's character beginning film are a nice touch
this movie is definitely a classic . here it 2005 and children still get exited watching
one of the few times i actually agree with louie . this mocie is a masterpiece and personally believe that it best movie all time watch at least once year could never ever grow tired ,
a masterpiece , an unforgetable film for the ages.i will never forget first time i saw it as kid.update:anyone who does not rate this 5 simply know what they are talking about .
i have seen this movie so many times , am quite sure know the entire dialog by heart . it was one of those magical movies that around before you were born and just became part your childhood watching with my mother is best memories her
probably the greatest movie of all-time , doesn't get better than this !
real classics never die . wonder why they only play it during the holidays though
how can anyone not like this movie ? first let me state that if type of were released today i would be hesitant to see it because i'm into musicals per se ; my tastes range from witty comedies supense action movies . being said , have acknowledge the greatness since is ingrained (and everyone's) memory and always enjoy seeing just wish presented on television as an event once a year in old days (it was shown or around easter time nbc when kid) 30 times day tbs tnt july 4th anyway you seen there something wrong with
probably hollywood's greatest film . it has great songs , good action and humor the transition from black & white kansas to full-color oz is brilliant cinematography
whoever rated this low is obviously in denial.. . c'mon , did you honesly not love epic as a kid?? ? i know sure and just turned 24 today!! ! (10-02-80) whenever grew up watched movie at least dozen times never got sick of it will after the house drops.. tornado she emerges inside colorful oz that most beautiful thing ever witnessed on t.v great!!
i liked it a lot . nothing else to say good all around
this is a great movie . here something to do with oz on the third lions roar mgm logo , start album dark side of moon by pink floyd if you timed it right when miss gulch riding her bike gale farm bunch clocks should be chiming song money goes color just listen words in while watching and i think will enjoy
this is one of those classical movies that unfortunately will never die . for a film its time (1939) the wizard oz boasts magnificent scenery , costumes script colourful characters and memorable songs most popular holiday films like it or not people to remember many generations after original release date are already speaking volumes how truly
one of the best movies ever made and it is great family to watch . when i was a kid , had always anticipated event during thanksgiving time knew that for wizard oz story absoultely beautiful talent judy garland surpreme singing acting costumes were sight see just overjoyed by all very creative start in black&white then go color end with each charceter intersting scarecrow tin man lion amazing especially they together my favorite line witch melting aways how can girl like destroy wickedness ! what movie
a wonderful fantasy , but very few people know about the political allegory intended by l . frank baum who wrote book in era of populism and 1890s story is quest for free silver with dorothy representing kansas (the root populist movement) ; scarecrow brainless agricultural midwest tin woodman heartless industrial north cowardly lion was william jennings bryan witches represent different regions their competition either helpful to cause (north vs south post civil war) or destructive (west east) yellow brick road (gold) leads emerald city which course thousand apologies not saying what winged monkeys you should be able guess this after all pc
it has judy and the land of oz .
as you can tell , this is one of my very favorite movies all time . toto was the perfect star and knew everything would be ok along judy garland at her best !
this is one of the greatest movies all time.as a child it has everything you want in movie ; flying monkeys , witches,talking animalsetc . also songs somewhere over rainbow.this film appeals to age groups
this is the best mob movie ever . joe pesci , robert deniro and ray liotta give great performances
one of the best !
truely a clasic! !
i absolutely adore this movie . the perfect family film
a good imaginative movie.dorothy gets caught up in tornado and ends new land where she meets munchkins. , bad witch glinda the scarecrow tinman cowardly lion along with her found friends toto go off to meet wizard so he can send home . they have deal way there are some songs this movie especially somewhere over rainbow one of most famous ever wonderful fairy tale judy garland is perfect as dorothy gale.all actors good.we still like watch every now then.one best fantasy movies
a wonderful cast , great story songs everything is aaaa++++ . this show will live forever
very great classic movie . judy garland is a actress this will be around for long time
i've always loved this movie . when i was a kid it would play once year on channel 10 the only night we were allowed to eat in living room
toto is the real star of this show and so talented smart . love whole thing : stars , songs story
the big daddy of all family films . a wonderful fantasy about dorothy getting whisked off to oz and meeting up with many memorable characters you could see this hundred times not get tired
it was almost as good the godfather , but not quite . dialogue and acting movie is based on a true story
loved it seen many times since i first saw and plan to see again
one of the greatest films all time . so entrenched in our society that we forget it's a movie but it is , an important to and culture also dark side moon goes along with that's awesome
greatest film of all time , starring the actress .
this is one oif the most amazing films ever made . a true cinematic tour de force can watch film with sense of wonder throughout all facets their life as kid you for magic and cartoonish horror , later an adult it while high or drunk(i prefer drunk) feeling same in fact i believe that wizard oz was created by seedy 1930's hollywood drug abusers personal enhancement
there has been no greater story told than this one , and more beautiful or talented actress lived judy garland . i know we're not supposed to comment on other people's comments but damn if lord of the waves honestly believes that person did any kind drugs because they saw wizard oz  he/she needs real help
still as great it was so many years ago . magical , brilliant frightening essential are just some of the words that could describe this film has inspired much and those winged monkeys way witch melts black-and-white beginning it's timeless summary : a
fantastic adventure ! classic story told very well in this movie . highly recommmend
i have heard that the wizard of oz is most watched american movie ever made . it , indeed an excellent and can understand why has earned such a reputation appeals to sensibility everyone basically probably greatest family film remember watching this when was younger while not one my top favorites extremely entertaining deserves every bit praise gotten
goodfellas is full of action and violence which i really enjoy watching . the cast was good had robert deniro joe pesci , who are actors movie about mob that interesting
the best movie of all time !
greatest family film .
no other film defines cinematic splendor and magical possibilities quite like the wizard of oz  . whatever all necessary elements are - i am sure many would give their eyeteeth to be capable completely defining them rarely do they come together as distinctly did in this case with just right cast , story enchantment make it timeless ! never-ending success is one those extraordinary things you cannot plan duplicate or mimic since its release 1939 has been source wonderful childhood memories loved by several generations message simple there place home people who love that point alone makes easy see wide-range lasting appeal
great fantasy story ! there are very few fantasies out that come close to the sense of awe and wonder this film projects . e.t is only one comes mind add fact it has been branded onto our culture in same vein as films like gone with wind , casablanca psycho others performances excellent visuals interesting situations some songs all adds up
one of the best 'suspend your disbelief and enjoy it' movies ever to come about ! dorothy is sweet , wicked witch a classic inherent in all childrens nightmares dorothy's friends convey loyalty we hunger for our .
this is definately the best action/adventure film of all time . speilburg and lucas are a great when teamed up harrison ford at his probably my favorite movie i love scene where indy chases truck rams nazis off road
i thought that goodfellas was a great movie with cast . it as good the book , lots of action and little comedy they also did job portraying mob
i watched this movie as an annual event until was into my 30's . it's timeless bought the dvd so 4 year old granddaughter can enjoy it possibly greatest of all time
the perfect movie . try to see it in a theatre and reactions of other people i've done this few times unconsciously singing along recitng dialogue , children staring amazement film is over 60 years old ! current so-called family movies (especially disney tripe) with all their computer effects stereo what have you can't hold candle wizard once year ? i could watch every day
i love this movie , it's great . my all time favorite next to gone with the wind whoever gave a rating of one star must have had sad neglected childhood and feel sorry for them
a true classic!! ! great songs , characters story . nice good guy/bad guys classic and revolutionary in its time
ok , yeah i know wizard of oz but hey it's good . the music colors scenery costumes and overall story is all really well done it helped to bring my creativity out more in writing acting great movie everything !
unforgettably perfect movie . deep meanings in a sweet fantasy story wonderful characters i can watch it million times and never tire of
great movie . pesci is a straight badass this can never get old
a great movie , i love it . it's just fun especially when turns from black and white to color
i love this movie . now my kids there is nothing like wonderful escape into a world of fantasy where the good ones come out victors sadly , only realized in recent years that scarecrow tinman and lion are same people as those on farm (i can be bit slow sometimes) great tale friendship determination realization
judy garland makes this movie exceptional with her excellent voice . i love it when the witch of west dies
a classic and trippy film . whether watched along with dark side of the moon or not , this movie rules every time flying monkees scene will always send chills down your spine no matter how many times you have seen it
simply wonderful , gets better every decade  !
the most magical movie ever made , and this was in 1939 !! ! puts todays computerized movies to shame
wizard of oz has great music . it appeals to childhood fantasy the actors are too characters fun
you can't view this movie without being aghast at how much of our vocabulary comes from it . the whole thing has permeated popular culture like no other movie.. a permanent classic
without this movie , i don't think would have had a healthy childhood .
for the time it was made , wizard of oz is an amazing film full imagination and far before its .
boy did that last entry miss the point ! stay away from "the adventures of huckleberry finn" there kid , you may fall off raft and drown looking for meaning behind twain's words . in this spot-on retelling harper lee's diatribe against prejudice racial intolerance gregory peck (as atticus finch) gives one most memorable screen performances cinematic history his lincolnesque portrayal man's fight tyranny injustice is still required viewing highschool sociology classes across country message both movie book stand as powerful today they those pre-civil rights days their initial release little girl plays scout who her brother well visiting friend dil (modeled after boyhood truman capote) are also noteworthy it through children's eyes (and scout's particular) story related we learn along with them share fears unknown more terrifying known elements shape world grown-ups live around use black white film helps to bring life a time when people saw just way were loathe step out shadows if by being exposed light true reflection person be shown murky darkness truth lie dormant but children can seen kids turn adults look into themselves acceptance finally succeeds drawing mysterious boo radley (played robert duvall) self-imprisonment back community hold keys better future armed lessons observation experience sage teachings lawyer finch will realized
still a terrific watchable b+w movie . get load of (very) young robert duvall ! gregory peck is  .film does the book justice
another great movie . i really like these kind of movies , the mafioso how they showed very little detail his life he became one goodfellas and got out plus it's a real story
excellent movie . takes place in the south during depression seen through eyes of children a lawyer.gregory peck is wonderful as atticus , decent man who defends black wrongly accused raping white woman well done acted by all
this will always be a favorite of mine . gregory peck did an outstanding job in the lead role
great leading role . poignant social issues even today
'to kill a mockingbird' is definitely one of the greatest books . on par movie version , and who can deny 'mockingbird's' place as movies all-time ? conveys deep message : that ugliness racial prejudice hurts not only victim but an entire society for all viewers there are poignant lessons to point out about value true friendship understanding selfless sacrifice help our fellow man- regardless irrespective color one's skin this simply masterpiece whose timelessness will continue inspire others years come it forever touch those watch
heartwarming!a feel good movie.gregory peck does a masterful job in this film.i cannot believe it is rated low .
brilliant
the best mob movie i have ever seen . ray liotta , robert deniro and joe pesci are one of acting trios thought those three had most realistic portrayal mobsters
this is one of my favorite movies . the portrayal innocence by scout and her coming to terms with ways world well done gregory peck perfect as father , atticus finch a lawyer who stands up for what's right even though whole town against him it highly inspiring story !
this was a great movie . i had to watch it in high school and remember going oh my god is gonna suck am glad watched gregory peck one of the best
this was an excellent movie . gregory peck in one of his finest roles as atticus finch i love the characters scout , jem and dill they were typical kids growing up south during time portrayed kept you interested scenes that left anticipating next moment loved robert duvall part boo radley will always be best classic don't make them like anymore
i loved the book and movie was just as good
i love this book and movie so much . my favorite part of both has to be everything with boo radly find that because am around jems age , 14 can relate how myseterious things are kids think everyone also had somthing like in there childhood it is the best ever they should rellay consider these more doesnt have a lot action but need seeing robert duvall as radley was exciting enough!! !
great book , movie . the cast is superb especially gregory peck
there are few examples of a great book being turned into greater movie , but i think this is one . atticus finch rules! ! tom robinson the bomb scout and jem best tear up like baby when says hey boo at end man what
this is one of the best movies ever made . it's so hard to pick a favorite scene , but if i just had to...it would be on steps jailhouse when scout brought that lynch mob back reality as only child could have done kids roles (scout jem and dill) were outstanding they took me simpler time all you needed was an old mop suddenly fastest horse in neighborhood gregory peck's finest work no else atticus life way peck did brock peters portrayal tom robinson astounding say least (can't go busting up any ole body's chifferobe) who forget eeriness with which robert duvall portrayed boo radley movie makes feel though there don't make em like anymore
excellent story line . really strong plot and symbolism expressed in the harper lee's work along with gregory peck's acting make it a movie definitely worth seeing
a great book because it keeps your interest all the way through (kinda' like not having to put down book) . deals with society's views about race and discrimination from child's point of view
if every man were like atticus finch,the world would be a much better place .
one of america's classic film offerings . this is delightful you need to watch because : 1) it a 2) hollywood , et.al do not make films like anymore 3) the greatest actors gregory peck stars in 4) who could forget kid named scout ? 5) learn little about racist south and how contact with blacks created controversy
one of the finest movies made . true to book acting is superb by all
the acting and plot were great .
i haven't seen this movie for awhile , but remember it as one of the few movies that has ever gotten me to cry . a father great with morals who risked all help another was really touching and well love
this was one of the best movies i have ever seen! ! it had all elements a good movie : plot , nostalgia political issues suspense . is that will definitely want to view again after children
to kill a monkingbird was great movie . it stuck pretty close the novel based on blended characters from book and totally left out one but otherwise focusing problems of time
this is a well made movie . acted filmed and great story to start with i think it should be used as teaching tool for would film makers maybe we have lot less garbage being
to kill a mockingbird is one of my favorite movies all time.. . it reminds me childhood i always wanted dad like attials
this is another john ford work . the story takes place in a welsh mining town and of large family's interactions welshmen singing cym rhondda fantastic it fun to compare that hymn here with same african queen donald crisp plays patriarch family coal miners , moving account won well-deserved oscar
crisp dialogue , strong performances by everybody (leads supporting cast and bit players) competent direction . worth seeing a few times the sequels are nothing special however
the first of dashiell hammett's thin man stories to be shown on screen . this one is best and it won't disappoint any classic movie fan stars william powell myrna loy as nick nora charles he used a detective she his wealthy wife they spend most time inembriated , soused very funny asked by young woman help her when father becomes top suspect in murder case are delight watch have excellent chemistry together
i never get tired of watching this movie . utterly fascinating to see how women haven;t changed that much over the decades georgous costumes , funny dialogue sheer delight immerse yourself in
one of the best from 90's . liota and deniro are great i have rarely seen a soundtrack compliment movie this well
the women is a "shearer" delight . wonderful story all about men , without single man in film ! rivals joan crawford ( who best character this bar none ) and norma sheerer bit annoying as she very naive star one of thee comedies classic history it's interesting to see these two ladies work together joan's first movie role was play norma's stand an early treated though should be graetful even had part her big then apparently quite head well its funny that replace just few years mgm's biggest box office draw wonder what thought ? anyways get back point wonderfully witty acted 1930's film'
"the women" reeks of caricature and female bashing (the author the stage play on which it is based was clare booth luce) very funny highly enteraining . come to think , men aren't portrayed too well either gimmick there are no in cast just mentioned constanly by all characters joan crawford paulette goddard do real well...but norma shearer plays such a self sacrificing noble goody two shooes wimp per most film that you want smack her across head. mary boland imo steals movie as countess
norma
the perfect christmas movie . if you have really young kids , i don't think they'd enjoy it because is long and in depth but love i'm 16
a great film to watch every christmas !
best christmas movie of all time , hands down . jimmy stewart was brilliant !
this movie stands the test of time with human emotion spanning many decades awesome
what's not to like about it's a wonderful life ?
joe pesci plays tommy in this movie . another gangster featuring killing people , drug abuse and family war great for all the gang bangers out there
i have loved this movie since can remember , and it is still a holiday tradition at our home .
this is not the best film ever created but gets 5 stars for many other reasons..this movie a tradition that has always left me with comforting sense its' small town goodness . i sensed those were better times when vitues and family mattered...teaches some very good moral lessons too
wonderful acting , great story and a moral message.jimmy stewart is unforgetable!one of my top 10 all time !
directed by frank capra , it's a wonderful life (1946) is one of the few if not sole dark films that considered christmas movie . for uninitiated story revolves around george bailey (james stewart) who finds himself considering suicide notwithstanding his numerous selfless acts has helped family friends and hometown savior angel clarence (henry travers) shows what town would have been like he had never born through process discovers seemingly inconsequential was important after all core cast includes donna reed as george's supporting wife lionel barrymore evil mr potter wants to control despite film being recognized academy commercial success in fact did become wildly known until copyright allowed lapse entered public domain shown repeatedly during holidays bottom line an american classic illustrates both dream its challenges
this is a true classic that i have pased on to my children . at 30 , 33 and 36 they still watch show as tradition of their childhood oldest even discusses in his literature class he teaches middleschool
if there was a rating higher than 5 , i would give it . people need to look past the mistaken idea that this is christmas movie and see can be viewed all through year...and with every viewing you get something new just grabs your heart james stewart as far am concerned greatest actor hollywood has produced he sheer brilliance in watch him fall apart what happens many dire straits live when realizes how blessed share joy too think of movies mr did one will remembered for 100 years from now they still remarking on film performances while by best thing about not say others were less wonderful whole cast astoundingly fabulous my favorite made after returned service wwii everything lived during war mature jimmy we loved george bailey even more wish time realized quality glad do
this is one of my top 5 all time favorite movies . i love anything and everything regarding the mob movie gives me a big dose mobsters don't know if it as much fascination acting great has lot names like robert deniro , joe pesci ray leota goes through long period characters really develop throughout film
true holiday classic . it does seem a little old fashioned compared to today's films , but that's also part of its charm
this movie didn't hit me till well into my 30s . it really got to last xmas when george is ready off himself , and he sees life without him that always brings a tear stewart did hell of job in one even the love story rang true i his transformation from optimist cynic again speaks all us very american but also cinema classic
best holiday movie ever! ! one of the few movies that gets me choked up at end!
definitely an all-time classic . one of the best 40's , and frank capra's masterpiece
great lines : pox upon me for the oaf that i am  , hee-haw theme an opportunity to examine impact one's life makes on others . cast quintessential jimmy stewart (made a life-long fan) demure and tantalizing (naked in bushes scene) donna reed introspection when young george has loving maturity understand mr gower's grief over loss of his son withstanding verbal physical barrage prevent what could have been fatally errant prescription belated awareness subsequent thankfulness scenes rush bank mary sacrificing their honeymoon nestegg save it clarnece ordering long past due drink at martini's bert ernie...alive well hearts our children sesame street.. course you get this is easily all-time top 5 my favorite movies never ceases choke up always little yesteryear
it's a wonderful movie !
the coolest movie ever!! ! for christmas anyways
a film that consistently brings tears to my eyes . frank capra's masterpiece of ethics , the american dream and george bailey's search for fame discovery man doesn't have be wealthy richest in town is an classic has become such part our lives christmas without this like bacon eggs includes performance defines jimmy stewart's unparalleled movie career some most memorable scenes history lionel barrymore as mr been boil on neck 20 years potter see it every year
in my opinion this movie excedes , by far the godfather when it comes to portraying mafia a realistic way . there is no sugar-coating found here joe pesci perfect as half crazy risk taking murderer who can still make you laugh lorraine bracco robert de niro and ray liota are all top form well
anyone who isn't touched by this movie would have made a great mr . potter , without even acting
when small-town denizen george bailey (james stewart) wishes out loud that he'd never been born , his guardian angel clarence (henry travers) shows him how idyllic home town of bedford falls would have without . this perennial christman classic works so well because it plumbs the very depths despair before pulling all emotional stops for desperately happy ending ( i knew had many friends wails george) is a beautiful and heartwarming tale an absolute must-see summary : brilliant christmas
after watching this movies we should come away with a deeper appreciation of life , our own . what if had never been born so things don't always go the way planned isn't really about those love and who us in return.this movie journeys from depths despair to realization is important ones
this is my all time favorite movie . it about priorities and what really matters in life may seem to start off a little slow , but of the things at beginning are leading up something worthwhile that made james stewart actor frank capra director warm funny has good moral true classic closest thing perfect there
before watching this i had the same mis-conceptions as everyone else about films from golden age and especially festive flick . film fortunately put such doubts to rest many will argue it is too sentimental , while partly true scenes are handled with utmost care never feel corny being current generation of cynical drones me was a revelation capra fills each scene aplomb that one cannot help but slightly moved has perfect cast immortal jimmy stewart absolutely gorgeous donna reed (underrated underrated) labelled good christmas movie label disrespectful encompasses variety values emotions family faith hope love aspirations despair others although universal there some lighthearted also long periods darkness depression (exploiting talent perfectly) if happy then most depressing have ever seen every excellently realised by director at pinacle his craft furnished layers detail feeling complemented best assembled (yep beating all think in my opinion) performance refreshing unlike 99% other (where acting wooden dated) dialogue wonderfully accomplished not dated least polls do consider be greatest after something 'cool' for 'twenty generation' like godfather or pulp fiction effortless surpasses previous favourites : shawshank redemption magnolia truman show se7en memento these excellent touch personally way it's wonderful life they ignite sense joy 'magic' cinematic utopia which breaks free boundaries motion entertainment into realms little red muscle your chest feels nice
a timeless classic
i watched this movie at a time in my life when was feeling very down . moved to michigan away from family new york and lonely because couldn't be with them christmas felt so good after watching it that called mom discuss
this is not just a christmas story , it's message universal : that persistence and faith can overcome despair . it thoroughly heartwarming movie go back to again again..
a magnificent picture !
i recently saw this again on tv and had forgotten how great film was . even though a lot of it cut out due to profanity , reminded me that need rent soon in terms mob movies one ranks just hair below godfather ii joe pesci at his psychotic comedic best performance provides enough reason by itself see the movie's climactic scene is shot superbly i've never done cocaine but after watching have pretty good idea would feel
this is one of my favorite movies all time . our family watches every year at christmas.a tradition for us.i love the story a man who has always given up his dreams to help others he goes through crisis and thinks about ending life  down comes clarence angel.he shows george what would have been like if had never born.george finds how important those around him decides wants live very last scene where town rallies still tearjerker i feel good james stewart perfect as bailey.the other actors are fine too
in my opinion , this is about the tenth greatest movie eleven months out of year . but during december it number one !
it's a wonderful life is real classic , and it good lesson for anyone to learn who feels useless that his or her has little no meaning . people feel discouraged with can take look at their think back all the come  there most likely are could not have done without you how one person's affect lives of those around him in positive way as far mr.potter goes,in negative so really appreciate movie like this help find
one of the very best . i watch it almost every year and never seem to get tired its hopeful message
a true classic ! one of the best x-mas stories ever . very interesting and eye-opening i think its about time they make new though , just to bring it into present more
i enjoy seeing this movie with my grandma . we always loved to watch it during the holidays now that she is gone , remember best whenever put on shows what a difference each life makes think good thing learn
for the millions who remembered crushing despair caused by great depression , this movie reminded them of what let make it through . whether was friends family or a kind employer had all makes you think about good things that have ever happened to showing these are should be focused on even now more than half century later still has message broadcast although many pass off as corny christmas if watch is never losing hope and inherent goodness humanity will see strong in era cynicism
this is a great classic movie with donna reed and jimmy stewart . in
excellent movie! !
christmas classic . the feel-good movie of millenium i dare you not to cry !
in a word 'heartwarming'
not only is it a really enjoyable movie , but we even used part of to study in my macroeconomics class !
although cheesy , it's a must-see movie especially during christmas .
it's a great feel--good movie . i can't wait until christmas time to see it again and
one of the best movies ever made .
this is another david lean extravaganza . i don't like prison movies but always was a william holden fan so shall make an exception the movie has unpleasant content looking backwards , it doesn't nearly show brutality of japanese
this movie was great in the sense that it explored a war hero as he had never been before . surely commander good man and solider , but his lust for greatness legend came over want to fight cause eventually demise i do agree with pbeavr isn't exactly it's really more of character exploration story telling one at
one of the all time greats , a classic movie don't make em like that anymore!! !
superb last scene .
one of the few lengthy movies that fights through slower areas well and keeps audience interested . a masterful performance by guiness to me his character was madman so driven cause as soldier only at very end does he regain sanity supporting cast numerous done i would dispute this idea it war movie great escape more in overall context presentation least several moments fighting took place there were scenes with nazis motorcycle chase even had plane crash kwai drama simply used backdrop an engrossing story fine film whether you like or not
not only an incredible movie-but arguably the best movie made from a novel by pierre boulle .
a character study of men in wartime and i would say david lean's best film . three hour movie but lean is able to hold the audience's attention by developing characters first story about allied soldiers world war ii held prisoner japanese camp forced build bridge william holden plays an american soldier who escapes rescued british ask him go back there plan blow up holden's actubg wonderful however most powerful performance one ever shown on screen that alec guiness as colonel nicholson due his honor convictions refuses kowtow head prison demands col saito was played brilliantly sessue hayakawa last scene classic will have you edge your seats this not be missed
one of the classic mob movies all time . deniro is great , joe pesci explodes also it chock full quotes seeing this makes most recent mob-theme look lame
one of the greatest dramas ever filmed.asuperb cast,fantastic story and great score.alec guiness as crazed british colonel intent on showing superiority over his captors by building a bridge that will harm war effort carries this movie.playing an american who escaped from camp,william holden , turns in stirling performance man must destroy bridge.a true masterpiece .
one of my 3 favorite films . not so much a war story as character study surrounded by in the end , you really forget about wwii because are interested what will happen between characters beautifully written shot and directed acting oh alec guinness gives great performances cinema everyone else is pitch perfect underlying symbolism commentary on makes this film stand out from rest also best exciting last scenes movies
a movie about honor , and the pride to two military leaders going head on psychological battlefield instead of combat . i'm not sure why people refer it as such great war because their isn't any actual like fighting in takes place pow camp is study character extreme situations if you are looking for what i think more saving private ryan or platoon this probably after interested studying man an emotionally provoking ending by all means get simply terrific ! oh way was nominated 9 academy awards won best picture actor
best war film ever made with a great psychological between the alex guiness character and sessue hayakawa .
one of the greatest war movies all time , and another masterpiece for director that ever lived . a masterfully directed ww2 movie especially ending
the length of this movie makes for boring passages at times , but altogether is a great david lean . it portrays all spirit resistence determination and exhileration in end futility i hated ending
another david lean masterpiece .
a literally monumental cinematic landmark from alfred hitchcock (the most accessible , the kinetic and rapidly overtaking his other efforts as studied) . how everything came together to make this romance/thriller feel simultaneously lightweight terse is mystery within itself fabulous trademark casting helped with balanced cary grant icy-calm calculating of eva-marie saint dapper menace james mason another element i've always suspected was time it filmed (late 1950s ; you could see definite changes throughout society becoming manifest more-relaxed forms architecture automotive streamlining casual attitudes towards fashion etc.) hitchcock's lens captured much well-paced way but (for me) fell askance at rushmore (a poorly-lit uneven sequence that couldn't keep audience informed character positioning) even minuscule flaws i'll put up against any actioner gollywood can shove on screen today if isn't in your collection some form you're celluloid philistine who's run out excuses
cary grant clambering over mount rushmore ! this is one of the great hitchcock presentations . watch for little kid covering his ears at shooting scene in restaurant had gone through sevaral takes and knew when gunfire was to start i wonder why lemmings don't try re-make masterpiece ?
top notch film from the master of suspense . excellent in every way wonderful production values and art direction great cast , terrific beats just about everything made past 20 years
great movie . i'm not sure which i liked more - the now-famous joe pesci scene where he accuses waiter/underling of laughing at him and then shoots , or ray liotta is high paranoid trying to cook (made even better by clapton's 'layla' playing in background)
my favorite hitchcock movie , and one of top 10 all-time favorites . well acted by everyone even those w/ little or no speaking lines
perfect in every way . romance , suspense pacing top of the line hitchcock
this will always be a top notch movie , interesting characters and great music .
i think that bernard herrman deserves a ton of credit for providing the soundtrack to many hitchcock classic . anyone has heard frenzied screeching in psycho , or spacey sounds day earth stood still was his doing favourite quote northwest : plane's dustin' crops where there ain't no ! little known fact originally planned on calling film man lincoln's nose but national park people who handled mt rushmore's publicity thought title offensive treasured monument
one of the most entertaining movies all time !
the movie that invented rock climbing.mount rushmore(eve marie saint and cary grant) outclimb great bad guys-james mason martin landau .
excellent movie..one of my all time favorites . this movie had everything..great actors , an incredible script perfect soundtrack one those movies that you have no doubt these people actually exist forget they are acting..and throughout the craziness for some odd unknown reason want to be a part crazy life ! why is that?..same with godfather ending was incredible..and music along montage-perfect
my favorite hitchcock movie , because it packs so much suspense and fun into one .
if cary grant had turned out to be the agent after all , it wouldn't have been a hitchcock film . that kind of twist came in later hitch was master storytelling and tension i think closest he comes surprising us is vertigo  revelation isn't totally unexpected
i rate this one ew  , for endlessly watchable . practically perfect in every aspect
one of hitchcock's 3 or 4 best . the story is a representation hitch's most prevalent themes in his work-the innocent man wrongly accused cary grant never better than this film as socialite who mistaken for spy and gets embroiled bad situation eva-marie saint also very good at filling customary hitchcock blonde  james mason great being subtly , he goes out on closing line martin landau just plain creepy murderous henchman crop-duster scene images cinema final shot (a train going into tunnel) so brilliantly heavy innuendo department that i wonder how hitch got away with it 1959 not deep talked-about vertigo but still films ultimate adventure-thriller
though vertigo has more depth and mystery,this is for me not only the definitive hitchcock thriller but most purely enjoyable exciting adventure on film !
the best hitchcock movie . how this gets rated lower than psycho , which is horrifically overrated beyond me cary grant at his smooth-talking eva marie saint beautiful and stylish as damsel in distress james mason does a wonderful job portraying slick urbane criminal from acting to cinematography bernard herrmann's score perfection
first class , toungue-in-cheek suspense thriller by the greatest filmmaker of all time ! north northwest does not deserve to be this low on list at i would think that such an entertaining movie top
an outstanding movie . i never understood why ray liotta didn't become a bigger star guess he again got script as good this one i'm big fan of first-person narrative movies and has to be my absolute favorite among them
one of my favorite hitchcock movies (and i've seen almost all them) . cary grant and eva marie saint have amazing chemistry the suspense is equally magical
i love hitchcock . also airplans
i don't like prison films , but made an exception for this one starring william holden and others . the scene where otto preminger puts on his cavalry boots to take telephone call from berlin is priceless ! flick still has some of that old thirties film noir flair
a real classic movie . would have liked to see sequal made
stalag 17 has a terrific balance of comedy and drama.it was written by billy wilder at his best stars william holden .
stark , stirring and poignantly acted by a great cast featuring henry fonda jane darwell in the lead roles as tom ma joad . each of supporting characters provide capable backing story that is heavy it's somber mood retold through director john ford's interpretation steinbeck classic are best captured expressions on their beleagured faces use soundtrack imagery fonda's sad but determined farewll speech to near end film ma's resolve upon climax two more memorable moments both rendered masterfully these fine actors
i figured it out pretty early in the movie (kind of obvious if you think about it) , but was still fun to watch unravel .
henry fonda and an ensemble of many the ususal john ford players did outstanding job . red river valley as theme song is heart-breaking
without a doubt , john steinbeck's 'the grapes of wrath' belongs in the national registry culturally significant motion pictures . this movie along with great acting by henry fonda jane darwell and carradine pulls no punches showing its audience deplorable shattered lives california-bound okies during depression tragic quality is magnified individual characters who are engulfed an ongoing misery yet inspires hope as darwell's ma joad poignantly expresses positive message at conclusion we're people concludes they were
this is a great movie . it shows the hardship that oklahomans went thru during depression and dust bowl
this movie is one of my very favorites . i don't think will ever get tired watching it great acting by all the cast and so sad
this movie is a classic for all the reasons brought out by other reviewers . what i most liked about it , however is. first almost dreamy mood created dialogue lighting and editing you feel quiet desperation of these people secondly like stark crisp beauty black & white photography
excellent cast and story , but is it ever sad . a family of okies head out to california hoping for better life really flies back in their faces definitely tear-jerker
the mom holding up earrings - great ! fonda oakies very realistic , and touching .
great movie . the final scenes of are fabulous i even liked baldwin brother in this
this is one of the all time greats john ford need i say more ? not only are actors in movie intence , but you can actually feel there pain . to a masterpeice would be an understatement depression era oklohoma joads' middle dust bowl little food even less money get evicted from land and move west california search better life.they have nothing exept willpower keep them going.and they prove that enough.the fighters survivers dreamers sort way we americians think ourselves today bad happens manage find good.times change for or good must seek what about.
this steinbeck classic is perhaps my favorite movie . it one of the best book-to-movie translations i have ever seen
the most realistic of classics .
a brilliantly done film , easily one of hitchcocks best . full mordant humour in addition to the horror hitchcock makes use symbolism movied note particularly janet leigh's underwear and stuffed animals
this classic action flick would be the best of all time if it were not for it's follower- last crusade . stars harrison ford and karen allen ( who is at her sexiest ) in quest ark covenant special effects are superb , story line marvelous suspense taut go rent immediately
excellent stuff . tarantino should take tips from this on how to make a quality action thriller top performances all around as for the comment jerricabenton...yeah..sure you had it figured out! !
i must have been about five when first saw psycho . that shower scene scared me then and still trips out a little
oh geez , no more showers for me after i saw this movie at age 8 . well i'd shower but my mom would always yell all the water on floor (i was showering with curtain drawn) a first class psycho-drama that upped ante horror
it it's time , i guess this was one of the most suspenseful and frightening movies day . you never expect a main character to be so brutally killed in very first part movie still don't want think about when shower is without doubt hitchcock masterpiece
the master movie from himself - sir alfred . being a lifelong buff , i can honestly say that no has caught me so off guard by its sheer jolt power just when you think is taking in one direction it does complete 180 and several times psycho holy grail of all suspense/horror/thriller films portayal norman bates anthony perkins incredible once see it's totally inconceivable anyone else could possibly played role not only my favorite horror but time if hitchcock was van gogh...psycho would be his starry night
kudos to janet leigh who just died today . her acting in this film was magnificent loved the ending ; is a masterpiece of pyschological thriller
excellent movie . the only time it falters is overly long explanation scene at end with psychiatrist anthony perkins suitably creepy as norman bates there are several outstanding scenes including those mother , parlor marion and lila looking for etc janet leigh sexy very sympathetic i remember seeing psycho first on tv when was about 13 totally shocked takes a complete u-turn had no idea what in store so stunned nowadays whole plot given away by reviewers descriptions dvd or video cases this shame - has much more of an impact if you don't know anything acting editing writing directing cinematography all first-rate however music score bernard herrmann deserves special mention odd shrieking violins drives film keeps viewer interested also provides ominous tension throughout one most memorable films ever best hitchcock !
a very good movie . alfred hitchcock at his best janet leigh plays marion crane who steals money from her place of work and takes off she ends up the bates motel.big mistake ! an odd man named norman runs motel.along with mother lives in eerie house on hill.halfway through stabs to death shower.this is shock since i did not expect main character die halfway movie.relatives worried about marion's missing come looking for end same motel.anthony perkins great as strange terrific mother.a that was predictable just well done without all goriness sometimes comes suspensful movies.a real classic
this is a good movie ! i love the music and bond between norman his mother very interesting . it's one that started all great slasher flicks we have , it just has effect on you don't know makes wanna watch loved
directed by alfred hitchcock , psycho (1960) is often considered the first modern film as it breached previously taboo subjects (eg premarital relations) . for uninitiated marion crane (janet leigh) on run after embezzling some money she ultimately seeks temporary shelter at bates motel norman (anthony perkins) and his unseen mother soon finds out that things are not they seem quickly meets her demise in now famous shower scene an excellent example of how used suspense rather than immediate gore surprise to build tempo plot horror bottom line had aged extremely well due art went into direction cinematography
a brilliant alfred hitchcock masterpiece . dynamite script hooks the viewer from bernard hermann's excellent opening strings norman bates is not just one dimensional psycho , he's complicated vulnerable and almost feels sorry for him fantastic performance by anthony perkins marion crane(played wonderfully janet leigh) an innocent victim either fact that she's embezzeling money makes it even better famous shower scene no matter how many times watches this movie still manages to shock where martin arbogast murdered actually more heart pounding testament hitchcock's genius classic thriller/horror others don't compare
hitchcock knew how to scare you without stabbing three quarters of the cast death . he build suspense and make it pay off things did in this movie have been copied so many times , it's not even funny
this movie was excellent - i saw it when very young , but is a must-see whenever it's on in reruns . there are 2 classic scenes : the shower scene and where car slowly sinks to bottom of lake both have been copied more times than can count hitchcock's masterpiece my opinion way ahead its time which makes modern psychological sexual violent aspects were first history forerunner slasher film
my second favorite hitchcock movie , next to north by northwest . amazingly suspenseful scary and well-directed acted shot
the best of all time damnit scariest norman bates kicks ass oh god mother blood stop it i wont kill u dirty boy are sastsified with ur cabin
not only is it wonderfully done and incredibly suspenseful , has an extremely deep story the script witty wonderful . perhaps best of all tony perkins shines like no other performance in cinema as norman bates
i knew the novel before saw movie , so when norman bates was a little fearful that wouldn't be able to accept him as psychotic . book described being plump and red-faced but mr perkins did great job of charming quirky musical score is this absolutely one hitchcock's best
hitchcock's best film , and the movie that started a new genre of . slasher would not exist without this gritty disturbing surprising utterly terrifying masterpiece obsession schitzophrenia lust perversity there is no halloween texas chainsaw massacre friday 13th nightmare on elm street scream believe it or still one them all citizen kane horror films cinema's greatest directors achievment
a brilliant script , spectacular performances from spacey and byrne career everyone else . one of the best movies ever
what can one say ? this is the most suspenseful movie ever made ! alfred hitchcock pooled together all of his knowledge pure cinema and rolled it into on big , black-and-white exploitation thriller . a very influential film to least
back in 1959 , no one could believe that alfred hitchcock was going to shoot a movie for mere $800,000 just 30 days using the crew from his tv series presents . moreover they couldn't understand why he adapting pulp novel by robert bloch inspired gruesome career of wisconsin serial killer ed gein reaction must have been much like bewilderment at news gus van sant intended direct shot-for-shot remake this very masterpiece everyone be familiar now with events bates motel indeed folks tend overlook biggest and most glorious macguffins hitchcock's - life crime marion crane (leigh) her illicit hotel rendezous marriage-shy lover sam loomis (john gavin) theft $40,000 tortuous drive outskirts fairvale take up goodly portion picture it seems business as usual master suspense until takes shower  psycho blackest cynical manipulative feature introduced american nightmare strain into genre also revived fast-fading art montage legendary sequence accompaniment bernard hermann's shrieking strings hitch (and visual consultant saul bass) packed 87 cross-cuts frenzied 45 seconds create perfectly timed shock since odessa steps massacre battleship potemkin throw some fluid camera movements odd technical flourish superb performances (notably leigh remarkable perkins) occasional heart-stopping jolt trick ending (the rarely seen norman/mother superimposition) you timeless classic which needed does citizen kane summary : frightening chiller greatest all thrillers
what?? ? psycho is a masterpiece ! probably the best movie of all time and destiny23 calls it dull!! to everyone who did not say was great film , i have defense . anubis you this really then give 4 which = good anyway u that its considering how old what movies do watch?? came out in 1960 never seen ben-hur rebel without cause 12 angry men anything by chaplin most any hitchock or wilder?? as callmetootie first half very suspenseful brilliantly done fact shower scene 50 minutes into amazing - director killed off main character middle shocking if dont know coming daring since before read some analysies about study will like more seem literary reeks with symbollism foreshadowings it's dark comedy recurring images domilyn add star for me find init's joke funny would were other but bring down psycho's rating!! revote baci
suspense and terror , but not gore . hitchcock created a must-see movie only those with poor imaginations will find this film dull hitchcock's swinging lightbulb use of shadows throughout the is amazing
one of hitchcock's masterpieces . psycho is a really scary movie and probably the best its genre to ever be made staple for all people , no matter if you're fan or not
hitchcock's masterpiece of suspense
this is on my top 10 list .
simply a fantastic piece of work . one the best acting roles in history movies , is done this film by anthony perkins i have never seen someone who can so fully play part what magnificent job action exciting horror intense and general total 5 star stuff definitely see it for anyone
the american film institute has chosen psycho as scariest (er...most heart-pounding) movie of all-time . i would certainly agree although am not too fond sub-genre that this spawned (the slasher flick) , a fan alfred hitchcock and what he done is created one most famous influential motion pictures ever ! psycho's technical brilliance rarely matched it's entertainment value undeniably great conceived somewhat black comedy without question sophisticated horror made
if i could would give it 6 stars ! this movie was just awesome . granted , is not for people who don't pay attention the twists and turns will leave you in dark or can't use your head more than a hat rack spacey byrne stephen baldwin chaz palmenteri even del torro were all grat one creative script love
psycho is the greatest suspense thriller (not horror movie) of all time , without question ! sure it does move along at a slow pace but such necessary in order to build . first half hour builds up shower sequence while rest movie moves same keep apprehention minds audience this certainly one few times where made for being absolutely spectacular
don't even bother with the inferior (and unecessary) 1998 psycho remake anne heche and vince vaughan . 1960 original shot in black white remains a testament to cinematic genius of director alfred hitchcock that janet leigh's staring dead eye after shower scene still gives me jitters ! just expect visit by freddy kruger if you haven't seen already only startling her is where character murdered norman bates rest movie entirely predictable but well-written acted
chilling.. . hitchcock's darkest and (in my opinion) his most mysterious possibly best (a close race w/ vertigo) recommended to all
i made a huge ,istake and saw the remake first . thought that it was so terrible didn't even want to see this one , but when did watch surprised at how superior is very creepy scary without all of blood-splatter recent horror films probably 3rd scarriest movie i've ever seen
seeing it as a little girl,i really didn't like psycho , was too freaky . but now i understand better and think its great!! !
one of the greatest horror fils ever right behing exorcist . this film may not appeal to kids , who think should be nothing but special effects with lots gore story is well written and most people can't forget shower scene terrific movie back in day when films were done
this movie defined what scary movies should be like . alfred hitchcock was a genius for his time he set the standard these types of shower scene is and will always best in any way they made it great
this movie is the best horror i've ever seen ! it isn't gory , but so creepy . real effect after when you think back
inspired by ed gein , this movie is still very intense . the remake absolutely sucks !
psychologically interesting . scary and tense characters are i got into the main character could happen.. ha !
what can i say.. . hitchcock was a genius when it came to suspense and horror psycho is masterpiece this as good classic movies get
hitchcock was master of presenting the most important scenes and allowing viewer to form their own opinions . as he did not have show murder , all had shadows by doing this actually made scene scarier there are somethings that will forever remain classics hitchcock's psycho is one them
i find most of alfred hitchcock's work to be masterpiece material . psycho was a art and displayed the carnal nature that exists beneath threshold consciousness often times flourishes in overt actions man
i only saw it in french , which was pretty fun so got to make up what they were saying twas cool.. . oh and the music cool too...
keeps you guessing the whole time
the best horror movie i've ever seen [!!] , though it was not as funny scream.. . :o)
i still can't take a shower , annother good head trip
ok i am going to give it a 5 for old times sake two reasons . the counterpoint of marseilles with die wacht rhein and ingrid bergman film is showing its age , 1940's flashback device annoying
they just don't make them like that any more . casablanca is great concise story telling , a human drama played against larger than life back drop there characters with their better nature coming up flaws andtheir past incredible witty dialogue delivered by fabulous actors even the minor character roles karl waiter and major strasser are pitch perfect if it seems cliche or predictable it's only because has become such film icon
superb .
this is a most definite 5 rating . bogart at his best
this is one of two my favorite movies . humphrey bogart was at his very best as the cynical and disillusioned rick blaine , who brought back to life so speak by love a cause which bigger than him what amazing about movie that script written daily not even writers knew how would end it testament talent all involved made let alone become classic for ages personal scene when paul heinred victor lazlo conrad veidt vied dominance with their respectives patriotic songs an unbelievably inspiring no but ingrid bergman could have portrayed ilsa she owned role also included character actors s.z sakall carl making its finest
outstanding , marvelous fantastic!movie making at it's best!humphrey his best !
this was the first movie we watched in my school's film class year , and i can't argue with its reputation as one of greatest movies all time : great performances from whole cast an interesting story memorable characters dozens lines intelligent well-written screenplay ample amount witty humor to boot . saying goes they don't make 'em like anymore it's a damn shame
i've watched this movie several times and each time i watch it reaffirms my belief that is the best film ever made . everything in done perfectly acting , suspense soundtrack dialogue theme of idealism over love can't think a better 20 minutes than when ilsa first enters to end flashback france will just get as goes by
it can't be rated high enough .
one of the best movies all time . i see something new everytime watch it script , performances and direction are superb
what a fantastic film . it's chock full of classic moments , from the french belting their national anthem over drunken germans voices to unforgettable ending all acting is top notch and screenplay never disappoints
true classic , but man you just wish she would stay with him at the end never does . i realized what a stunning beauty ingrid bergman was until saw this film and did ever get ripped off by oscars ! they didn't even nominate her for sickening
this movie works on so many levels . first there is not one bad or boring scene in it hooks the viewer from beginning second you have to appreciate history behind film , and admire fact that some of lines were written an hour before they aired are still quoted today finally understand time came out right during world war ii for warner brothers was just another had no idea impact would make why such a great ? it's story having loved lost trust betrayl loving two men doing honorable thing characters ambigious true fleshed hero villian has greatest casts any humphrey bogart ingrid bergman paul henreid claude rains conrad veidt dooley wilson s.z sakall sydney greenstreet peter lorre each give memorable performance once watch casablanca don't forget
this deserves to be #1 on the classic movies list , despite fact that i'd give 5 stars each of top 10 .
a very good action/thriller with strong cast . this is movie which requires you to pay attention in order fully understand the ending , great twist film benicio del toro's breakthrough role he plays character that will give few laughs overall thriller and superb
this movie is brilliant . it's a real classic
the best movies never try to show off
it's surprising , when you look at a film like this that is so well-entrenched as classic and realize it still has great power not aged all . everyone should see masterpiece least once in their lives multiple viewings recommended #2 on the afi list for reason
one for the ages , to be sure ! casablanca is entertainment at its best . ensemble cast brilliant michael curtiz's direction great max steiner's score forever fixed in our movie conscience screenplay flawless and it wholey deserving of praise greatest movies all time
it doesn't get much better than this !
when something has entered the consciousness as deeply casablanca - everyone from woody allen (play it again sam) to simpsons riffed on becomes a film that many younger fans can talk about and quote , even though few have probably seen . this is which should be rectified immediately it's much more fun than its stuffy greatest ever made tag suggests with literate script stylish direction great song cinema's most romantic couple in bogie bergman must-see one of summary : films awesome !
one of the things i hate most about old movies that people talk being great is they claim reasons as ahead its time . well since wasn't around then it very difficult for me to appreciate those acclaim revolutionary what so casablanca can watch first today and without having any idea were like when was made fall in love with simplistic nobody would probably think making a movie now however , sometimes simple yields success story suspense different setting from i've ever seen finally an good some reason other than truly masterpiece
one time the oscars got it right.casablanca speaks for itself : of all gin joints in towns world,she walks into mine  . here's looking at you,kid round up usual suspects play again,sam (misquote,but part legend) we'll always have paris i think this is beginning a beautiful friendship
i bought this movie on dvd without watching it my brother's suggestion . he talked so much about being one of his favourites , thought was going to be great the first time watched dissapointed with entire except for ending course then a second and everything came together knowledge had made rest better now is say have over 20 times no joke
truly a classic ! bogart and bergman are absolutely fantastic as heinreid , rains greenstreet lorre . michael curtiz's direction is great he sure knew how to make movies of course there max steiner's score well whenever you hear the song time goes by don't have an instant recollection ? excellent movie
casablanca was one of the first classic movies i had ever seen . 16 and thought that may not reach my expectations after having 50-odd years so-called hype let me just say thoroughly , completely utterly wrong no other film have seen--both past present--has so percisely beautifully understatedly communicated sacrifices made desperation felt by europeans during wwii-era
greatest movie of all time . humphrey bogart's best mixed together a perfect combination love , deceit war and trace amount humor appropriate for people ages but younger humans may not understand it to the full extent this deserves ingrid bergman was very good in loveable singer sam added lots drama becuase usually when key scene occurred he played music
great story , moments . what could be better ?
the best movie of all times
it is the perfect movie and antithesis of all that wrong with today's movies.the dialogue , cast moves like gangbusters . in a word impeccable !
one of the greatest and most acclaimed american films all time . bogart plays his character in a perfectly ambivalent fashion , bergman is lovely film epitome noir so if you don't like quality or any other movies from that period this probably won't make difference has at its essence profiteer's love for an unattainable woman with whom he had previous relationship story classic description fails to do it justice remember though very little action some scenes rely on audience using their visual sense rather than dialogue
perhaps hollywood's most legendary film . casablanca not only succeeds in pleasing audiences over and again , it is also one of the important works cinema history bogart bergman are backed up by a stellar supporting cast heinreid rains veidt greenstreet lorre what more there to say ?
kevin spacey stands out amongst an exceptional cast . brilliant
casablanca is very hot in the summer last year i went to morocco it was so at night everyone took there clothes of.i love there,if anyone that a comiding can he get touch with us moroccan company
the most inspiringmovie of all time . combines humor with romance and suspense reflects period well there's no wonder it is origin many famous quotes
casablanca : an american movie classic best viewed in the original black and white . story based setting of world war ii , as people escape from france nazis move also follows two lovers who meet morocco again one already established a nightclub owner other escaping with her husband plot becomes interesting when meets his love never knew about but despite bitterness is their only way out strongly recommended for those like stories found lost
this movie is great for many reasons . of the things that make don't stand out very well by today's standards but , if you look at time it was made truly shines first one main characters black he heroes and in a with greatest actors era humphrey bogart also other than sam intentions are all rather ambiguous moment you'll see bogie handing his friend over to nazis next he's smuggling polish rebels american good guys aren't so bad some just can't tell there were no shining or slimy villians gray occupies large space between them an where had be pure went against grain
one of the best films ever made . technology used in filming was revolutionary at time beautiful performances by bogart and bergman film is well put together enjoyable
sacrifice is part of love .
one of my favorite , definitely classic film . the love between bogart and bergman is truly unique dialogue without equal there are a number great scenes particularly last this movie more than lives up to its reputation
this is on my top 10 list .
fantistic cast , twists and turns that can make you dizzy .
one of my all-time favorites .
humphrey bogart is too cool .
an absolutely remarkable movie . great story , performances.. fun to watch think about.. one of the all-time greats !
i love this classic story . watched it three times it's so moving
casablanca- the ultimate classic . great photography , story line acting music- much unlike any contemporary american film
this is a smart movie that fools you until the end . excellent
casablanca was one of the classics never to be forgotten . its quotes and scenes will live forever keep playin' it again sam..
this is one my favorites too . fascinating story , great cast and its still fresh interesting a must see for everyone
indeed one of my favorite hitchcock movies , right next to "the birds" . stewart and kelly are lovely opposite another rewatching it after a few years the film was still as suspenseful intriguing i first remembered when you can revisit couple find fresh exciting did initially shows films true quality !
jimmy stewart and grace kelly in a hitchcock movie ! what could be better . raymond burr plays great villain sees murder out of the rear window his room where he is laid up with broken leg or was it ? heavy
one of hitchcock's best . jimmy stewart and (wow) grace kelly in my favorite classics all time did the neighbor commit murder or not ? it's a simple question spun into very good film
this is a wonderful movie filled with suspense . i watch it every chance get jimmy stewart plays great role
my 2nd favorite hitchcock move , after north by northwest . this movie is the very definition of suspense in opinion
awesome movie in every aspect . wonderful suspense , i love the camera flashing at end!! ! ahhh
great movie . james stewart is a photographer who apartment bound when he has broken leg passes time by watching his neighbors in other apartments gets suspicious of one neighbor convinced killed wife girlfriend involved and suspense follows.in trying to get others believe what saw good directed alfred hitchcock
the usual suspects like fight club is one of those movies that you can't digest once . have to watch it again in order catch references may been previously overlooked a well written almost flawless script based on simple setting band criminals who meet after police line up furthering their career successful heist catching attention kyzer soze using flashbacks , cross-cutting and kevin spacey's clear intricate narration we see ending this film why makes most engaging skillful intelligent cinematic history
very well made by hitchcock . he really tackled the challenge of filming an entire movie from one spot lives up to his master suspense title in this
perry mason(raymond burr) is better as a bad guy .
one of my very favorite hitchcocks . metaphorically , it is about the dangers peering too closely into dark spaces in others or indeed ourselves stifling : between small room feeling being crippled and awful muggy summer heat makes you sweat like protagonist buildup to climax amazing
a brilliant film . hitchcock takes simple story and brings depth to it the style alone rivets you screen
jimmy stewart and grace kelly are excellent in this classic film . almost the entire utilizes one set , suspense is kelly's beauty cannot be denied recommended to anyone who likes hitchcock
this is definitely my favorite hitchcock movie . it effectively capitalizes on people's desires to watch others i was always wondering what jimmy stewarts' character would see in his neighbor's windows next then became increasingly dark and suspenseful when he suspected one of neighbors murder the buildup suspense masterful showcased made such a great director !
this has to be my all time favorite . it is a wonderful film
a classic suspense film . among alfred hitchcock's best , and that's saying lot !
great film , and well made too .
this movie is so cool . it's awesome to see a where it all takes place in one room
my personal favorite hitchcock film . it's so well written , acted and directed that as the suspence builds slowly up you become more engrossed until sucks in forget where are also entire is done one place that's cool it shows hitch's real sense of when he could make was entertaining with only set many today's directors would be creative
rear window is one of alfred hitchcock's greatest achievements . a tour de force on the asthetics why we watch , whether it be movies or anything else he's like an artist painting picture that so realistic you'd swear was actual photograph that's how good he and hitchcock should have received oscar for his work film because along with vertigo ultimate artist's masterpiece
man i have seen a lot of take-offs this . shows how absolutely great , inspirational and essential it is - not to mention suspenseful chilling brilliant when watched the first time didn't know if neighbour was guilty or innocent all big mystery an absolute masterpiece one hitchcock's greatest simply be missed hasn't aged bit summary :
this provocative , thought inspiring classic hitchcock sees james stewart at his best and grace kelly as lovely ever
an alfred hitchock classic - great performances from james stewart and grace kelly . one of the most suspenseful scenes on film when character goes to snoop in apartment across way whne its owner( raymond burr) returns unexpectedly
hitchcock's best film ever . photographer gets injured , spies on neighbor while kills his wife and removes her from house finds out attacks him caught everyone else lives happily after the movie is much more powerful than its summary
superb ! a most deftly created intricate storyline coupled with fantastic acting and character development , reminiscent of older coen classics better than the over-rated tarantino yarns.. . kudos to bryan singer byrne spacey rest them masterpiece from beginning end especially
this remains my all-time favorite movie ! i can never get tired of watching it . course , it's an excellent anything hitchcock puts his hands on is a sure-fire masterpiece
this hitchcock thriller is amazing . jimmie stewarrt at his finest makes popular classic an eternal hit if you only see one film , make it the rear window
great film ! i love catching this one on the television some random night , it's best way to see it . that grace kelly..ouch hurt me what's jimmy doing looking out window so much for when he's got her hanging around?!?
the all time best hitchcock movie
john huston makes a great heart of darkness in reverse movie . my criticism is that bogart always played the same character , and kate hepburn was mildly annoying what fun to compare guide us now oh jehovah performed by robert morely at beginning with welsh version cym rhondda sung miners how green valley ? film notable for being filmed on location
great movie with katherine hepburn , and humphrey bogart . i put off seeing this because did not think would like it turned out to be a good hepburns character is missionary in africa her brother during world war 1 sort of mailman who delivers goods area rosie's dies after an attack on the village charlie helps get rosie down river african queen his steam boat.they go through some adventures along way dealing treacherous end up caring for each other even though they are very different personalities both actors do job won oscar role
movie grabs and sticks to you like a leech !
a fantastic bogart/hepburn film . i think this is one of my most favorites it has drama , love and humor with great acting
a favorite of mine . great acting throughout
a fantastic movie . i always love bogey , but even hepburn is great in this one (she's not of my faves) reminds me swept away.. bit (the italian classic the dumb madonna crap) there's adventure comedy etc. an undercurrent sexual tension it - note metaphors her having orgasm going down rapids and them getting on by middle when they've fallen every romance since like romancing stone uses same plot devices character development etc despite all that you really see first rate acting these 2 shouldn't work together they do almost wanted to ! made rethink idea missionary
one of the best movies i have ever seen ! it had comedy , romance drama adventure...a perfect movie
great movie , mainly because of the interraction between hepburn and bogart . you feel like are part ride as they go up river
bogart and hepburn battle for survival against the sweep of a broader , encompassing world war . hepburn's character is perfectly in-tune with situation which may be unappreciated by younger viewers who do not understand that people were often way in reality crusty to perfection only learning reluctantly can make real contribution his chances life
two wonderful actors!! ! with such weak characters at the beginning , they make people you wanna help and support in their adventures .
one of my favorite bogart movies .
bogart and hepburn . prim cocky lace parisol blood sucking leeches that plucky old boat being dragged through the weeds aaa , it doesn't get any better
the african queen is a great movie . bogey and k hepburn were pair
terrific flick , a must see .
the movie was stellar . agree with other respondent , it humphrey bogart's best of many great portrayals he perfectly conveyed paranoia obsessive compulsive behavior and veiled cowardice lcdr phillip queeg incredible casting van johnson (later became green hornet) fred mcmurry (playing a heel) jose ferrer book (written by herman wouk) is even better no story captures responsibility accountability military officer at war than caine mutiny read rent video
one great film . my favorite borgart performance if you like bogie , you'll love this !
gone with the wind is a classic epic for many reasons . film very well thought out , and stayed pretty close to book ( i read somewhere that if they actually filmed every page of movie would have lasted over 12 hours or so ) thing made this delightful legendary performances by gable leigh though two despised eachother in real life there no evidence their onscreen chemistry wonderful dialouge when came " frankly my dear don't give damn" caused uproar first time "a swear word" was used its quite funny now you think it what be said our movies today ? keeps viewer interested throughout can sit through titanic certainly 3 half goes quickly once become involved story as any other classical fan will tell "golden era" hollywood alot longer then 1 hr 20 minute we are more painful anything coming age main character scarlett while she may annoying at times end see different woman gables charm wit another aspect de havilands portrayal selfless sister just amazing truthful about one dislikes ashley disliking him his isnt appealing slightest can't seem make up mind he truly loves sum review because emotional ties it's acted thoughtout arent given necessary show love really all
this is a solid movie all around which features great acting cast ensemble . when watching , you will know why kevin spacey won an oscar for his role verbal kint the has very well- written plot line with grest twist-ending that manages to fill in questions asked beginning of film bryan singer director two x-mex movies and apt pupil proven he could become big name hollywood future
this is a test of the troll alert system : gone with wind one greatest movies all time . i'd pay 20 bucks to see it fifth only
i first saw it in 1948 . guess you gotta give a 5 , but how that wimp ashley could resist scarlett is beyond me thomas mitchell really great this flick
love the storyline and it really is a timeless classic . watched this movie over weekend i loved just as much first time saw one character don't care for miss scarlet she seemed to marry more than elizabeth taylor also was very self absorbed , seeming crush anyone who came in her path ending when rhett tells where stick
this is a throwback to the 50s and 60s.one can almost imagine humphrey bogart in . bryan singer did an excellant job with movie one of my all time favorites should have taken oscar for best picture.twisting turning constantly that gets better repeated viewings
i think the reason love movie so much is because of characters in . they are all beautifully written , and you really feel like get to know each principal scarlett my opinion one most complex ever she starts out as a silly teenager who only cares about herself boys parties (like teenage girls) then tragedies hardships has grow up become this very mature woman capable taking care not but her entire family acting perfect actor/actress embrasses their character vivian leigh especially own by far best ensemble cast any
epic!powerful!hugely entertaining !
excellent epic about the civil war with geninue acting...this movie will live in our hearts forever .
latima duma kaizer soze ! i loved the bulletin board scene that tied everything together . verbal's right afterwards just makes film (although telling of kazier is pretty damn cool too)
the greatest movie of all time ! vivien leigh is great as scarlett o'hara and she deserved every award for it . mammy was very funny provided a good dramatic foil there certainly chemistry between rhett (clark gable) will probably be remembered provide an example what actors should do
a friend of mine used to be crazy about this movie all her teenaged and adult life . she tried get me watch it , but i thought would old boring started my love affair with gwtw qne month ago have watched the at least once week since then just keeps getting better am reading book now junkie read scarlett they are perfect compliment both original movie.vivian leigh clark gable were match for film.truly greatest story ever told !
i try to carefully say this about film because realize it is not easy characterize any of the classics in manner : quite possibly best american ever written and produced .
one of the better made movies . just as great today years ago i saw this at first a teenager and so did my daughter movie is bit different from book but it well cast with vivian leigh scarlett , clark gable rhett.a very long if you have good four hours to spare worth done in every way
it took me literally years to sit down and actually watch the whole thing , even then two nights but i'm glad i finally did . always felt that this was a bit of chick flick  it's well worth watching for everyone one few epic movies contains solid story throughout while still maintaining viewer's interest acting excellent as guess who think clark gable's famous line at end frankly my dear don't give damn delivered with lack enthusiasm on his part
the ultimate love story . too bad scarlett was such a bitch i wanted to slap her
excellent . masterpiece material right here watched it in school (took the whole day) and loved most kids hated , but i found really interestiing like first half best second seemed to dull out a little came back at end many memorable scenes what do say all of you who dont this comment well frankly don't give damn..
loved it . love vivien and clark
maybe it's because i'm a historian , or i love studying the civil war-era but to me this is #1 movie of all-time . vivian lee stunning and clark gable flawless best job casting in history short perfect every way
some people have real nerve not to give this a five star rating . yes , it's long but glorious in its length scope and feeling the greatest film of all time probably most famous vivien leigh clark gable roles that defined their careers heart-rending final act many unforgettable scenes along way (like harrowing civil war parts) one films everyone must see lifetime
love it . its nice and long ; you really take a vacation from reality enter into the south during civil war
greatest american film !
had this movie not such a charming cast , rousing score or any mass appeal i don't think it would be the is today . personally while do like very much and deserving of four star rating gone with wind wasn't too impressed first half spectacular second moves slower than car in middle rush hour still great film somewhat it's praise
it's a classic
best civil war movie ever made . there's no prettier southern belle than vivian leigh as scarlett o'hara
i love this movie and the costumes are great!! ! could'nt believe rhett left her , but it was great when they got back together in scarlett  .
great movie . i still can't think the was made in 1939 story is told an excellent way , especially civil war period this will be one of my all time favorite
this is my all time favorite movie ! it sooo well done in every way and can be compared to any , even era
this has been one of my favourite movies for years and :) i've read the book as well , i think cast was very well-chosen historical account told story - course riveting ! is a true classic it's pretty easy to see why
only those north of the mason-dixon line fail to understand why we southerner's love this movie . despite a generation dispargers , remains one greatest all time casting is excellent actors are probably most excellently cast any storyline little weak as stereotyped southern ninny in scarlett would see that rhett has qualities far beyond wimpy ashley i want give her good shaking every movie.the sets and lighting throughly
probably some of the best casting , costumes and sets in hollywood history - not to mention a timeless story . like wizard oz  it's another example has ever had or will have offer
when i finished reading gone with the wind was devestated that it over . immediately flipped back to beginning remember 'how used be' only 14 movie carried me away once again ! fate cast vivien leigh as scarlet , and who else but clark gable could have been rhett butler? felt like shaking yelling 'it's you love can't see ? he's one don't let him go 'frankly my dear give a damn!' is of best parting lines written
gone with the wind depicts a bygone era of grace and charm old south . while love story was intermixed civil war , it shows how women had to be strong survive scarlette epitomy all slyness back then her devilish won many hearts i wish for short time...we could experience that period time
the absolute best movie of all time ! i give it more than 5 stars .
i think that the civil war is an important time in american history . how book intertwined a love story with drama of really interesting
i think that gone with the wind is greatest . clark gable and vivian leigh are perfect
i remember seeing my mother closing a book just after she had finished it . misty-eyed said to herself , now that is great story ! was gone with the wind decided read and found then movie came along as re-release (back in early 70's when they still did sort of thing)the wasn't exactly like but film experience for me filmed during height hollywood's golden era there perfect character actor each role will ever happen again ? gwtw an eternal classic vivien leigh deservedly won best actress oscar god witness...i'll never be hungry atlanta fire swear could feel heat on face while sitting theatre
although it's very long , this is one of the best movies i've ever seen ! costumes are beautiful and really add alot .
it is a great piece of its' time , scarlett o'hara one the best heroines on face this planet . way she could control any man and still protect love her life tara !
what good movie this was , i'd hate to piss of kaiser sousae !
gone with the wind- great film every time you watch it . i dig scarlett
great movie!! ! even better book! what was scarlett thinking when she realized it rhett wanted and not ashley ?
i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
not as good the book bet very well done .
gone w/the wind is an eternal classic .
this is a great movie ! and it good representation of it's time .
one of my favorite hitchcock movies . you have to take the movie in context when it was released for 60's this quite chilling suspense alone is sheer genius , and effects were outstanding at point cinema's history perfomances perfect hedren did amazingly well her first film portrayed typical socialite brilliantly taylor male "hero" tandy wonderfully annoying as ever watchful mother i admit thinking immediately whenever see a flock seagulls go beach so that's gotta say something impact on our subconcious!! !
saw this movie , when it came out in los angeles calif . we left the theater birds there flying around that night got to me
a true classic , worthy of 5 stars . the scene where gas starts flowing across street builds up to creepiness unknown in most horror films today cast is excellent and story flows nicely
if you have not seen this movie yet , what are doing on the internet ? is best ever made . superb acting writing score everything it will throw for a loop then another unfolds like great novel and demands repeat viewing
teppi hedren is an insufferable airhead . jessica tandy looks , well overly paranoid also stars a very young veronica cartwright who gets some of the best lines in this offbeat movie great visuals and sound design with no score to speak although children's song timely editing used effect not scary slow at first but fun watch from point that tippy tippi her head drilled by seagull
anytime i see a black bird of any type sitting on fence or an electrical line , run  !
some joker suggests wesley snipes was in this movie . duh ? actually , is classic hitchcock although the last scene edited out which explains why birds acted way they did you have to read book get answer but it a good also tippi hedren hot just my type ! rod taylor very actor (hotel) does his thing well suspense builds and playground when are gathering kids schoolroom singing 'wissletee wassletee' oblivious or danger perfect example of medium excelled dark someone suggested should been done black white..well i must seen ted turner colorized version
the birds is an extremly chilling and scary movie that stars supermodel of 60's , tippi hedren . film pretty bloody for it's time it graphic but i would want my kids to see because them get used watching these good movies
hitchcock at his best . considering it was produced in the 60's , sfx are fantastic plot is usual suspense and making you wait to see what happens really does ask a question - would we do if different species turned on us?? ? oh yes since when wesley snipes films done 60's????
see if you can figure out why the birds kill people . can't , story is my daphne du maurier and hitchcock edited final scene in film (which explained)
what a classic!from the gripping storyline to ultimately cool finale this film will rest in your imagination for long time . kevin spacey is magnetic and along with some good support , makes classic noir / thriller
wesley snipes was great in this movie . i could watch over and
second only to vertigo as far hitchcock films go this film beautifly combines love and suspense . cary grant is at his best which adds my frustration that he never recieved an oscar ingrid bergmann nearly trumps her casablanca role it's sad you can purchase dvd for $40 ! (only offered a criterion collection disk) i guess could buy mi2 if want see movie poorly done
yes , fantastic movie . hitchcock's 4th best and in the top 50 for sure of 40 besides double indemnity great dictator (see those movies) interesting plot cary grant ingrid bergman performances their careers (woooo ! casablanca play it again sam no she's better notorious!) claude rains is particulary as well but his performance mr smith.. could be i wish were more opinionionitive
one of hitchcock's masterpieces as well the best films all time ! excellent picture
great script , cast production . this is the movie i never hesistate to recommend people oscars for best original screenplay and kevin spacey supporting actor were well-deserved see it !
for me , it is probably the most brilliant and intelligent movie ever made with such a wonderful cast director . i recommend you to watch kiss'scene listen what they say second degree 'm so chocked john woo dared take subject of this chef d'oeuvre average as mi2 but every one should see film
i agree with all the positive comments about this movie . thing like best is timeless subject matter you know people still act today it would do well for those huge egos margot to look over their shoulder every now and then see who trying creep up take place
i am a bette davis fan , and this is without doubt one of her finest films . she certainly was no beauty but made up for that with pure unmatched talent in the roles played they just don't make em like used too
brilliantly written and directed by joseph mankiewicz , all about eve is one of the most intelligent movies ever . it hardly matters that people probably won't get theatrical allusions ; i certainly didn't read 'all eve' to really behind script performances were superb in fact none performers as good again except for marilyn monroe who played a small but delicious part particularly liked george sanders supremely cynical addison de witt was pulling everybody's strings he deserved his oscar unfortunate bette davis did not receive between anne baxter equally brilliant gloria swanson sunset boulevard vote split went billie holliday (who?) only drawback this movie last scene eve's rooms seemed tacked-on like an afterthought keeping with tone rest
fasten your seatbelts for a great movie ! the dialogue is crisp , acting superb . my favorite bette davis and i have read that was justly proud of her achievement in this film
just a great movie . everybody is so fantastic i would highly recommend seeing it
considered by me and critcs alike as one of the best movies ever made . bette davis is simply brilliant supporting actors actresses superb there's never going to be another film like it truely a classic in every sense word !
a very good movie . bette davis plays famous stage actress margo channing eve is young want to be who claims huge fan of she even charms her way into channings life by moving in with as an assistant time goes and we see that not the sweet doting pretends it turns out wants will stop at nothing get what great getting older margo{ if you can call 40 old!}who trusted was later betrayed marilyn monroe has small role too all actors are their roles little long but
a magnificent movie on every level . crackling script , superb acting just unrivaled and unparalled i recommend the book all about eve
incredibly witty with amazing performance by bette davis .
the greatest screenplay ever !
bette davis' finest role . a must see film for fans of drama with strong female characters watch young marily monroe in small part
bette davis is the queen . best actress ever
why this classic is not in the top five i cannot imagine . all 3 stars should have won oscars that year incredible macmurray and robinson were even nominated , was bing crosby barry fitzgerald won! ! another miscarriage of justice barbara stanwyck losing to grossly overrated bergman
this is a classic that won't disappoint you . top 15 for sure
this is why they are called classics  . double indemnity white hot it noir at its best and rest assured film will make a lasting impression on you minimum lifelong barbara stanwyck fan talk about femme fatale ! mcmurray play off each other in way that seems much more contemporary considering how long ago was made stands the test of time true classic
a very well written movie , the cast really fit part and acting was great.i liked ending how it all came together .
i'm crazy about you , baby ! says fred macmurray passionately to barbara stanwyck . this may explain why he throws caution the wind develop an ingenious plot murder her husband and collect insurance money kind of thriller typically described as atmospheric  double indemnity is a satisfying tale suspense with wonderful performances from two leads ever-reliable edward g robinson billy wilder directs skillfully miklos rozsa supplies brooding musical score has some moments - not be missed
wow , i can't believe am the only person as of yet to review this film ! it is a classic and one best in noir genre . crawford stunning murder deceit going from housewife baking pies make money spoil her ungreatful daughter veda becoming an ambitious owner successful chain restaurants we see evolution character that so exciting watch end comes all soon along way mildred (crawford) meets wonderfully charming man( monty ) who sells his place she can open first restaurant two become involved with another but once success he doesnt have problem taking "tips" hates anything smells "of grease" spends mothers hard earned ease becomes even more nightmare then was before fun for working living no spending earnings ends relationship after leaves ( marries couple days get 10,000 check on false grounds became pregnant wedding night kickes out rightly because surviving wants come back home if gives him third share company turns be mistake left scraps built own hands result did ? husband don't want suprise said quite alot about already say my favorite movies time at you enjoyed checkout crawfords rather less known "a womans face" which opinion finest
boo was the best !
imo the original movies are so much better than remakes . if you have never seen this , do yourself a favor and rent it tension feel from movie will set on edge of your seat
i actually played fonda's role in a school play . defintely great movie
aside from paying the all-star cast this has to be one of cheapest 5 star films ever made . almost no props and certainly special effects oh wait , they did simulate a rain storm towards end that might count as an effect but it was probably stage hand with garden hose great acting in movie not garner single nomination for best actor during year which bridge on river kwai witness prosecution also appeared is still surprising nominated picture lost tension toil among readily apparent sweat dripping their foreheads glistening skin due temperature uncooled room summertime new york film uncomfortable watch decision each man faced very engaging whose basic premise nothing more than against odds extermely well done true classic powerful expose what good making can modern makers should go back review
this movie was so great ! fonda uses logic to make sure justice is done-innocent until proven guilty
one of the greatest movies ever made and its a shame it didn't make afi's 100 best list . terrific script excellent acting 12 angry men timeless classic.the whole movie takes place in room still hold your attention!brilliant !
best film i ever seen and don't usually like henry fonca
great character study with a superb cast . if you want movie action , thrills suspense and romance then won't find it here but acting storyline that will make think this is for the starred henry fonda who works hard to convince some jurors murder case not so clear cut are who's of actors- martin balsam lee j cobb john fiedler ed begley jack warden klugman more stand-out classic film
call me a sucker for films that take place within an enclosed environment , because this film along with many others of its kind is one my absolute favorite movies . fueled emotion and running primarily on the performances actors twelve angry men excellent example different fascettes human condition coincidence possible no matter how fantastic proves it
one of the best examples ensemble acting on film , headed by ever-reliable henry fonda (who was also producers film) . wonderfully controlled (and confined) sense direction often underrated veteran sidney lumet (the verdict network)
a magnificent movie that toally whole heartedly rocks . probably the best court room drama ever it has superb acting by screen greats ; henry fonda , jack warden lee j cobb and martin balsam though is set in jury besides 12 jurors only 3 other main faces one fabulous script perfect amazingly realistic to total 5 star fair
#6 wow , this would be in my top 20 but im glad to see it high though . fantastic screenplay 12 guys sitting a room for an hour and half it's compelling !
a trully brilliant film . i saw it for the first time in government class 8th grade , and has been my all favorite ever since debate arguments analysis of evidence overall psychological drama fell love with this convinced me that wanted to become an attorney understand there is play form where could find ?
awesome movie . very suspensful its a one of kind if you havent seen this then i suggest renting it kevin spacey's best ever
this is a classic movie in the philosophy of using minimum sets (obviously) . it basically story signifying importance holding one's convictions even face complete opposition when one believes they are right , and may have perception perspective which others be lacking also art persuasion towards own point view all characters excellently cast very good worthwhile
we had to read the play for school and i think it was really fun getting in characters .
an incredible , no frills masterpiece !
12 angry men follows the court case of a young boy who is accused murdering his father . extremely well acted with henry fonda as sole questioner boy's guilt until end entire movie takes plae in one room
this film has excellent cinematography and builds suspense . the characters are well developed raises issues of justice really makes audience think about details crime
you wouldn't think a whole movie about jury room could be interesting . it isn't.. it's amazing ! highly recommended
i feel so claustraphobic every time watch that movie
there should be more movies like this -- stories of courageous individuals standing up to group think or complacent norms . shawshank redemption is my favorite these , but belongs in the same category
i just loved the retrospective story board . marky mark
when first watching this movie , afficionados often ask themselves what's so great about 'citizen kane' ? but deserves its lofty perch in the annals of moviedom for several reasons that it took risks being created . was no secret orson welles's classic a thinly-veiled account on life multi-millionaire publisher and yellow journalism extraordinaire william randolph hearst tried to stop making with threats went far as not allow any advertising newspaper (and possibly costing an oscar) secondly cinematography innovative much shot at (at time) unorthodox angles welles sought show his characters both physical emotional perspective thirdly did something unimaginable time : beginning actually end from kane's deathbed scene which he utters rosebud is recounting events by co-operatives gives clues identity effect interactive where audience treated what type inquiry arguably greatest ever confirmed then twenty-five year old monniker 'boy genius'
a masterwork . flawless script , brilliant cinematography and editing incredible performances not surprising that with first film this welles could never equal it arguably the greatest ever update : seraph to be unkind but movie is meant for adults teenagers
a visualy stunning film  ! wonderfully entertaining . i never tire of seeing this - there is always something new that you discover with every viewing thats the hallmark great
in years to come people will study this like we do shakespeare...god the future be more fun
this is one of those movies i never get tired , and loved orson wells . sad ending
this movie , without a doubt is the best . whole people where telling about there expereince with kane very whealty man who on his deathbed only thing mind was childhood toy rosebud
very thought provoking and easy to see why it has been rated 1 by the afi .
directed , produced and co-wrote by orson welles citizen kane (1941) is considered many professional critics as the best american film ever made . for uninitiated story follows reporter jerry thompson (william alland) who assigned task of determining meaning final words (ie rosebud) charles foster (welles) traces life from childhood to media mogul through failed political ambitions personal endeavors while was progressive in its non-linear storyline movie groundbreaking cinematography (eg lighting deep focus techniques) largely based on real william randolph hearst tried have destroyed panned it his newspapers bottom line that justifiably admired substantial influence latter directors producers screenwriters
very well done by welles . there is a reason that this movie critically acclaimed as the best ever it introduced wonderful screenplay and excellent cinematography methods to hollywood payed incredible attention details from music lighting lot of symbolism good
orson welles did something in this movie that had never been done before . he broke the rules refused to follow all filmic techniques and shot how wanted it with no regard for people was making about film merciliessly bombards pseudo-figure charles foster kane character flaws disgrace real life , william randolph hearst none pleased portrayl barred from winning any major award at oscars because of contraversy surrounding (hearst controlled several publications which contributed anti-kane movement) has since praised by critics audiences alike its dynamic story-telling experimental camera work is truly a masterpiece deafening beauty elegance welles' perfomance as seems so effortless hsi supporting cast marvelous what makes astonishing first
citizen kane is a cinema work of art . it's masterpiece they just don't make movies like this one anymore furthermore must admire not only orson welles talent and geniousness but how young he was when made the film many people in their 20's were making films that would history ? story timeless charles foster goes from rags to riches you could say , never really finds happiness man despite his wealth power secure movie works on so levels because great storyline wonderful cast with joseph cotton everett sloan agnes moorehead ray collins ruth warrick,and dorothy comingore welle's genius lighting camera it should be see for any fan
the best !
i'll spell it out for you : a-m-a-z-i-n-g .
the undisputed giant of all movies . every money made after this owes a debt gratitude to orson welles' hypnotic genius only 'touch evil' and 'the magnificent ambersons' come close trailblazer try see it in theater , like great should be seen..
the greatest movie ever made . period it doesn't get any better than this no film has had more influence , impact study and it's not undeserved direction is fluid exquisite acting pitch perfect cinematography oh might be best in #1 on everbody's list thats as should
there are many great films out , but i can only be sure of three that the greatest all-time . citizen kane is one them no way you over-estimate influence this film has had on movies from its revolutionary narrative structure to immensely innovative camera tricks offered a glimpse into real world at time when were still creating alternate ones orson welles was truly visionary he along with such greats as alfred hitchcock john ford and d.w griffith perfected motion picture made it an art form fashioned what evolved today ever
welles is a genius when it comes to film , this was an awsome movie ! not for the impatiant but if you wait till end and actually think about it's ingenius one of my favorites
a lot of people will tell you this is the greatest movie ever made -- for once they're right . i won't attempt to dissect film , others have done that far better than could only state it great story not been told in more brilliant or insightful manner some see and simply understand them truly feel sorry masterpiece
the best american motion picture of them all ! not gone with wind , casablanaca wizard oz . this film takes cake orson welles can only be described as a genius technical aspect but showmanship well i advise everyone to go out and rent buy dvd it has one dvds there
a brilliant film.. . the textbook on poetic imagery certainly , and ironically greatest use uf cinematic expressionism in history brialliantly done every level beautiful mournful entrancing
one of my favorite movies all time , this film noir mystery/action movie could not have been done better . gabriel byrne stars very well in but he is also excellently supported by kevin spacey benicio del toro and pollack the plot was near flawless setting excellent characters while being deep are more than adequate to carry through its finish bryan singer did a wonderful job with direction mystique surrounding may cause new viewer predict ending now i found be unpredictable brilliantly finished
the american film institute calls citizen kane greatest movie of all time . would you ? i most definately ! what amazes me is how a man like orson welles , twenty five year old inexperienced could walk into studio rko and take complete control over entire production sure made right decision because masterpiece it's had he not gotten his way this be great it truly amazing
a great movie
of course , can we say anything about this film that hasn't been said ? the revolutinary contribution welles made to medium cinema with citizen kane has widely acknowledged and i concur but think what are sorely lacking is discussion over just how damn fine charismatic himself was wow it me or young a sexy monkey
orson welles is the reason this movie so great . it a dark , dismal and tragic but tells story of rise fall from power masterfully signifies that no matter who man in life society will pick him apart when he dead if only to put itself upon higher pedestal more eccentric better obviously portray's william randolph hearst tour through his 'castle' bears out fact 'critics' (those are paid rate movies best al time
citizen kane certainly is an exquisite film (flawless and mesmerizing) although welles contributed to the greatly , he didn't do it by himself . depth of also credit cinematographer gregg toland original script idea herman j mankiewicz perhaps we should tip our hats fate luck whatever that these three brilliant men were not only living at same time but brought together create this masterpiece another thing most interesting about anyone who has viewed almost was real life howard roark (the fountainhead) : personification artistic integrity genius during after making fought uphill battle finish screen being a obvious parody william randolph hearst therefore labeled 'case-sensitive' those under his thumb tried buy picture just destroy lesser would have caved kind power ! me great highest degree nor director be able view reminder there place in world for youthful idealism
orsen wells was a genius and an artistic trail blazer . most of his movies , including citizen kane  were way ahead their time - fascinating from beginning to end another great one is the magnificent ambersons look at industrial america life 19th century
i finally saw this movie and it was awesome!! ! think what put the icing on cake kevin spacey.. . he played his character so well i'm gonna name my dog verbal
easilly the best movie ever . cinema`s greater masterpiece why didn`t welles win an oscar with this movie???? ?
a beautifully filmed glimpse into the life of hearst , man with plan but no love . lost in big castle hollowness and fading resolve we search for meaning it fades flames
just a great movie . cinematography and story with history
watch this movie several times- you will pick up something new every time . it makes people think
in a local newspaper this was rated the best movie ever made .
great movie ! one of the all time classics .
when i was younger , thought life couldn't possibly be long enough to watch the movie more than once . since then i've seen it four or five times and each time found something new
a masterpiece .
citzen kane is an unsurpassed masterpiece that remains forever ahead of its time . the stunning performance orsen wells as charles foster a thing beauty to behold and joy recall this movie brought movie-making out infancy benchmark by which all other movies are judged
i have just one word to say . rosebud
this is generally considered the best movie ever made .
citizen kane is one of the all time greatest films . it introduced many new filmmaking techniques
this is a true blockbuster . see if you agree with me that the climax of film massacre scene arthur kennedy saying , jesus wept ! film-maker does good job developing character one weird set brits arabist
stunning film . spectacular 70mm photography , wonderful cast this is truly one of the great films see desert sun in and it becomes a character too fim by director
fantastic movie , scenery music.... . 5 all the way!!! !
i have seen this movie more than twenty times and could see it ! besides the fact that film has an incredible plot , a sharp script expert direction brilliant acting awe-inspiriring score : let's not forget editing roundup interrogation room scenes are editor's wet dream last ten minutes of was exhilerating especially one shot kevin walking like cripple then normal god breathtaking!!! won best original screenplay supporting actor for but deserved to win so much
it may not be factual , but visually there is no movie that can touch . and that's what motion pictures are really all about
cannot avoid watching it over and whenever comes on tv . captivating scenes , music background the stars of that day starting omar sharif this out africa gone with wind dances wolves in harms way longest more stand as keepers my book does anyone know shooting/edit goof (royale) made pulp fiction ? when you watch again for bullet holes to appear wall scene before guns were fired missed samuel l jackson provided his miracle larry a
powerful and rich portrait of t.e . lawrence , one the deepest character portraits in cinema i love way you see him coming unglued during some violent scenes superb music score
i'm not really sure why i like this movie . i've seen it many times , and still can't quite put my finger on - there's something underneath the surface of script bubbling up from sand arabia very homoerotic it's an all-male which think is they cast o'toole to give a feminine edge turkish bath scene his rape are infamous were ahead their time for shock value adult content lean turned not-so-interesting story into sweeping epic extravaganza lump one with bridge over river kwai dumb arrogant brits in foreign lands
this was the first david lean film i've ever seen and so far best . has a real talent of making shocking moment , which he did in several times bridge on river kwai i shocked at greatness my #3 movie (surpassed only by godfather pulp fiction) wow ! see
director david lean's greatest strength in film making is to make you feel the climate . i felt hot and thirsty watching this just like dr zhivago will cold
this is by far the greatest movie of all time and david leans best film . a biography enigmatic t.e lawrence desert loving englishman who united arab tribes in battle against ottoman turks during ww1 at center sun-drenched , 70mm canvas young peter o'toole (lawrence) his debut actors gave great performances especially omar sharif anthony quinn performance freddie youngs cinematography was spectacular making it seem as if alive most striking scene when ali (omar sharif) introduced tiny dot on horizon that steadily enlarges he gets closer has to be watched widescreen directors cut version much better than edited
this movie was so witty and clever . kevin spacey couldn't have done a better job at playing the part , i can truly say did not waste any of my time point in there wasn't one scene which bored anxious to find out who big bad guy  :o)
i think this will be one of the all time great movie ever made . david lean's yet another masterpiece after bridge across river kwai  excellent portrayal a man lawrence who defies barriers in uniting waring arab's under fold he makes foundation nation for them peter'o toole does an extra-ordinary job as lawrence(unbelievable that his debut film - how did miss academy award) anthony quinn , alec guiness and jack hawkins omar shariff-full credit to their outstanding performance no wonder it won 7 awards see restored version extra footage would recommend golden collection
my favourite movie of all time ! and i have been watching movies for 58 years . can also relate to the film its location as worked in saudi arabia 20 travelled extensively on off job.including a visit acabah personally drove along track from jordan medina hejaz railway seen trains which lawrence derailed.which are still lying there this day lots photos video proof.i found sand brass cartridge cases his battle areas.i retired dorset when left by coincidence lived just few miles where came motor bike he is buried.anyone who organise arabs way did.has be very special person.i know , training department large arabian oil company
i put this movie in my personal list of the top three all time....script , camera work acting direction location and outstanding . film has it am amazed at how held up after forty or so years
imagine some very unlikly person going to arabia , and uniting many warring arab tribes into one force (the united republic) against a common foe ! the turks well that's what this great movie is about . they crossed sainai dessert take back from acaca on sea canons of acaba were fixed toward can't be turned around since never expected an attack that deadly when told ya cross with children lawrence said why not ? moses did (only went opposite way.)so if david lean ever meant location as important any characters it caught film tall spindly desert tornado right there for all see original video release was bit choppy story loose ends tied restored version where had in hand extra footage but sound actors speaking everyone filming still alive thay managed perfect lean's vision psychologically satisfying rent it!
peter o'toole is beautiful . this movie's cinematography mind blowing also shows how a nation's greed (england) underscores any and all their actions
i loved this classic . just an epic movie , it showed me a different kind of culture and way acting
one of my all time favorites . the lead actor did wonderfully and i loved philosophical points made throughout movie
this is a fantastic movie . the studio that produced matrix , in an interview for wired magazine considered it to be one of their biggest influences could explain obvious similarities between rooftop chase scenes both films ? i guess wachowski brothers like hitchcock
one of the most twisted (and brilliant) movies ever .
my all time favoite suspense movie ! kevin spacey is superb as verbal kint , a character you will never forget . and of course can't ignore the oscar caliber performance gabriel byrne dean keaton ending one that can be forgotten even by most jaded critics must see
not only one of the greatest films all-time but love stories all time . intriguing part is that it unclear what jimmy stewart in with woman or illusion hitch keeps his characters and viewer constant disorientation best film soundtrack also incredibly haunting
hitchcocks best film . stewart's performance worth seeing several times the closing camera work , as stewart descends tower cured of vertigo is brilliant
greatest hitchcock film . absolutley remarkable
this is one of the best , if not alfred hitchcock's movies . a must-see for hitchcock fans
one of hitchcock's most studied and talked about films . a fascinating movie that seems to be ghostly possession , but then turns out much more although jimmy stewart is in every scene this film you can hear his heart beating frame the very personal statement nature reality illusions we make for ourselves feelings women truly great neccesitates multiple viewings
the best film ever made , all in it is insuperable
alfred hitchcock made many a great film , but if you are looking for the deepest example of his own artistic expression and personal fetishes vertigo is to see . very mysterious other-worldly almost feel as in dream vibrant colors at once soothing can be uneasy times downright cruel ghosts spirits hitchcock's dreams displayed with startling perfection this one most important works cinema
bash those nazis
they don't come much better than this.amazing to think,given the film's now soaring reputation,that vertigo was generally passed over,and hitch not even oscar-nominated,when it first released.it has so depth,rewards repeated viewings;is loaded with typically fascinating psycho-sexual insights;beguilingly mysterious and sensuous;gorgeously photographed by robert burks;makes brilliant use of san francisco locations;jimmy stewart unusually ambiguous in surely his finest performance(as phobic,increasingly obsessive ex-cop);innovative special effects;an audaciously premature revelation;superlative,expressive colour.a feast for mind senses:an artistic masterpiece riveting entertainment !
yes , you guys are on the money ! top 15 of all time jimmy stewart and hitchy amazing ruby is there something wrong with a director being an artist!! quote artist like its bad thing . do go out to movies just get quick laugh or scare be entertained think films that try art stupid???? ? well they j/k criticize film for artistic absurd
although somewhat slow (one of hitchcock's greatests techniques for creating suspense) , vertigo is the most humane and extremely personal movie ever made . it took me a few times to truly see brilliance this so i wouldn't be surprised if first-time viewers were dissappointed with definately one top 5 greatest films all-time
if you watch this film and focus on the point of view female characters will see suffering . jeez , scottie ferguson was plagued with vertigo but look what he did to women in his life idolized wife client so much that made her unreal manipulated played emotions poor girl found take place including coaxing mimic physical image lost idol not mention assistant who clings every word while helping him through trauma knowing she can never hope turn head is an exercise misogyny intense beautifully directed by alfred hitchcock
i was completely blown away on several levels by this hitchcock classic the first time saw it many years ago . though he an undeniably eclectic actor who brought to life characters from george bailey elwood p dowd and everything in between during his long career , part still seemed fairly offbeat for jimmy stewart yet per usual did excellent job giving us one very confused individual embodied all internal fear sexual tension repression that seems be underlying theme so thrillers kim novak may have lacked stewart's range overall but a good choice her role as well she conveyed just right combination of beauty eccentric mental ambiguity make character both integral story fascinating love interest scottie ferguson is film will challenge your intellect keep you edge seat
classic hitchcock ! he simply has no equal superb directing , and casting all around .
alfred hitchcock is a genious . an undeniable to all the people unfamiliar with his work and wondering why he hailed as such should just watch this movie they will understand last scene so stirred me-the way blended ironicies of good evil was purely brilliant when nun emerged from stairs into darkness , she appeared ominious being only come light-a symbol rightiousness good-and have deal death that inadvertantly caused..wow rest subtley crafted be gloriously unsettling well ; it's defiently near top my favoritie hitchock movies
vertigo is , without a doubt the pinnacle of alfred hitchcock's film career and probably greatest ever made ! it whirpool obsession that holds you spellbound from start to finish what better leading players than america's every man james stewart biluptuous kim novak ? movies don't come like this anymore .
hitchcock ! i think this was the 1st movie saw and it sucked me right in .
james stewart is caught in the middle of an alfred hitchcock classic based bay area and san francisco . mr a detective called upon to investigate wealthy man's wife who has mysteriously died , however up twisted plot love deception as dead inexplicably reappears from time even stranger enters his life highly recommended for those enjoy good twist
i have never seen a thriller so amazing such as the usual suspects . it is brilliant , well directed and cinematically edited film kevin spacey's performance excellent probably even one of his best this also contain some unforgivable phrases that are truely but thing really extraordinary in its astonishing ending which almost certainly ever clearly must-see ; more than twice..
i want to do a vertigo tour of san francisco- i'm sure there's one out there already ! you can watch this movie over and because hitchcock's layered in so many little details that hint where the story's going- just might not see them all at first . psychoanalysis was never put more intriguing use..
one of hitchcock's most influential and perspective altering movies ; truly showed the emotional power moving image
a stage play adapted very well to the screen . fine cast , led by grant in bravura over top performance make this one of funniest movies ever made even perhaps especially on repeat viewings hell its halloween i think i'll watch it tonight
when you really sit down and think about the subject , this one will eventually show up in anyone's top twenty . dated ? here there but not where it counts most don't let lack of color throw either ; it's shot with that almost-frankenstein air dread chilling backlighting lends revulsive suspense to what should be a loony romp (adding its unique nature) wonderful cast cary grant at his manic best as turncoat bachelor who spends wearisome day dealing hesitant fiancee two mentally-cracked aunts penchant for serving tainted elderberry wine brother presidential identity problems return psychotic prodigal (played gruesome gusto by ray massey) along supporting includes peter lorre reluctant henchman dr einstein western saddletramp bit player jack carson dimwitted would-be playwright cop you'll find murder madness have never been funnier (how gets sign himself into happydale rest home is legendary twist linguistics even impresses harried police chief) spacious set (a tip hat broadway origins) ties action (!) together keeps audience involved 40s scream plays well
this is where i picked up my love for black comedy . and the war of roses are favorite dark comedies never have two sweet old things made murder so laughable
charge! ! brilliant . well acted and keeps you interested from start to finish cary grant at his best the two old ladies are teddy is just whacky enough make it work ijr says check out
a classic from 1944 , this farcical comedy is one of the best theatrical features all time . although plot involving discovery dead people might seem grizly to some it done so tastefully and twists are wonderfully unexpected that hardly noticable performances across board great here but cary grant's over-the-top double-take-filled performance certaintly highlight there also alot slapstick dumb characters which add fun ending as crazy rest movie making viewing experience much more satisfying
funniest movie of all
a very clever movie that actually makes you think - and keeps guessing . kevin spacey is fantastic as verbal pete postlethwaite at his usual high standard acting the juxta postioning suspense even greater your mind ticking over my favourite part end where leaves policeman works case out by looking noticeboard everything said was on there had voiceover absolutely film to treasure
if you have never seen this , should give yourself a treat and rent it . is so funny cary grant absolutely terrific in his part
what a great movie . cary grant is so funny that i turn purple every single time watch the love his quick faces when he stumbling on to say those poor old ladies it was just down right and pure entertainment ! teddy best charecter ever in whole believe one of greatest charecters been made
plainly put , this movie is a lot of fun ! it silly 1940's style farce at it's best . still very funny remnant much kinder more innocent time in 1947 the idea seemingly harmless people committing murder was own way because so far removed from reality 2002 just as likely not to be day's headlines how sad arsenic and old lace  however anything but based on successful broadway show by joseph kesselring tells story abby martha brewster (jean adair josephine hull) two sweet ladies who are angels mercy sick needy their brooklyn neighborhood advertise rooms for rent yet never have any lodgers seems though whenever lonely fellow with no family answers ad they sit him down offer glass special elderberry wine--a prime ingredient which (with pinch strychnine) poor gentleman then given proper burial cellar full christain services youngest nephew believes himself president roosevelt panama unfortunate corpse that yellow fever victim add into mix nephews : mortimer (cary grant) charmingly confused happens find out aunts raised offing parlour (he finds body latest window seat accident does some funniest physical comedy film history over it.) truly villainous one named jonathan (raymond massey) along his personal plastic surgeon dr einstein (peter lorre) has come home after 20 years dragging things become increasingly frantic hilarious especially clueless cop (jack carson) wanders tied chair about jonathan's outdone aunts!) true movie's humor dated probably unavoidable that's fifty referrences pretty obscure today's audiences recurring jokes--jonathan's resemblance boris karloff--isn't nearly those aren't familiar karloff's films (in play's original run joke made funnier fact karloff actually played truth pales bit raymond massey doesn't look like karloff.) if you're willing take terms ignore jokes you don't really get (or funny--there few well) can back enjoy great cary grant's most likeable performances he around asking yourself why someone born new york talks an english accent part mad charm
a very dark comedy from the early days of films . cary grant provides all laughs you can supply him with , and rest cast is superb in their supporting roles way they make fun whole idea killing people almost scary definitely see this masterpiece
cary grant proves what a comic genius he is . this one of the funniest movies ever made
the way mystery comes unfolding slowly definitely makes movie better . characters are all unique in that you don't know what happens until end and it is great
fast paced , humorous and a farcical delight . it pulls you in quickly rarely lets go grant is at his best trying to keep all the loose ends tied together touch with brother being teddy roosevelt! ! wonderful story
cary grant is so funny in his acting expressions . those old ladies had tears falling
there may be other versions that are more true to the book , use realistic or hideous makeup special effects have better sets and locations . but i still respect this one as first successful attempt bring shelley s very original imaginative morality play screen boris karloff was also adept at showing us confused anger well sympathetic side of monster using only facial expressions body language who doesn t think classic artistry when you hear word frankenstein ? in 70+ years since movie produced familiar square head stitches bolts tacky suit big shoes become than a costume an old they entered realm american film folklore m sure will productions story future some no doubt done - don any ever totally eclipse
this movie rocked ! no one i knew guessed the ending correctly . kevin spacey is so talented in
a superb example of man's inhumanity to man , and ego . why try perfect god's perfection ? omitted line in the movie was i know what it feels like be god !
dear 'gone away'.....why dont people like you get your facts right when it comes to great movies this . was not myrna loy gloria swanson  ! is pur 'film noir' and a classic anybody who doesn't appreciate the quoted one-liners 'i am big , its pictures that got small !' real movie buff one of then all time films with hollywood poking fun itself true
a story of seedy character (william holden) who becomes the companion to very aged actress (myrna loy) has long been out limelight . she delusions still being beautiful and famous star he uses her him sad depressing , but an excellent film
i love the whole affair between holden and swanson - it all works . perversion of , as spineless gigolo a beverly hills nutcase worked played vamp / victim really beautifully very hard to do right
the classic tale of faded silent film star norma desmond is hilariously funny , and interesting at same time . great performances
billy wilder's greatest creation includes three unforgettable characters all stuck in a terrible , despicable situation . gloria swanson giving the final line right mr demille i'm ready for my closeup is one of great moments cinema this masterpiece shows true callousness hollywood fleeting fancy fame and dangers delusion idealism movies about ever made
this is a film lovers dream.filled with nothing but great,professional performances by the entire cast,a beautiful score,master direction and not to mention one of best if mystery/suspence stories ever put . kevin spacy stands out his oscar winning portrayl verbal crippled criminal in movie as it seems.you get just about everything action,suspense,comedy,mystery,drama my favorite films i garuntee you will love money back mind don't work at video store
there s never been such an acid and wicked attack against hollywood .
the music is wonderful , as storyline .
not a frame or line too many . classic how-to-make-a-comedy script , regarding silly premise perfect casting great editing in the hands of master comedy director
great performances by lemmon , monroe and to everyone's surprise curtis . george raft is as the villain a lot of strong supporting cast
comedy classic ! lemmone and curtis were great . a very well written script definatly reccomended
hysterically funny . the kind of film that made hollywood tony curtis looked so at ease in a dress and pumps
this movie is amazing . the dave matthews and baltimore ravens of movies
this is one of my favorite marilyn movies tony curtis and jack lemmon where great i loved marilyns character . i't was a very funny movie
one of the funniest movies all time
a superb and hilarious movie with underlying sexual themes out being too blunt , over the top or even subtle for that matter . wonderful casting of jack lemmon tony curtis marilyn monroe george raft joe e brown may have energy but is my personal favorite clever witty he does dead on impression cary grant one funniest movies all time
a true classic with an outstanding cast .
this one is still ahead of today . the one-liners and racy dialogue alone are first-rate ! curtis really great as a spoof cary grant - men can learn lot from how he seduces marilyn , believe it or not lemmon also his spastic energy makes movie purr wonderfully i'm amazed at sexual candor like breakfast tiffany's psycho other movies beginning 60s hollywood was just to explore sex in an adult way end line classic anytime you see 2 straight male friends drag (bosom buddies) you're seeing
nobody s perfect , says its famous last laugh . but this scintillating comedy is ! wilder and diamond script which springs out of chicago infamous st valentine day massacre 1929 alarmed bosses who predicted outrage disaster at the time mixing female impersonation romantic murder stretched limits taste genre formula when put together gangsters wise-cracking cross-dressing heroes marilyn monroe he wrought a riot played by an inspired cast key to success - along with vivid characters brilliant performances snappy pace throughout non-stop gags invention twists comic incident flow as joe jerry -brilliant curtis screamingly funny lemmon elude mob boss george raft wriggling into all-girl jazz band josephine daphne legendary drag act taking in amorous adventures seductive deceptions madcap pursuits never wastes explaining obvious one minute for instance affects falsetto on phone line up job sweet sue her society syncopators ; next shot we re following well-muscled calves tottering down railway platform men transformation self-evident more startling it among highlights : sugar singing running wild millionaire osgood tango cary grant engagement announcement while bed shakes his maracas absurd ecstasy masterpiece timing frequently exhibits vulgar streak tempered viennese elegance elevated collaborative mischievous wit summary funniest films ever made!!
justifiably the current #1 in classic movies section,and absolutely greatest ever comedy.scintillating wilder-diamond script,curtis doing his best cary grant impression,monroe(an underrated comic actress)radiant as ever.and late jack lemmon's clearly having a ball . among so many marvellous scenes,i particularly love one where sugar and rest of girl band clamber into bunk on that train ride made heaven.the film's not aged bit;it's priceless.having just seen it for about seventh time,this is case familiarity breeds content
one of kevin spacey's best roles ever . a movie that can keep me guessing the entire way through must be an amazing film this is them
a truly uproarious slapstick comedy from the late 50s , some like it hot provides humor on all ends of spectrum but is never really dirty ! physical verbal jokes subtle flirt and ridicoulous situations . would be almost impossible not to laugh at least once during this classic
marilyn monroe's best performance
definitely one of the best comedies ever . jack lemmon and tony curtis are very impressive , marilyn monroe for once does a good job i would recommend it
billy wilder can do everything .
very funny , lemmon curtis and monroe is superb form . beautiful ditzy hysterical as daphne with josephine ! brilliant writing direction combine beautifully to make this a comedy classic
out of all the choices for classic movies on this site , some like it hot should be #1 . was rated funniest movie ever made every single time at afi awards and deserves full credit it's an extremly funny marilyn monroe does excellent job introduces us to nice crude humor putting men in drag can teaches throughout has great make up effects is pretty high budget seems none outdated
one of the funniest all time . i roared with laughter as a kid and do now grandfather really holds up
tony curtis , jack lemmon and marilyn munroe are great !
this truly is one of the funniest movies ever made . acting , writing and directing just brilliant
perhaps kevin spacey's best , the usual suspects was an amazing movie . for a film filmed on very low budget it incredibly well done viewer is kept guessing throughout and ending one of all time definitely must-see movies 90's
the only classic movie that makes one laugh out loud after repeated viewings ! well deserves all praise it has received .
what a classic !
now this is comedy !
one of the best dialogue driven comedies ever .
was a wonderful romantic comedy.. . sure classic
katharine hepburn and cary grant at their best .
this is one of my favorite movies , i watch it whenever it's on hbo . love katharine hepburn and jimmy stewart in almost anything cary grant at his most alluring when he's doing comedy.(e.g mr blandings builds dream house girl friday bringing up baby-also with hepburn)
this is a first rate film noir thriller . gabriel byrne shines as dean keaton , an ex-cop turned crook reformed businessman and kevin spacey absolutely convincing verbal kint the story engaging brilliant ending will leave you in slack jawed rewind tape to immediately see it again
this film is amazing . how can you go wrong with hepburn and stewart? !
i believe this one may be of kate hepburn's best character , as she's not playing tracy lord she is lord!!!! !
this movie is terrific and extremely funny ! people of generation need to see it .
now this movie was so funny and you never know what gonna happen . i think is one the most funniest court movies ever made lawyer trying to make sense with all that had then punchline at end he would be for next case hillarious couldn't stop laughing if have not seen , will surely love !
i'm absolutely shocked to see that witness for the prosecution has a composite rating of 3.25 ! how could anyone give this classic movie anything but five stars ? it's highly unusual find clever plot , witty dialogue and exceptional acting all in one like . my husband i watched it first time last night we were glued screen there wasn't dull moment entire show especially enjoyed watching hilarious interactions between sir wilfred his nurse various twists turns kept us guessing 'til end which was fun if you haven't seen really should rent
one of the best whodoneits...suitable for any age with laughton , power and dietrich pulling off great performances backed up by a supporting cast solid writing...see it .
bette at her best! !
jimmy stewart was fabulous in this one . it actually portrays an honest politician fighting government corruption only the movies folks
the first of indy films and best . i saw it at theatre when came out , having heard very little was thoroughly entertained great fun some violent scenes so keep away from impressionable ones
this movie can be viewed as a race with the nazis to get atomic bomb , but it doesn't need . music is brilliant action outstanding romance bounces between tragic and cute slide show mood content of plot create an overwhekming sense awe doom indy's intelligence subtle true factor that conflict bewteen god pure evil for fate world had harrison ford never made beside one i am confident he still would regarded greatest stars all time george lucas's influence adds exoticism old pulps spielberg's direction superb how you fail ?
an absolute materpiece . kaiser socay is the greatest villian of all time
this was such a great movie and one of my alltime favorite movies . james stewart always blows me away is chareceter absoultely amazing i would never be able to stand on feet for whole 48 hours it ? just up something he believe in , incredible wish we had more politicians like mr smith our days today !
it gets intense once really going . this is one of james stewart's finest performances his character , jefferson smith a role model for us all he refuses to give up on what believes even in the face major opposition and threat when looked like didn't stand chance winning (of course had some encouragement from frieind too.) thing i think interesting about movie how non-political there no indication political party mr was affiliated with cause fighting neither liberal or conservative done such way that anyone who watched could side him it's just great uplifting well worth seeing
james stewert in his best role ever as a small town do-gooder become politician . he slowly relizes what type of place washington dc is and the flaws our government this still powerful/important film
a wonderful movie dealing with politics and faith in dream . jimmy stewart gives stunning performance as the man who wants something better for american kids
interesting and even inspiring . good for any age great black white film
an amazing movie ! it may seem corny , but this (jimmy stewart's character) is politics as should be--full of ideals and enthusiasm . i think we can make back there some day
in this movie i love how the main character is put a tight squeeze and able to manipulate police by giving them an elaborate story that was totally made up using little details from around interrogation room .
this movie had some of the best stuff from marx brothers . on e my favorites
my all time favorite movie . the marx brothers are in absolute peak form , and if this was only film they ever made would still be legends pay special attention to groucho's dialogue
sexystreif wouldn't know her a** from a hole in the ground . this is perhaps most inspired , densely-packed comedy ever film history ! marx bros are greatest vaudeville team of all-time and was their finest pure all-comedy no filler whatsoever where do i begin ? how about when they all dress up as groucho his bedgown my glass water ok give - your what mirror scene if you didn't enjoy that don't final battle one funniest scenes saw it's also great anti-war movie farce spirit strangelove dictator hands down true comic legends why movies
i'm not normally in to exaggerated and outlandish comedy - unless it's done right ! this one is . it a masterpiece of insanity deflating pompousity
the marx brothers' unique brand of anarchic humour may not be for all tastes,but those you,like me,who are enamoured,this spoof war heroics and sorts -isms(with groucho,would you believe,as president ruritania,harpo chico as spies) surely has to their most inspired hilarious hour(and 10 minutes).the nightgown-mirror scene had me banging on floor in convulsions .
wow!wow !
this was not merely a great film , but an important one . for those too young to remember let me tell you : the cold war damned scary time ! we may simply have been lucky that people in charge of world didn't blow it up kubrick's perhaps first serious artist had nerve view as proper subject satire so doing he gave us all new way looking at central reality our years were never more than half hour away from annihilation -- whether because mechanical error (as fail safe) or deliberate act madman like jack d ripper strangelove very policy government known mutual assured destruction (mad) how much difference there kubrick wanted ask between general and say curtis lemay president muffley johnson ? after seeing impossible take leaders policies face value could no longer ignore man behind curtain real possibility mad ripper's madness times themselves without fully realizing russians movie built doomsday machine truly thing is...it still exists
the best movie out that year . ending was a trip kevin made great you had to watch over and again
released in 1964 , stanley kubrick's dr . strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb is cinema its finest art form while dominant cold war theme a bit dated now film serves practical purpose today namely give genuine feel of what conditions world was under during that time for subsequent generations notwithstanding strong undertones dark humor uninitiated basic story american air force general jack d ripper (sterling hayden) sends attack signal an airborne bomber piloted by maj t.j king kong (slim pickens) capt lionel mandrake (peter sellers) realizes crazy attempts contact president who barricaded room with his advisors hawkish gen buck turgidson (george c scott) ex-nazi as well russian ambassador bull) men debate merits letting chips fall trying doing best fulfill duties nuclear combat toe russkies eventually rides big one down after freeing jammed casting superb sellers playing three parts (originally four until pickens cast which much better) interesting contrast failsafe (1964) has same yet straight color back white comedy bottom line reaches pinnacle remains relevant other similar themed movies are outdated
very good , with strong funny performances tight direction and a script .
one of my all-time faves.not a wrong note in it ! sellers is absolutely , positively without doubt superb his raf officer and doc strangelove characters had me rolling great comic timing you see the beginning kubrick's style with camera backgrounds attention to detail . i was air force 90s things still haven't changed - there really are nuts like that on base squadrons love message behind madness this movie can't be duplicated it's duck soup meets catch 22 or something major kong / bomb/ penis scene talking about postapocalyptic life fantastic whole hand w/ mind its own ex-nazi schtick just speak any higher true genius hell talent he wasn't even comedian by trade
practically perfect in every way . casting , screenplay black and white totally quirky let's face it when you get as many leading actors one film (and they're all at their peak) it's gotta be off the chart !
where the hell is major kong ?
i worship this movie . stanley kubrick , the great artist who made masterpiece sense of ridiculous cold irony that permeates every second it george c scott as buck turgidson is single funniest person in film and everything else well a seriously funny hysterical but with deep dark cynical message satire for ages one greatest films ever
stanley kubrick was an artist , it is quite obvious . he knew exactly how to push the right buttons with dr strangelove pushed as many could and still made a very controversial ludicrous sardonic piece of cinema but we cannot place brilliance film at kubrick's feet alone for there are plenty others who deserve just much credit george c scott brilliant often eccentric u.s general peter sellers in all three roles funny one can get (athough i think better than here) sterling hayden's col ripper so clearly insane hilarious hear him talk soviets draining us our precious fluids course bomb sequence words begin describe insanely over-the-top yet that scene ! great certainly best candidate greatest movies ever
one of the most shocking moments i have ever seen on film is definately cowboy riding bomb . that was incredibly powerful , yet also terrifying still cannot reccomend this enough peter sellers absolutely brilliant and marvelous in it as sterling hayden (surprise surprise recognise him from godfather?) george c scott kubrick pulled off another masterstroke real greatness his films began with dr strangelove went to 2001 : a space oddysey clockwork orange full metal jacket hilarious dark even at times wow he amazing mesmerizing 3 roles say get out summary funniest greatest made
the best satire about war i have seen on film . stanley kubrick is a genius peter sellers acting climax with his multiple roles great visual slim pickens riding hoss to destiny
i've never seen another movie quite like this one . it keeps you guessing the whole time and just when think you've got figured out everything changes by far best ending ever
hysterical comedy on a scary subject . brilliant direction from the master - kubrick performances sellers , scott and hayden are first rate highly recommended
one of the most surreally funny movies ever made . this film was also a well-done jab at extreme right wing hawks and mindless warmongers as far i'm concerned sentiment entire movie could not have been summed up better than it in scene which slim pickens zealously rides bomb to his death - yeeeehawwww !  considering released 1964 , none us need wonder why became popular cult all time
this film is biting , twisted and bloody hilarious ! sterling hayden george c . scott peter sellers are just brilliant
hilarious . peter sellers is the jack-o-all trades doomsday notion so real that i sometimes wonder if some country has got it happening today flying down on bomb a great scene
this movie is just silly and i love it . peter sellers does a hilarious job in all three of his parts has some my favorite images like dr stragelove trying to suppress nazi salute , the insane officer firing belt fed machine gun at own troops yelling feed me !  course cowboy riding icbm overall one time favorites
possibly stanley kubrick's best work , dr . stragelove is a hilarious and brilliant take on the age of atomic weapons saturated with symbolism fantastic performance by peter sellers makes this true classic
a classic stanley kubrick movie , who is incapable of producing bad film . the was both hilarious and poignant reminiscent catch-22 in its satirical yet altogether believable portrayal world militaries
my favorite kubric film . a cold war satire that entertains even today hilarious through and
this movie was very good . it had action , suspense and drama kevin spacey rightfully earned an oscar for his performance the plot line is strong will keep you wondering until end
this movie is one of stanley kubrick's best as it has a great plot characters .
awesome movie by the greatest director af all time .
since kubrick is my favorite director , his commentary on the cold war in dr . stragelove highly ingenous
if tjis is not a testament to today i dont know what
a taut , wicked intense political thriller . frank sinatra laurence harvey and janet leigh give excellent performances angela lansbury is just evil but her performance shines
great movie . superb acting and script if you like tom clancy novels or political thrillers , check out this not particularly appreciated by communist apologists but one of the all-time movies really amazing thing is that hollywood made it even back in 1962
it's a stretch to find grace kelly and coop tying the knot but story is tense exciting . i guess in west , such vast difference age was not uncommon real time moving of clock classic score terrific cameos slew character actors really add it won well deserved oscar
those who see this movie as just another good versus evil are missing the point . is about doing your duty and acting with integrity out of cowardly self interest an entire town turns it's back on will kain , including his deputy in hour need even new wife ready to abandon him because she won't try understand why he feels must stay face frank miller has vowed kill one person understands helen ramirez away only people stand a drunk boy gary cooper acts part wonderfully you can feel quiet desperation doubt realizes that have fight alone against four men when finally be sits office write what follows simply finest montages anywhere cinema clock ticks toward high noon music builds we faces all abandoned tension until it broken by whistle train result foregone conclusion but doesn't matter time gunfight begins story essentially over except avowed pacifist kills bad guys rather than her husband killed last scene perfect where looks at crowd gathered after tosses marshal's star ground contempt rides silently best western ever made searchers unforgiven (sorry clint)
good vs . evil has never been done simpler-or better
another classic . one of the best endings i've seen kevin spacey has a breakthrough performance
i love,love,love this movie , and i'm not a huge pre-eastwood western fan . however the clever use of clocks real time utter cowardice town gripping sense suspense (eastwood's high plains drifter copped lot this) cooper's fantastic performance all make classic ending when he throws down badge in disgust had me cheering hated that after went through for them including his wife ex-girlfriend you see things like so much world - noon really hit home it left questioning if is worth saving normal 50s flick !
a quintessential western/suspense story . the idea to have film take place within itself (the length of dictates how much time marshall has until high noon) was absolutely brilliant on part producers and course , there is grace kelly in her lead role looking sounding as best she's ever been performance noon one movie history
excellent acting , beautiful b w cinematography superb editing great directing and an all-too-fitting song . this film is so very simple yet
direct,simple western;but a great political film at the same time,one of best in timing all history cinema(it happens real time  .
arguably the most evil character in movie history
charles laughton's only film as director(from 1955) is a once-neglected,now much cherished , fairytale fantasy/ allegorical suspense thriller- an unconventional genre mix-,which manages to be atmospheric and terrifying,as well supremely lyrical poetic.robert mitchum stars evil phoney preacher preying on widow her children gain fortune hidden their property.memorable not for his tremendous performance,but in particular stanley cortez' peerless photography,with the children's moonlit river journey great highlight of american cinema.voted all-time #3 1989 time out poll,all-time #4 by german critics 1995 ; definite must-see .
i saw this movie because all my friends were telling me to see it . was awesome not only the plot clean , but characters perfect for they did a great job at manipulating everything and making you think something else
a must see thriller . robert mitchum is at nearly his best in this spooky chill-fest shelley winters also stars film has some truly fantastic sequences , and makes you totally freak out when hear singing the hymn leaning on everlasting arms  definitely it will not be dissapointed
spellbinding .
this film porves that the academy awards don't mean a thing for night of hunter wasn't even nominated single oscar .
you've probably read the synopsis of movie from marquis , but what it doesn't say is that this a fantasy adventure . smacks darkest tales brothers grimm and preaches lesson innocent children will prevail over thoroughly evil adults okay so they have some help fairy godmother win harry powell shown to be coward we all knew him laughton directed tale with elements dash berthold brecht's german theater was art ? sure ! did go heads american audiences in 1959 you bet if can get into mood film you'll enjoy every scene deserves second look
the only directorial effort of actor charles laughton is a masterpiece . robert mitchum gives daring portrayal insane , murderous preacher harry powell relentlessly hunting two innocent children across depression era bible belt to get their father's stolen fortune despite films complete lack academy award nominations its photography and music as well directing acting are exceptional this chilling suspense film noir truly compelling terrifying
great music , themes and a young natalie wood . can't go wrong
leonard bernstein's magnificent setting of romeo and juliet . it is possibly as well known in the u.s shakespeare play on which based contains some finest music ever composed for a musical , with tunes are engaging memorable contrapuntal brilliantly orchestrated an amazing tour-de-force by one most talented musicians to live
one of my favorite movies all time . i love leonard bernstein's score and sondheim's lyrics everything worked for this movie
the movie 'the warriors was popular when my kids were teens so i thought it a good idea to show them gang related from era . needless say , still haven,t lived down as sons found very corny in high school,every boy wearing purple shirt after that came out it,s tough get old !
definitely the best musical ever made ! natalie wood is amazing
west side story is a truly wonderful film . everything from the performances , to dance numbers songs directing just fantastic as far i'm concerned it best musical ever made running neck-and-neck with wizard of oz simply !
this is a very good romantic modern day version of romeo juliet . it has sad ending and lots songs i just wish tony maria could have found way to be together
a modern day romeo and juliet . wonderful movie that has romance , good music heartbreaking at the end.i think this even lessons about what happens with hatred.i still find myself rooting for tony maria wishing ending could be different they together
a great musical !
my all time favorite movie . kevin spacey is amazing ! great story , plot everything the acting superb best ever
one of the greatest love stories all time .
a very nice movie that had lot of dancing and was great to watch . the portrayed history happening during period time
it is a topical (well , was at the time) well constructed story that dealt with problems america just beginning to come terms with- gangs and racial prejudice! ! plus score hip daddio i liked taken from shakespeare modernized . still sing songs
great musical movie . i enjoy how the guys can sing and still act macho in good acting funny yet sad
west side story i liked because it was a of love with different culture two groups people or gangs that didn't get along but for the between boy and girl . had good singing dancing , at its best just as compelling
ahhh , the most wonderful movie
took the american musical movie in new directions . did you know stephen sondheim wrote lyrics ?
i love the music in west side story . also , it's a great romance
i saw this movie a bit back , but remember that it had great ending . the story kept me intact with on cable tv so now i'm wondering when they will play again
this is the best movie musical ever made even though natalie wood was lip-synching .
i agree with lily -- the music is awesome which shocking , since normally hate musicals . but story so compelling it takes you in plus it's a fascinating timepiece without seeming too dated
best movie of the 1930's . wonderful fantasy which remains fresh after seven decades top direction , acting and makeup bring bizarre characters monster bride pretorius to life once seen they are never forgotten undergirded given depth by touching on timeless philosophical questions--the relationship man creation (and a creator?) purpose moral responsibility science society's treatment rejects or outsiders even nature core religion yokes humor pathos like few movies
actually , this was better than the first one with elements of humor thrown in scares . director and stars manage to convincingly portray monster as something be pitied that's not easy do it's really sad a way watch final scene where his bride rejects him because all he wanted loved
more than just a horror flick - great film speaks volumes about society . absolute classic every time she screams in panic when looking at him i'm on the monster's side -whenever villagers run fear his ! it's entirely unrational , but i can't help it rejection hurts
one of the few sequels better than original . those films that make you say wow after watch it
james whale was certainly a god-send . i truly believe that he is one of the most influential directors ever never has film been so expectedly scary while at same time unexpectedly funny ! bride pulls it off with great precision , and only talents could have made brilliantly to this day belive frankenstein be greatest all horror films
kevin spacey is the greatest actor , and he does some of his finest work in this movie . thrilling action packed ! it's great for everyone
not just a great horror movie but . anyone should enjoy this whether they're into the genre or it has timeless suspense , warmth and humor alone...bad...friend...good !
this sequel,in which dr frankenstein resuscitates the monster and creates a (less than enraptured)mate for him , is even better landmark original- tirelessly inventive visual feast full of atmosphere,macabre wit,expressionist lighting,and spiced with touch poetry pathos.it puts most modern horror films to shame.incidentally,boris karloff,who played monster,was dignified,old-fashioned english gentleman,while underrated director james whale portrayed in recent,much admired gods monsters  .
unquestionably the greatest horror film of all time ! everything from performances to franz waxman's beautiful score james whale's oscar-worthy direction is truly astounding bride frankenstein a true classic and one movies ever made , in my opinion .
great , probably the best of this type movie hollywood has came up with... .
the best historical drama ever produced . naval battle was spectacular  ! chariot race - one of scenes
i would put ben-hur in my top 15 . the movie was incredible , particularly chariot race and scene with slaves rowing ship faster however did not like ending feel that end (spoiler coming up) made a pro-religious statement by curing everyone said jesus son of god could magically cure people before this portrayed as great guy but make religious at latest have ended film if were william wyler when judah gave water to powerful moment
the greatest religious historical movie ever made . a long but captivating film about evil roman empire and rise of christianity directors william wylers masterpiece
a masterpiece movie made of lew wallace story love,belief and dedication . i have seen this now more than 10 times every time feel see that for the first charleton heston(judah benhur)does splendid leading role stephen boyd makes an excellent supporting those 20 minutes chariot race will put everybody on edge their seat.i think be one all great biblical theme in big screens
ben hur is the classic tale of one man's spiritual quest and hell he had to endure complete it . also a deeply moving masterful tribute by author lew wallace faith , love salvation as well best most enduring examples christian fiction ever written i'm not big heston fan but i have admit really did an excellent job in this film what was possibly role his career took judah on very believable journey from lofty heights wealthy aristocrat depths galley slave back again watch movie every time chance each do find - especially final scenes first
the same people who rate 'scary movie' greatest of all time , this movie terrible (i doubt if they have even seen it)....glad i am not in with bunch....stephen boyd (does anyone remember he also starred on 'fantastic voyage' (anyone see this?)is absolutely excellent.. . another top performance by charlton heston good writing direction score....have about 8 times..
awesome movie ! incredibly entertaining .
ben hur was a revolutionary movie with respect to special effects featured in it . most notably , the sea battle and warrior cart scenes are outstanding of course considered from our turn century point view those may seem 'primative' (bad word) but as whole counts one significant history also by depicting biblical events historical surroundings very attractive way
ben hur was an incredible master-piece . heston deserves all the accolades possible for his powerful role in this move
a movie that makes you think . no formula here , excellent plot twist at the end for those looking regular mix of gunplay and explosions this won't disappoint
in the horror film genre , this is a reigning champ . i have never been fan of so called "slasher" movies that contain no psychological angst but rather anticipation girl to fall forest ( which she always does ) and gets well you know... what ever happened baby jane we see two dynamic legendary actresses displaying best there couse feuding between them real life only enhances fire extremely thought out performances by these ladies fantastic bette davis' face alone could scare h**l anyone joan wonderful as tormented bedridden sister through collection horrible circumstances are ultimately lead an ending makes us all contemplate "what will happen now?" personally love aspect filmaking don't like be told think or given nice neat little package feel comfortable with disturbing davis singing inhances would recommend movie any lover 5 stars iconic who's light still shines just brightley !
bette davis and joan crawford did not share a mutual love for one another off screen , but the two of them together on was fierce combination . you go through this movie thinking baby jane is only evil to find out good sister hasn't always been so
what's not to like about bette davis chewing up scenery and making joan crawford miserable ? fantastic movie . great performances by all concerned
this movie is actually scarier than the horror films of today , which have a lot more graphic and gratuitous violence . bette davis terrifying as vicious caretaker her invalid sister-the scene where she serves sister dinner cooked parakeets(her sister's pets) frighening horrifying indeed chews up scenery loony-toons who despises sibling joan crawford (of wire-hanger fame) also does decent job mild long-suffering
a little bit weird , this movie . who would have thought that joan crawford play the normal sister while bette davis plays psycho ? anyway scene where tells they rats in cellar and then she serves her dinner...i'll let you figure out rest
one of the most well acted movies to ever be produced . joan crawford is fantastic in her role as persecuted wheel chair ridden sister victor buono magnificent his piano playing lover but best roles all screen hostiry portrayed by bette davis psychopathic fiend who slowly going insane and returning childhood you won't turn it off once on definitely see this chiller classic
eerie , suspensful and slightly twisted . i love it !
it was a very tricky movie . the end made hard to know who did what hell keyser soze ?
extremely well written and acted ; very suspenseful . a great classic film
this is an remarkable film in every way...it max ophul's summit of his american career . it also one the most tragic romatic films ever with superb performances by joan fontaine and louis jourdan everyone connected deserves highest praise
quite simply the most beautiful movie ever ! acting by two stars is first class , sets and photography are spellbinding story while tragic nonetheless one of best romantic stories .
what seems to be a rather simple film turns out very complex with nuances one does not catch on the initial viewing . scholars have studied and written about this directed by max ophuls agree it is probably best woman's picture ever come of hollywood , though most people think an european than american joan fontaine gives stunning performance as lisa louis jourdan equally fine stefan amazon.coms essential films
the two stars in this classic story of unrequited love are terrific...never were they better than film . joan fontaine is hopelessly woman with louis jourdan , a true cad and ladies' man has its intensely romantic moments but end result one great sacrifice tragedy max ophuls direction excellent
kevin spacey's best movie . he gives a better performance than in seven
no matter who they get to play dracula,bela lugosi owns the franchise.and he knows it .
lugosi will forever be dracula in millions of people's minds , and this is an excellent film . honestly though i prefer the gary oldman-wynona ryder version early 90's over one
bela lugosi s performance in this film will always , my mind represent the consummate rendition of dracula . he wasn t good looking by any stretch imagination but emanated old world sophistication and a kind reptilian combination repulsion/compulsion those hypnotic eyes ! i once heard that couldn speak english at time was cast memorized recited his lines phonetically may or not be true did easily correctly give you sense someone attempting to fit into culture which felt very foreign removed others vampire genre have certainly been interesting remains for me classic version timeless horror story
this film captures most of the strengths and weaknesses that remarkable man . scott won a well deserved oscar , broke new ground in biographies
love this movie!! ! while it definitely takes a serious slant on history , is fun to watch .
great story . it kept you wondering who keyser soze was , and when he would show up acting by everyone especially kevin spacey
an academy award deserver . george c scott was great he shows patton's true profile
'patton' is one of the great movies all-time , and most parodied solely for flag speech sequence at beginning . but in essence casting acting are both superb storyline fantastic as well george c scott great-but-controversial general s patton karl malden omar bradley ego conscience movie respectively finally with visuals it isn't too hard to see why this on afi's 100 greatest ever deserves be
very well done , an accurate portrayal of the life george patton .
i was stunned to see this movie not listed in the classics section when first started using rateitall . no list of is complete without including marvelous film george c scott gives a virtuoso performance his skill and depth role equalled by very few history cannot say enough about how great acting from top bottom believe one greatest films ever made ! alone should garner it 4 every rater action , drama humor sadness.. had all opening sequence with him standing front red white blue glorious final scenes masterpiece filmmaking scotts portrayal patton certainly studied many schools arts only for but its they just don't make movies like often modern times even rarer equal quality
classic , definitely the best non-musical ever made . while all five stars do a splendid job deborah kerr really takes cake despite karen's problems you feel for her and brings an elegance to role that would otherwise have been lost wonderful movie cast
although it now appears slightly dated , from here to eternity broke new ground with its critical evocation of military life and then daring romantic sequences (although the famous beach love scene between lancaster kerr seems rather tame) . brilliant acting by all i actually find burt dominates whole cast his powerful presence - strong performance was rewarded a york film circle award an oscar nomination clift is excellent as well
james jones-who wrote the novel-couldn't have picked a better cast-at their best .
i now enjoy watching older films to experience a different way of life . refreshing this film is exceptional with wicked cast including the superb donna reed (criminally underrated actress and as charming sexy ever) an excellent montgomery clift very funny guy in sinatra when concentrates on trio it great example hollywood cinema at its most accomplished , unfortunately burt lancaster deborah kerr also star no offense adequate actor but he pulls off his lines overwhelming hamminess woodeness which doesn't help character dialogue so cheap dated does her best are terrible those not used from golden era may find unintentionally hilarious put bluntly fortunately their little affair take up majority (and that music annoying) here eternity same scale or spectacle cr@p pearl harbour affleck et al lacking action explosions exquisite making you really do feel for characters (lancaster included) see forgotten gem get ready one 50s just reeds monty clifts spectacular performances
the critics didn't like this flick , but i enjoy gregory peck clumping around in manichean quest of good vs evil melville story hunt for great white whale . john huston directed and ray bradbury worked on screenplay
i grew up watching moby dick . isuppose it is my favorite movie
i am so happy to see this film listed ! has be one of my favorite comedies all time . gable and colbert are absolutely hilarious in tenderhearted story a couple meeting by "chance" on bus , whom soon go through measure comedic circumstances ultimately ending wonderful high note having been most familiar with gables later films its delight have recently able his earlier thoroughly enjoy pairing crawford both had natural zest for comedy movie him make wonderfully witty delightful pair if your the mood great laugh take chance best ever grace silvers screen
what the hell is this movie doing way down here?!! ! gable and colbert are seemlessly brilliant . has a great body was so revered at time that when he took off his shirt revealing wore no undershirt , sales of undershirts plummetted faster than stock market crash fast-paced witty dialogue grownup sophisticated acting study in can be acheived all stars aligned just right won eight academy awards 1934 still every bit classic
excellent , funny film where the snappy witty dialogue still hold up today . clark gable and claudette colbert are terrific together
one of my favorite movies ever . gable and colbert are funny the situations they get in hilarious compared to later screwball's , like his girl friday this is a classic
what an awesome screwball comedy . i watched this film for the first time in class last semester school movie gave me revelation that not all old , black and white films are worthless witty dialogue which is fired off like rapid gun fire incredibly acted !
if you know anything about movies than this is a cherished item . excellent action , dialogue and the perfect amount of twists turns just go out buy movie for god's sake
i loved this movie , not only was it filled with the comic greatness that screenplay provided but well acted and indeed deserved oscar .
this film is hilarious . the dialoge wonderfully snapy , and it delivered perfectly by clark gable claudette colbert in spite of some sketchy editing happened one night funniest--and best--movies ever made
claudette colbert . this movie , the pace of humor way they fell in love- hotel i love and can watch it over again
one of my very favorite movies all time !
there's a whole , lot going on in this movie - nine lives for all her different ways of life masks comedy tragedy pathos...i like the undercurrent seaminess peppard's gigolo and it's never actually stated but hepburn appears to be something call girl . i how she's loveable cold at same time capote really captured flighty women tick so cute you forgive nuttiness ending with cat rain is tearjerker fell love film
this is my favorite spacey film in that it really keeps you guessing until the end of movie . way story unfolds very unique and character development excellent
audrey was awesome in this . one of my favorites
i am a huge audrey fan .
a wonderful movie . stars today just don't have the glamour that audrey conveyed wild , wacky and touching definitely to see when you're feeling blue or want escape from world of back simpler era
at the moment hepburn raises her mask she is angry , sad ellated confused surprised and refined all once . it most beautiful thing ever caught on film i'll hum moon river to myself night now
i adore this movie . audrey *is* holly golightly it is hard to believe that truman capote actually wanted marilyn monroe for the part ! some criticize because of how different was from novel , but personally thought better call me sappy love happy ending there are so many things about moon river hilarious party scene cat  audrey's dresses yet strong ending. could go on and
i loved this movie sooooo much . it is one of my favorite movies and friends are obsessed with
m-o-o-o-o-n r-i-i-v-v-e-r-r-r , wider than a mi-i-i-le i'm cross-ing you in sty-y-y-yle some d-a-a-a-y.....haven't crossed it yet but still on my way.....oh audrey hepburn is the personification of what real woman looks like just someone else mentioned . we'll miss her an exceedingly good time !
good movie ! plot , characters story . great twists surprise ending(loved it) i didn't think was going to like this it at someone's house so watched would watch again definitely
it's so great . i watch it all in my spare time
breakfast at tiffany's- a timeless classic , the goddess audrey her finest .
george peppand and audrey hepburn star in this movie . is one of america's best romances tortured lovers , private tradegies a happy ending it beautiful
allo cat , you poor no-named slob.. .
i love the way she looks in this movie . only wish that had an interesting life like hers
tough to choose . contains the greatest silliloque every written kubrick's finest film
one of them most underrated movies . audrey hepburn's best
very gripping movie , but was so depressing . i still watch it something draws you into
a streetcar named desire is terrific movie . the acting phenomenal across board , but marlon brando and vivien leigh steal show with twisted dark plot keeps you on edge of your seat from start to finish it's about woman mysterious past who goes stay her sister brother-in-law in french quarter new orleans at first stands out as strange one then begin glimpse underbellies other characters pretty creepy see how unfolds if haven't seen this i recommend renting it or catching when tv
obviously , i have an affinity for this movie . think it is the greatest depiction in any medium of battle sexes left vs right brain art mediocrity illusion reality language culture addition there no better acting to be found other film williams understood society than he himself
stella....stella... . i read the play before saw movie and usually movies disappoint after you or book but 'streetcar named desire' is an exception marlon brando absolutely perfect in this acting was unbelieveable really liked story even though b w (black white) it keeps your attention whole way through definitely a time piece see south (new orleans) back 60's great
i love the movie and book so naturally i'm biased but really think it's an awesome watch .
most graham greene materials brought to the screen are good and this is no exception . one caveat try get a british print rather than american cuts some scenes that important anton karas' zither score unusual but really adds film once you used it scene at top of ferris wheel marvelous reminds me devil tempting christ probably stretch for people wound many religious themes into his novels , however interplay light shadows makes avoid colorized version
an excellent , dark and intriguing film with a bravura performance by welles as harry lime . brilliant cinematography
far superior than most movies ahead of it .
it will make you want to learn play the zither . see and understand cannot go wrong with this classic !
excellent film noir , one of the best ever made . great script and terrific performances by joseph cotten vali trevor howard especially orson welles cinematography gives right mood no way could this movie have been years later in color zither music is unique unfortgettable but fitting
absolutely a masterpiece from frame one . the closing scene is timeless
first-rate story and great characters ; eminently quotable dialogue a good , twisty plot gorgeous dark location shooting some of which is the essence noir catchy zither score .
i can't say how enjoyable this movie was . orson welles appearance from the shadows is truly genius use of lighting in b w film best have ever seen
great story . unexpected ending the best twist in any movie i've ever seen !
cornelius ryan's book on film does a good job about d day . i always enjoyed watching to see which of the many stars would appear next just everbody who was anybody in at time this flick
one of the greatest wwii movies all time .
a nasty movie , and i mean that in good way . very well written filmed acted particularly the supporting cast cleans up real-life bonnie clyde who were really small-time slack-jawed killers barely out of their teens with no more brains than rabid raccoon but that's minor criticism an otherwise excellent
directed by arthur penn , bonnie and clyde (1967) was considered a new wave film at the time of its release is landmark due to use sympathetic anti-heroes . for uninitiated movie revolves around adventures dysfunctional couple barrow (warren beatty) parker (faye dunaway) as they go on crime spree supporting cast impressive including michael j pollard gene hackman denver pyle portrayed modern day robin hoods appealed late 1960's counter-culture notwithstanding criticism from conservative mainstream press critics still studied in schools long-term social influence camera angles instance closing shot point view bullet-ridden vehicle bottom line that remains relevant today has aged well even classic
wonderful use of montage at the end . director did a great job making you side with these bad guys , little controversial for violence but i didn't think it was that compared today's in movies
great movie . still modern seems to encapsulate the appeal of love on run with wrong people , and creating your own community like a robin hood again sex (or lack it) plays an important though subtle part in this 60s flick you find yourself rooting for them but not totally which is brilliant manipulation actors
excellent . bonnie and clyde is a movie set in the depression era where two main characters , barrow (warren beatty) parker (faye dunaway) rob banks amdist dreariness despair of 1930s wanting to escape her job as waitress cafe teams up with together they become crime duo along way adds gas bar attendant clyde's brother buck his wife blanche their team not really intending harm or kill anyone spree takes violent turn when wanted for murdering bank clerk botched robbery are then only robbers on run but murderers well there's lots shooting i found conlusion be jolting unexpected truly classic it gives viewers some insight into desperation experienced by those who lived throughout great what people were willing do
the greatest trick devil ever pulled was convincing world he didn't exist  . kevin spacey is great
i always knew this was one of the greats but didn't see it until later in life . what surprised me that so funny and witty a cheeky kind way forget called there is name for overwrought style acting they used back then movie seemed to break rule bit wonder if considered controversial or groundbreaking it's time
released in 1941 , john huston made his directorial debut with the maltese falcon . film essentially set benchmark for noir and is still studied schools uninitiated mysterious femme fatale brigid o'shaughnessy (mary astor) shows up at spade however a saint compared to clients others whom he must deal bottom line that see those interested best of cinema during golden age hollywood
a truly great masterpiece . cast , crackerjack script sharp witty and edgy dialogue it is bogart's second best performance after rick blaine amazing debut of sydney greenstreet who isn't 2nd to bogart in he's equal him at times maybe even better brilliant film noir classic
one of bogart's finest performances , in a superb cast with great script . portrayal spade is precise humourous and violent
john huston truly was great . this is his first film , and it one of the all-time classic masterpieces screen humphrey bogart in role that made him a star (yes there once time where he wasn't most famous face ever on movie screen) cast supporting characters scratch an unforgettable weasly sleazy criminal (peter lorre) talkative fat man (sydney greenstreet) rodent-like henchman (elisha cook jr.) mysterious woman (mary astor) who turns out to be more dangerous than she actually must-see for all fans straddles divide between cultural moment 
kevin spacey really got noticed in this movie as well made it popular . the whole comes together amazingly unpredictable ending way was told kept you completely immersed time
classic movie with humphrey bogart . the suspense , plot make this an old black and white film i love it keeps you guessing when thought main character was doomed he found a way to prevail
this movie is a great example of classical , mystery full intrigue and last second guessing . classic must
i don't find the movie "dated" in least . isn't topic classic movies ?
edward g robinson was still a gangster in this film but great religious one to watch , especially the parting of sea....... .
the first half was hard to follow , but when it got rolling an incredible movie with startling special effects...especially considering how long ago made . i've never seen a single that did justice bible story except for this one
thank goodness abc continues to show this great biblical film every easter . always entertaining watch
demille's last film and he pulled out all the stops . moses turned his back on a privileged life to lead people of egypt it has an exceptional cast parting red sea rivals any modern special effects especially loved charlton heston anne baxter oh , you stubborn splendid adorable fool !
a classic epic hollywood production of story essential to understanding western civilization .
director cecil b . demille's best film , about moses from the old testament a gigantic production packed with enormous crowd scenes lavish spectacles and widescreen special effects orchestrated dazzling brilliance second greatest historical religious movie ever made first is ben hur
while the political correct talking heads of today love to sarcastically call charlton heston 'moses national rifle association' , he nontheless is an imposing figure excellent choice as moses and cecil b.demille told story leading jews out israel well in this production...a good family film for any occasion. .
a brilliant film , one of welles very best .
that guy from free-thinking should be not-thinking . usual suspects is a great movie with an incredible ending
hilarious , zany and fun screwball comedy . cary grant katherine hepburn are perfect especially hits a homerun proved that she could do excellent supporting cast with may robson charles walter catlett
i've only seen a few katharine hepburn films and this by far is my favorite ! she so much fun moves quickly from scene to it never gets dull . cary grant also great his forte was totally the screwball comedy
by far , this is one of the best screwball comedies ever made . grant and hepburn are priceless snappy dialoge wonderful fabulous film
by means of this movie , i managed to convince my 16-year-old sister and a half dozen her friends that black-and-white movies can be good (they even rented it again themselves when wasn't there) !
this film couldn't be made today . the talent isn't there among hollywood elite and no one would consider it an interesting enough story great example of 'old hollywood' movie
i was entirely exhausted after the dining room scene . it never fails to amaze me everytime see great movie !
superb . the dining room scene alone is worth price of admission
patty duke and anne bancroft gave incredible performances as they portrayed helen keller's life story .
bogart is at his best as a good guy (frederick b . dobbs) who comes down with deadly case of gold fever in the classic morality tale walter huston and tim holt also give fine performances iconic scenes ("stinking badges" "walter dance") pepper this greed futility little bobby blake makes an appearence mexican boy that sells bogie winning lottery serves financial grubsteak needed to get expedition off running from film have been hilariously parodied ensuing years following it's release including great bugs bunny take-off bart , millhouse martin prince playing principals (bart had bogie's role)in simpson's episode where boys pool their funds buy rare comic book
this is a john huston tale of gold and the greed betrayal that it brings out in people . bogart plays his usual role but works here remember , badges ? we don't need no steenking ! where phrase originated
anotherr great from the silver screen.. . they just don't make em like this anymore!! !
i'm stunned that this movie isn't more appreciated here . a big fan of bogart , but walter hustons performance sticks with me most it definitely makes my all time top ten
everybody remembers the famous line badges ? we don't need no stinking  . lesson , of course is that greed never good and will wind up causing you to lose everything that's exactly what happens not a completely satisfying ending but i guess it had be way get point across
this is my favorite movie of all time.how didn't sweep the oscars beyond me.bogart,walter huston , father director and grandfather anjelica tim holt star.two disillusioned drifters decide to enlist aide a grizzled prospector search for gold in sierra madres mexico.walter has forboding speech concerning evil that can do.the men start out on long arduous trek into mountains . well until starts piling up.this shows changes person undergoes life.the scene where each man repeatedly goes night make sure their stash still safe sets tone rest movie.they survive banditos,indians others looking take piece action.but they themselves ?
bogey made a fan out of me with this one . all-male cast - shows bogey's degradation from tramp to greedy , evil not that great transformation which is why his subtle acting so stunning you hate him but in wierd way root for superb by

towers over other bogie vehicles such as casablanca  , maltese falcon and high sierra .
will you stake a fellow american to meal ?
the treasure of sierra madre is one greatest westerns ever made . it has an intriguing plot , lots adventure well drawn characters and not too many cheap stereotypes that bring down old contains classic line badges ? we don't need no stinking !
an absolutely timeless classic . the battle scenes are immense in their scope and impact winner of best picture 1930 , this movie like machine gun whose inventer mistakenly thought his invention would mark end to kind senseless carnage did nothing sway powers that be from continuing give future inspiration for moviemakers business war is only good when shells bullets spent young men die great military industrial complex thrives by supplying still more dispensable soldiers into mix film was made with idea it shown leaders all nations hoping they see futility combat shame them bringing evil think it's working yet ?
not only is this the best war movie ever made , it could be . story survives today just as dod when was first never mind that charecters are german (the enemy) moving nonetheless speaks to and about germans but any soldeir in conflict time tale timeless really puts horrors of proper prespective very well acted lew ayers does an excellent job i can highly recomend for everyone
even in an age of spectacular realism and special effects , this remains my favorite movie . it captures the hopelessness men who discover that war has made their existence trivial last shred humanity is comradery as they face together prospect death every minute day along trenches
a true classic....the best anti-war movie ever made . it holds up well with realistic scenes of trench warfare and first rate story line
so much better than that cinematic tripe from baz luhrman.. .
julie andrews should have got it , she can sing !
i am not someone who is overly fond of musicals but this one great !
a great movie . audrey hepburn was good as eliza doolittle flower girl who meets henry higgins prefessor of language boasts he could even teach to act and speak proper ends up staying with while teaches her be lady.rex harrison is also the arrogant by end has grown care for lots songs just charming story that came from book pygmalion scene at horse race especially cute
i must've seen this movie over 100 tiumes . it was my favorite as a child , and remains to day audrey is amazing in who would've thought that someone classy flawless would make such great eliza doolittle ? much love julie andrews think perfect for the screen version of classic
indy rules
intriguing , especially when i think about the similarities and differences between marine boot camp canadian military went through . scenes were best part of movie but seeing microcosm that unit moving hue city in what was one marines defining moments made (please forgive cliche) history come alive
audrey hepburn is incredible in this movie . excellent songs , costumes and acting make a real classic
audrey hepburn is my idol . this a 6 star movie everything about it fabulous rex harrison was made for the part , as i'm upset that didn't win an oscar i don't think julie andrews good best !
my fair lady- audrey again at her finest . she was the cutest in this film
audrey hepburn , what else do i have to say ? great music . my fair lady addresses an important topic- social classes the costumes were beautiful
my favorite is fair lady b/c audrey hepburn really made the movie great . she a actress and classy woman
my fair lady is definitely one of the classics .
a love so exemplary it should imitate life
best christmas movie and natalie wood is awesome !
the cutest christmas movie ever !
natalie wood is adorable in this movie , but she's more than just the cute little kid she can really act too !
a lovely heart-warming story .
love this movie . i agree with zarbon , black/white version is better than color a great classic
a classic that will never die . the black and white version is much better than newer great movie for every christmas !
r . lee makes this a 5
one of my all time favorite movies . i know that day i'll be watching it and steve mcqueen will make over damn fence
under-estimated by critics at the time of its release , great escape has proven over years to be a true classic entertaining newer generations as well old . it's simply adventure with landmark roles for most stars although steve mcqueen his legendary bravura and motorcyle adventures who raised attention my personal favourite is james garner under-stated tongue-in-cheek performance scrounger gathers all essential materials builds an unlikely friendship very english room mate donald pleasance (tea without milk so uncivilized) however rest cast are perfect in their
after watching this empowering film you will probably catch yourself whistling to elmer bernstein's theme the movie .
one of the best , most entertaining and underrated films ever !
instantly my favourite film,aged 12,and still a supremely entertaining world war 2 adventure;superlative cast and array of characters,spectacular scenery,tantalising suspense,memorable music,thrilling action..the stuff legend.perfect for carefree wallow- put simply,great escapism !
one of the best war genre movies all time . it has big name stars like steve mcqueen , charles bronson james coburn garner and many more also great action dialogue suspense it;s over 2 hours long but never boring you get caught up in characters there personal lives as well general plot definitely a must see for whole family
the best film of sixties , and maybe all time .
what a film , they simply do not make films like this anymore . we need is more with all star casts one i know that you are going to say about sneakers which did have lot of stars in it but when watch once and see how many sticks your mind ! anyway everybody on screen or was go for hollywood
this is the movie to watch.r lee best drill instructer ever ! hoo ah
one of my personal favorites . steve mcqueen is a god! ! the acting great , story and music great.everything fantastic it's filled with action has cool motorcycle chase scene what else do you need ?
as a young person conditioned by today's flashy eye-candy movie-making , i really have to up my patience in order appreciate most of the classics . even when do that lot them still strike me having little too much hype built around but this movie truly impressed besides fact it managed keep attention wasn't feel-good or ambiguous nor was presented matter-of-factly also showed scale nazi brutality without gore
a finely crafted , carefully scripted and well acted movie . it has aged surprisingly although probably doesn't have much appeal for the gunfire car-chase crowd
wonderful , movie . it tells the story of 3 war vets who meet by chance on their return home they all live in same city and you get to see how lives continue heartaches have overcome this is a everyone should at least once surely shows that man has been things will never be again for him
this movie is a touching exploration of the human spirit and it easy to see why won as many awards did . story deals with three men's problems readjusting life after world war ii one most poignant characters homer , who lost both his arms during watching him struggle adjust new truly heartbreaking other subtly point out evils they wasted best years their lives fighting missed on important thing in time families i can t say enough about how wonderful ; you need for yourself !
if you're human , this movie will move your heart and make you think . the combination of excellent acting a realistic script lead to consider what happens those who personally pay price freeedom
a fantastic movie about wwii veterans returning to their everday lives after the war . this maybe most intelligent stress of returing home it deals with everything from physical impairment changed emotional relationships due time and distance
this is a truly beautiful , touching movie dealing with the problems readjustments and every day experiences encountered by veterans returning home from wwii . it timeless universal tale about everyone who has ever left had to deal something devastating in their lives attempts reconcile inevitable changes within themselves what they once taken for granted as norm if you can't relate personally know someone can great cast writing acting wonderful sentiment
great movie ! the cinematography , direction script and soundtrack really propelled this . very true to cynicism in dating scene difficulty for young men relate world (parents women) cool metaphors (christ church fishbowl him scuba gear ms robinson hallway after he spills beans - all symbols of alienation) hip style film is superb copied by movies like ferris bueller dark chic urbane funny witty i that leave you wondering they symbolize where women are headed future what ultimately will mean each other also how we never know what's his head he's more a symbol than character haunting image
an all-time classic . i saw it for the first time today and was completely dazzled , all way from chilling start to slick dynamic (and even more chilling) end if you want a romantic flick that doesn't pile on sentimentality then this is place heading one very big puzzlement arose while watching powerful enthralling film in which young man finds himself falling love with daughter of woman whom he having affair just why so many people always refer as comedy thought lot serious haunting than funny obscure angles sequences were shot well done added general unease hoffman successfully able transfer viewers via his character's own fear insecurity ending amazing - real andrenalin inducer rounded off perfect brought poignent but at same uplifting close heck worth brilliant sound track alone only have hear 'the silence' makes my heart skip beat
began a new era of hollywood movies . i love simon and garfunkle's tune , the performances overall feel movie true classic it's in my top 20 not only that hilarious !
although never as good or funny the critics make out  , this sees a young dustin hoffman provide an intelligent performance . wonderful soundtrack some laughs and incredible symbolism
great movie with chemistry , character study awesome cinematography and the deliciously evil martyr mrs . robinson played meticulously by talented anne bancroft
a low starter , but an excellent finish . one of my favorites with fantastic hoffman and beautiful ross btw the soundtrack d especially scarborough fare is best there next to good bad ugly
great movie . seen it many times
the graduate is a 1967 classic comedy-drama that you have to see belive . film about young man who gets seduced by his girlfriend's mother , mrs robinson as goes along their relationship quite strange and small he still dates her daughter
the graduate is a great movie because it timeless . says so much about human nature but remains simple also manages to be very funny generally draws reaction from audience
this movie has it all . a girl chases boy likes another runs away and the music is tight simon garfunkel ending good but real feel
one of the best movies ever made . and it hasn't lost much with age (much like anne bancroft as mrs robinson) if anything , story alienation in modern society is more relevant now than was back then my favorite scene when dustin hoffman katherine ross are connecting for first time - they close top convertable that shuts us viewers out their conversation so we only hear random noises around them talk car
brando should have stayed at this weight . his i coulda had class , been a contenda.. talk kayoes olivier's hamlet
arguably the best acting performance in history of american cinema marlon brando plays terry malloy with such vigor it's impossible to stop watching . his intensity is equalled only by delicacy , particulary classic scene brother charlie this film about guilt and redemption up there greatest films all time
not one of my all-time favorites , it is an acting powerhouse . you do feel for brando with the whole i coulda been a contendah angst another movie like high noon where loner tries to fix broken community first time watch will be hard turn off
this movie was amzing . that pretty much covers it
best movie ever...sgt . hartman is my hero , mother the hottest guy and this has so many great quotable lines
bad ass ! this movie has it all : music , acting a plot unlike most movies today . my 5th favorite of time
this is the best movie i have ever seen . film was perfect am schocked that isnt ranked at least 10 had a fantastic ending and end can't think of one reason why someone would not like
good music , great photography marlon brando and karl malden at their best,talking about traitors a subject very fragil but for man like kazan that lived persecutions,the best film of elia
broderick crawford's tour de force as an idealistic politician gone corrupt , ruthless and power-mad . based on the life of huey long one-time governor senator unofficial military dictator louisiana crawford deserved his oscar notable supporting performance by mercedes mccambridge campaign aide/jilted lover
a very entertaining movie . has few bumps but is still fine effort it tells an interesting story and doesn't have that typical good guy wins ending
great movie to be in the same league as 'ben hur'........ .
spartacus was a real roman hero , and i think that the depiction of him is true to legends are written in history . some things movie false but for most part goes along with quite well
i have met r . lee ermy and he made that freaking movie outstanding ! now get off my obstacle
great , wonderful fabulous movie . it's hard to believe that this was hepburn's first professional role ever but it she won an oscar for best actress and certainly deserved greggory peck in his of the unsympathetic than love reporter ending had be as much we would handsome lovely hepburn together alas they cannot is a princess he lowly just never work very gratifying see anne stand up herself little after her excursion bottom line : classic with two terrific actors
roman holiday is my favorite audrey hepburn film , although her best performance was in breakfast at tiffany's .
audrey hepburn is one of the best actresses ever and this , her first movie certainly doesn't disprove that . she electrifying with gregory peck scenes them are charming funny ending perfect none other would have done as good
this is my favorite audrey hepburn movie ! i love it so much .
my all-time favourite . i've seen it many times and still makes me laugh cry
mmm-mmm good . that is what audrey hepburn in this film she at her finest mix of comedy and drama which co-stars the equally as talented gregory peck story never drags 2 stars ignite enough fire to light up new york city for days definitely see classic
this may be my favorite movie of all time . it's a charming tale an unhappy princess(audrey hepburn , in her first role ever.) who escapes out into beautiful italy traversing about rome she meets up with (and so handsome) reporter played perfectly by gregory peck (who along burt lancaster one the most handsome actors ever) their spent together they begin to fall love amongst has battle his guilt over taking pictures princess doesn't reveal herself him..but he finds and plans write article escape.) growing feelings for goes back position eventually but that ruin romance film..it just adds bittersweet element scenes audrey seeing sights are enchanting not mention hilarious amusing emotional is defiently worth watching
what is your major malfunction ? this movie kicked ass and took names like nobody's business .
roman holiday is a harmless classic on the verge of being classified comedy . it story princess who , unhappy with her present life decides to try out rest world an excellent entertainer !
one of my favorite movies because it's set in bella otalia . also , the two main characters being hepburn and peck perfectly fit stereotype americans europe fifties movie shows several famous roman buildings monuments gives a little insight into life after war
still the king of kongs and about fifty bazillion times better than one that is currently playing at a theater near you . jackson's film certainly lot piece crap came out in late seventies but transparent computerized special effects hundred extra minutes story add nothing to this one-of-a-kind spectacular don't let acting performances or thirties style dialogue sway your opinion , (they actually greatly allure original) featuring stop-action footage are vastly superior souless art we now machines create for us oh yeah faye wray looked ten chick new flick
classic movie and scary when i was young , well made for the era..... .
baby , you'll have the tallest darkest leading man in hollywood ! -- meriam c . cooper to fay wray....the new peter jackson remake will no doubt be expensive and impressive spectacular all that stuff-- but it won't half as good or scary some films-- like kong casablanca-- simply should not remade since there is a kind of perfection about originals
released in 1933 , the original king kong is an epic and magical examination of unknown mysteries nature what happens when these forces are unleashed our closed manmade environment . for those living under a rock somewhere story involves director carl denham (robert armstrong) looking to shoot picture on skull island with his handpicked heroine ann darrow (fay wray) along muscle jack driscoll (bruce cabot) after production crew land natives capture as offering giant ape instead devouring her takes lair ; however rescue fighting dinosaurs other hazards they also decides scrap favor showing freak show new york city course escapes find until things decided top empire state building though this film was directed by merian c cooper ernest b schoedsack movie so effective due truly artistic work animator willis h o'brien stop-motion effects that remain even today bottom line one films part common american experience (and beyond) evidenced how often scenes have been alluded media (eg cars' video you might think)
technically advanced film for its time . willis o'brien really conveyed a personality on the big ape , much better job than bogus sterile special effects of these days perverse love story tale sexual frustration metaphor black experience in america course it's dated and creaky but also 70 years old one typically idiotic posters slighted this because white well color processes hadn't been developed features 1933 b/w does have visual vocabulary an aesthetic own that doesn't necessarily make it inferior to shows you how lacking imagination most people are spoiled rotten by gimmicks novelty
king kong is the film from which action/adventure epic was born . it's dazzling special effects , (for there time although they do hold up quite well today) to ambitious-ness of story (and is) entertainment at its best particularly in a when world dire need it definately one my all-time favorites !
when i was an (immature!) teenager the three things which particularly attracted me to this film were  : 1) how gorgeous fay wray looked in palm of ape ! 2) hilarious huge close-up king kong's face and 3) a morbid fascination with fate unfortunate villagers kong broke into their settlement . benefit few more years experience find my feelings have remained - er exactly same hugely enjoyable strangely moving
excellent adventure story ! this is the film that started it all for giant monster movies . very few of it's predecessors have surpassed (godzilla , in original form probably only movie) o'brien cooper were masterminds
the first mith coming directly from films without a literature origin and in its version it was most human carachter an animation protagonist .
this john ford movie should be much further up the list ! wayne is a misfit and loner on quest to rescue his neice who was stolen by indians . why does wayne's character really want find her ? duke more of an anti-hero than hero here last scene terrific--wind it back watch again
john wayne at his best!one of , if not the best western all time .
best western of all-time , and john wayne's peformance in any movie he starred . a totally different role for the duke this one was dark prejudicial character played so well no dull moments film stirring emotional entertaining from beginning to end
my favorite john wayne movie . one of the best westerns ever made ! anyone who wants to see a great performance by , should this
this is one of the most important films ever made . it showed versatility steven spielberg and his miraculous ability to make movies for masses that not only please visually , but also intellectually harrison ford give performance career in exciting fast paced thoughtful action film
a film of enormous scope , breath-taking beauty and thought-provoking drama the searchers is movie for many people . its influence seen all over films such great directors as spielberg lucas scorsese coppola john ford made but one which he will be remembered
atmospheric..elegiac..haunting..poetic..stunningly photographed..majestic scenery ; comfortably the greatest western.a personal favourite of martin scorsese,among many others,it's a wayne film which should be enjoyed by non-fans.here his persona is more complex and ambiguous than usual.the ending,when he's framed in doorway,torn between wilderness civilisation (a theme director john ford)is justly famous.it also superbly balances opening.the moment when he picks up frightened nathalie wood (after years searching)- let's go home,debbie - always has me gulping .
great westen story ! not the best western i've ever seen , but very high up there . john ford is a genius he certainly has feel for landscape in his pictures and it shows searchers those who think wayne bad actor i urge you to see him this film potrayal of ethan edwards one performances cinema history only thing don't understand how at first debbie reluctant go with them when other guy (i forget name) sneaks into camp tells her he's gonna take away she's more than happy last minute slip-up which kind hurts dramatic impact climax that pretty solid
could be the best of traditional westerns . wayne was in one his , perhaps only outdone by work fort apache  as with all its era it is not politically correct treatment indians however does convey a sense harshness for involved confrontation between settler and indian south-west good flick
i can't belive that nobody gave this 5 stars movie is awesome! ! lon chaney a great performance it was one of the best performances ever given! love and i've watched several times , never gets old it's so fun to watch as phantom like setting paris opera beautiful flim deserves greatest actors lived
this silent classic,rated among the all-time top 10 by village voice ,spanish and french critics , was inexcusably omitted from a.f.i's 100.by turns lyrical,dramatic,exuberant,romantic enchanting,its gloriously photographed tale,of a man in germanic-style tempted against his kind wife glamorous vamp city,mixes director's european artistic sensibility with american narrative flair- for 90 minutes of cinephile heaven .
great movie i loved it
movies usually blow it when dealing with issues of racism...films often make the common mistake (like we all do) simply painting one character as 'good' and other 'evil' . i believe this film is greatest exploration racism i've ever seen in a movie nobody's or 'evil'- characters are developed performances spectacular rod stieger small-town sheriff unforgetable sidney poitier philadelphia cop no less fascinating watch these two stubborn learn just enough about each to mutual respect powerful example great filmmaking
the sleekiest of film noirs and deliciously twisted all way to end , an excellent mystery . gene tierney (laura) is beautiful
it's the only movie which justifies love affairs of a man .
here we have david lean again . this movie goes on too long but it has everything you need--romance , heartbreak nobility betrayal action etc pasternak's work is well done i didn't like omar sharif in the title role 1960's he grown me over decades and am satisfied his as doc characters are english however so what guess
another great epic , well for me anyway!....fantastic soundtrack... .
i was not hoping to even see doctor zhivago  . thought it some dark , dismal film but surprised at how quickly got into the movie it's such a wonderful story watched in two viewings so didn't come across as being long and tiresome for me of (omar sharif) who falls love during russian revolution truly captivating alec guinness also makes good appearance terrific
this is the second greatest film of all time after lawrence arabia both directed by david lean , best director ever . a tragic love story on an epic scale set against background russian revolution whole cast gave great performances julie christie (lara) remarkably beautiful movie atmospheric and visually stunning like leans films you really feel it was filmed in russia even though mostly finland spain not canada cinematography score doctor zhivago should have won picture award instead they to sound music very good big mistake academy awards i think only reason because fox studios nearly bankrupt so them undeserving boost 10 times better
a supremely tragic love story . one of the greatest all time wonderful score surreal winter scenes classic movies get their distinction by fact that casting is so superb it with dr zhivago  , an epic tale hate betrayal et al during russian revolution julie christie absolutely lights up screen and rod stieger omar shariff geraldine chaplin turn in admirable performances have seen this about dozen times
one of the greatest movies ever made -- and my favorite all times ! an historical epic with grand , sweeping views scenery humanity a tragic love story to capture heart . musical score is terrific cinema at its absolute best
this movie really should have one best picture over sound of music . wonderful story and so beautifully filmed
the first time i saw this movie , laughed so hard that my ribs ached for three days . studio insisted on romantic subplot but you sort of need interludes to catch your breath in end boys' anarchy prevails stateroom scene must be funniest single history movies
there is a lot in this movie than you might think . after they failed at the box office w/ duck soup , marx bros revamped their plots and scripts put everything but kitchen sink into them apparently average depression-era americans couldn't handle social farces - only fizzy musical/romance/comedy/adventures night opera has all of that it also some great commentary case about plight immigrants may not notice when chico harpo are loading up with food playing music on ship it's very apparent particularly how stare breathless loads buffet table always gets me testament to genius musical wizardry fascinating esp harpo's harp really beautifully done just don't get talent like anymore finally groucho comic whole stateroom scene amazing if laugh again don;t know what comedy one my all-time films i honestly can't fathom people can be fans warner cartoons based ! bugs bunny
easily paul newman's best role and film!what we have hear is failure to communicate!one of the lines in movie history .
paul newman's finest , if this was one of his salad dressings it would be ranch ! worth watching @ 3 a.m . on a work day can't wait to see again..
this movie does not have a failure to communicate with the talented paul newman and george kennedy playing their roles perfection .
how can anyone ever want to eat a boiled egg after they see this film  ?
my all time favorite movie . did anyone notice plastic jesus playing during carrie fischer's seen in the latest kevin smith film one of greatest scripts ever written i guarantee you've heard someone quote failure to communicate line last week mellencamp quotes luke on track scarecrow guns n' roses uses a byte from it open civil war ronald reagen quoted state union address ethan hawk reality bites hey guys , how many times have you those sexy scenes gorgeous woman washing car seductively (liv tyler was recent one) ? got this thank for ! oh anything that sweet has just be named lucille things about is fact leaves viewer decide themselves exactly what details luke's life are parking meter tells everything need know him first shot also two speaches god filmed *****+
this is such a great movie . everytime i watch it am still amazed the acting fantastic and story classic , will never get boring to
excellent acting all around , especially from paul newman and george kennedy . never could figure out why that idiot luke kept coming back to the lockup though have seen it about 10 times
have seen this one several times . great cast
this was a great movie . paul newman wonderful
this is a great sci-fi flick . it carried an anti-nucleur message that was big in 1951 i worried as kid patricia neal would forget klaatu barata nikto !
the more time goes by , better this movie seems . although rooted in -- and inspired cold war mccarthyism robert wise's neat unpretentious tale is truly timeless fine performances michael rennie patricia neal sam jaffe-- plus gort one of great robots film history
great film ! no deep subtext , just a very well thought-out . one of the best in sci-fi and often copied
classic sf from director robert wise . released the same year as thing (just its re-make was in et) , this pretty much first movie to speculate that they might not be evil bems (bugeyedmonsters) after all has an advanced and mature message for cold war audiences but still relevant today one of robots klaatu barada nikto
you gottal rent this and watch joan crawford in truly kinky film . the joan--mercedes mccambridge brawl over man is a classic symbolism flick legion ! i hadn't seen since was kid then it started appearing on cable again couldn't remember where had heard line , never shake hands with left-handed draw there (sterling hayden)
as others have previously stated , this film's strength lies in its unique quirky outside-the box originality . there is simply no other western quite like it stretches the genre directions seldom ever ventures perhaps why film was/is such a hit france - even french website dedicated to amc channel also broadcasts johnny guitar about once or twice year and i highly recommend watching for peggy lee's haunting title soundtrack alone joan crawford portrays pre-feminist-femme-fatale who if necessary can trade verbal jabs bullets with any man woman crosses her certainly not your typical 1950's fare which one more reason check out
oh.. , come on people . i know i'm gonna misspell their names but this movie so out there weird messed up that it's goooood mercedes mccambrige verus joan crawford ward bond with his posse all dressed in black preacher coats sterling heydon as johnny guitar don't think he knew how to play one has little student carries around and the kid played by a guy brookyln accent did alot of actors westerns apparently old west was full them it take seriously is great
crazy , overheated and queer as heck .
i love this movie...it's like overhearing the conversation in ladies' room . great performances and just plain ol' fun
not bad for a movie they stole from the japanese . originally based on film called seven samuri , magnificent tells tail of hired guns who chase guys away mexican town better western would be hard to find inspiring music opening credits last bullet falss it's high adventure all way only one best westerns ever made movies unfortunatly some pretty dismal sequeals but original still stands as great i watch it nearly every time is shown tube which ain't often enough !
the last great action western hollywood would ever produce , with a star-studded roster caliber of which wouldn't be seen again until it's mad world . everyone can usually name five seven actors but draw blank at naming two (kinda like dwarves) : steve mcqueen (in his defining role) yul brynner charles bronson jim coburn bob vaughn brad dexter and horst bucholz they're all hired to "shoo some flies away from little village down south" lead horsefly being unctuously rat-like eli wallach shot in mexico sturges direction makes change samurai cowboy seamless natural when elmer's score chimes you feel swell adventure your collarbone barely thing wrong this classic (lingers on message or then snaps back job hand) skip afternoon broadcasts opt for dvd as letterbox is only way take everything grand end beloved era
a magnificent movie with cast .
the best musical score to date , and yet did not win academy award
this movie is one of my favorites . it has action and adventure a bit romance , but doesn't glamorize the life gunfighter which makes more honest than some very good
brilliant , underrated noir film by welles in which he gives one of the great screen performances as hank quinlan skilled but corrupt cop .
next to citizen kane this is orson welles other great film , but more fun watch . spectacular as the corrupt overweight cop charles heston not convincing a mexican narcotics agent its kind of funny see him look like one janet leigh really good his wife and makes her first encounter nervous motel manager(played brilliantly by dennis weaver) joseph cotten marlena dietrich make amusing cameos classic noir
kubrick almost never misses , and hit his target again in this one . it's about how human beings are transformed into killers some learn the lesson a little too well as we see at end of first half second shows results transformation fmj is rich powerful anti-war statement : it amuses me to no that right-wingers on here completely missed point
an amazing movie and far , ahead of its time . film noir but the storyline never slows for effect brilliantly put together would probably get more respect if not compared to welles's other classic citizen kane
how amazing was this movie ? to think - it got bad reviews when came out , as did psycho.. .
this movie has it all , charlton heston playing mexican orson welles bloated sweaty performance as hank quinlan and a gang forcing weed on poor janet leigh . also that really superb long shot in the beginning goes forever film is just plain entertaining
one of the most unique and entertaining films on 1950s . orson welles' unorthodox bizarre film noir deals with controversial subjects like narcotics corruption works despite charlton heston's terrible performance as mike vargas , mexican (!) agent who gets mixed up in an investigation into a terrorist bombing janet leigh plays susan his american wife is resting remote hotel until she terrorized by gang welles gives superb respected but corrupt texas cop hank quinlan screenplay based previously shelved which was pulp novel badge evil (1956) never read film's success lies mostly its editing stark lighting sweeping photography set u.s./mexican border town visual style that has rarely been seen since release 1958
tied along in a basic sextet of chaplin's best my top ten movies , with dog's life (1919) the kid ('21) city lights (31) modern times (36) and great dictator (40) . groundbreaking influential comedy that set high standards to equal or surpass
chaplin's best silent film . see the great dictator now ! comedy...ever
howark hawks directed . john wayne , dean martin ricky nelson angie dickinson walter brennan and others in a marvelous oater ! the know-it-all critics panned it at time now it's considered classic dino even croon couple of tunes
another fantastic film in john wayne's portfolio of magnificent films .
one of the top five westerns all-time . a very entertaining movie that did not rely on duke to carry it fantastic supporting cast was main reason why this is such great film in addition geat directing and writing
i have always enjoyed this movie . john wayne , dean martin and walter brennan are all really great in it
and don't forget walter brennan - his best movie! !
one of dean martin's best performances ever and john wayne wasn't bad either . this movie is a favorite at our house we range in age from 21 to 74 watch !
bruno antony is without a doubt alfred hitchock's best and most sinister villian . played brilliantly to perfection by robert walker who with the right amount of charm , sardonic humor evil story strangers on train one hitchcock's brilliant two men meet talk casually about swapping murders so they would not have motiv decides take it seriously hitchcock keeps suspense end it's must see for any fan
hey guys , comment on this movie ! it's great top 15 hitchcocks
i'll be damned if i ever figured out the plot , and don't think raymond chandler howard hawks did either . so what ? bogie bacall snappy patter classy dames everyone smoked since you were more likely to get plugged in back than live long enough cancer....those days ! remake 1978 with mitchum (who made a pretty good marlow) sarah miles just didn't work they inexplicably transferred it all england film noir doesn't make color
private detective philip marlowe is hired to investigate an extortion mystery affecting a wealthy elderly general and his two daughters.brilliant essential 40's film noir;an unmissable chance wallow in the bogie-bacall magic,the electric(raymond chandler william faulkner!)dialogue,fizzing sexual chemistry,labyrinthine plot,atmospheric photography marvellous howard hawks direction .
spectacular , marvolous perfect . pretty high praise for a movie but all these are totally deserving in one of the greatest if not classic mystery time humphrey bogart is superb his role as wise-cracking chick magnet philip marlowe and lauren bacall ( who never dissapointing only female alive can make smoking look good ) magnificent sexy deep voiced love interest it has comedy action taught suspense definitely must see any fans movies
being a fan of raymond chandler , it's natural to be little apprehensive watch one his mystery novels on the big screen . sleep does not disappoint ! it covers as much in novel that hays office would allow true style film noir chandler's philip marlowe was role bogart born play and heat between him bacall rises off waves dialogue is sharp has real 'rat-a-tat-tat' acting undramatic genuine could 1940's personally i prefer this maltese falcon  although maltese. perfect study 'film noir' premiere
this 1952 film was one of the first to seriously tackle such issues as alcoholism and codependency in a personal way , but never an overtly preachy or doctinaire manner . shirley booth won well-deserved oscar for her charming portrayal bittersweet classic burt landcaster gives credible noteworthy performance aging jaded battle-worn husband recommended
this movie is the ultimate buddy flick . infamous final stand noteworthy but i prefer emergent vulnerability of men as they start to share more themselves with each other and viewer it dawns on them that are in over their heads
my favorite western movie . has comedy , drama and history
humor,action,great story , great acting,beautiful cinematography,and handsome cast!what,s not to love about this movie ?
you will not laugh / cry learn by the numbers i teach
seldom has such a powerhouse of acting talent been assembled and what film ! this is sensitive emotive subject needs to be handled professionally with respect . stanley kramer skillfully draws first rate performances from his 'a' list cast he avoids sentimentality or traditional 'hollywoodisms' , creating an atmosphere so real that we feel are observers in genuine court room the graphic footage actually taken at liberation some camps only serves make more harrowing yet effective brilliant casting solid judge spencer tracy authoritive whilst having wrestle own personal feelings maxamillian schell as young attorney ambitious misguided loyalties montgomery clift tortured soul life uses deamons effect simpleton who subjected steriliztion stand-out however judy garland hausfrau falsely accused intimacey jew proves her short sequences she very much equal game legendary musical star for second time career was not awarded oscar which nominated one greatest oversights history academy acts peice miscasting my mind burt lancaster  always professional performance german does quite gel altogether though brave risky really pays off
an excellent film with some powerful , heart-wrenching performances . four nazi judges are on trial for using their court atrocities the question becomes should they be held accountable ? a superb cast which include spencer tracy maximmilian schell burt lancaster richard widmark montgomery clift judy garland and marlene dietrich is absolutely heartwrenching as victim of sterilization gives one best his career also amazing rightly deserved academy award powerhouse performance defense attorney
spencer tracy - burt lancaster maximilian schell montgomery clift richard widmark marlene dietrich judy garland ! can anyone find anything better ? one of the greatest films all time or best axel melhardt
a very nearly perfect film . watch it on video and use slo-mo stop action to analyse some of the scenes-- you'll be amazed by keaton's incredible timing unlike chaplin , keaton never asked you feel sorry for him he was always tough little guy who simply determined do his job does here perfection my nomination greatest silent films
buster keaton is one of my favorite actors all time hes great .
buster keaton's golden offering to the vaults of truly significant creations film comedy and perhaps all . it is still a wonder after 75 years
here buster keaton is a civil war confederate train driver,turned down for active service,who has to rescue his girlfriend and train( the general )stolen by dastardly union spies.when i first saw this classic enjoyed it but wondered what all fuss was about.on repeated viewings it's grown immeasurably i've no hesitation in placing among handful of all-time best comedies silents.despite its exciting plot,its pleasures are gentle understated,built gradually without hysterical showmanship.the historical details authentic.the wondrous comic timing looks effortless,the visual sense masterly there's neat classical symmetry.it may not have you rolling,but enormous charm;a lovely,noble,ingenious 80 minutes that makes life feel richer .
my favorite fonda movie . great cast , acting funny interesting and dramatic actors of today couldn't get it done in a remake
this is one of the greatest movies ever made . everything perfect , music art direction settings and acting harrison ford portrays most watchable movie hero in raiders lost ark 2 sequels also steven speilberg at his best which saying a lot
this was pretty intense . full of carnage and gave me a new arsenal insults
a 5 , just for james cagney on the speaker who did it it... .
a true classic ! jack lemmon shows the promise he later fulfills and james cagney is perfect floating tyrant . henry fonda , in title role handles his part with grace charm quiet intensity
truly entertaining . a real laugh and yet tugs at your heart the leads are well played by an interesting mix of those who past there acting prime (cagney) , in its midst (fonda) have to reach peak (lemmon) done
one of the best war movies ever made .
quite probably the best movie ever made . kirk douglas and adolphe menjou were never better , or nearly as good while kubrick's relentless pacing keeps one riveted to gripping story which highlights venality of war
wow what a movie this was . kirk douglas charcecter sure has heart and happened at the end made me cry that i thank our lord had in does not happen america one of best war movies ever !
stay with it til the final , cold frames . it's an incredible film and kirk douglas as dax is perfect !
world war i is one of the great under-studied wars all time , chock full its own unique hellish drama . can be paired with either quiet on western front (1930)- other greatest wwi film or kubrick's lesser (but still good) metal jacket ('87) set in vietnam
one of the greatest war movies all time.this is almost two in one.the second half after leaving bootcamp good but not as great first half.excellant soundtrak and score.this much better than platoon my opinion .
one of the top 2 or 3 war films all time .
one of chaplains most poignant films.it makes you laugh,it cry and it gives much to think about.hitler was furious at chaplain for lampooning him in this wonderful movie.bravo ! the speech he end is powerful speeches on war history .
not only was chaplin amazingly brave to make and release this movie , but it also very funny . he managed a mocking one of the most dangerous leaders in world hilarious that even hitler allowed be seen germany i recomend anyone who is either into history or classic laughtastic comedy
see it alone for the closing speech chaplin gives at end of film , where he rails against fascism and totalitarianism .
i really respect chaplin for having the presence of mind and heart to make this movie . it wasn't necessarily brave - hollywood was very anti-nazi at time compassionate him think plight jews presume what their fate would be he nailed adenoid/adolf , mussollini whole dirty group speaks itself one greatest examples tragi-comedy
one of my all-time favorites . outstanding comedy , featuring chaplin at his best as both the self-effacing barber and comically tyrannical dictator
this was an amazing picture which show not only charlie's diversity but his great perfection and comedy skills
whaaaaaat a movie ! best comedy...ever .
the citizen kane of comedies . chaplin's brilliance shines in every scene and intelligience writing is impeccable
loved it . have seen 3 times and will see another if given the chance
best movie of the 30s - it may be old , but it's still great see now
this movie has some of the best courtroom-dialogues ever thanks to colonel henry drummond (tracy) and matthew harrison brady(march) . i never saw gene kelly act good , he is as sharp wit in film if you are religious may make think
the 1925 scopes monkey trial on evolution in tennessee is populated by a galaxy of stars lead spencer tracy . this subject more relevant today than when movie was made 1960 stanley kramer directed
it's a tale that is part of mankind's history as well present . it speaks the intolerance man for viewpoints contrary to their beliefs about closed-mindedness and real chapter out america's , down nearly exact words from testimory william jennings bryan questioned by clarence darrow with frederick march spencer tracy portraying respectively what more can you ask movie one great plays in american theatre written robert e lee (no relation) jerome lawrence see it...it may change your thinking...it life
sterling and powerful performances by spencer tracy frederic march . gene kelly dick york are wonderful too
one of the best films all time . great actors (spencer tracy , frederic march and even gene kelly are really marvellous) a story
a great movie . jack lemmon if perfect as the guy who works for huge office.he lets other men use his apartment affairs in hope of promotion one he is big wigs played by fred macmurray{playing creep this time} woman has an affair with shirley macclaine , jacks character really likes ends up helping her out during very low point life now wants himself even it means no and going against boss well acted all around especially put upon
this is a very well crafted as entertaining movie . it unique blend of comedy with total seriousness filled running gags , some which are subtle if you don't watch and listen closely may miss the first time around then other parts emotional intense though deals subject marital infidelity does not put in positive light shows for destructive vice that my opinion director billy wilder's best jack lemmon's performance shirley maclaine's
even allowing for the recent relative neglect of hitchcock's british films(compared to some ever more acclaimed later american masterpieces),i'm still a bit disappointed this doesn't have higher rating it deserves.its characteristic hitchcock theme innocent man who finds himself on run then embroiled with spy ring is most reminiscent north by west,and it's almost as enjoyable- loaded maestro's usual cinematic flair,a typically brilliant mix humour and suspense,and at times surprisingly sexy period.of course hitch was always fond tease.it's my (and many others')personal favourite pre-war classic .
a great thriller - truly classic for this genre
this is a delightful film ! from the sheer horror of death in hannay's flat , to comic exchange where robert donat says for all you know i might murder woman week  and chilling bit when one character holds up his truncated finger these make compendium hitchcock touches please many fans .
as a fan of early hitchcock , this is one his best . though it may be bit rough in places has all the camera angles snappy dialoge and great suspense that made famous flick
as good the book.. . my favorite bit of editing is jump from scene where body found to train
howard hawks directed this western mutiny on the bounty with john wayne and montgomery clift in leading roles . really could be duke's top acting performance an historic cattle drive
truly a spectacular film . it has an umatched blend of tragedy and comedy , romance drama this also was one chaplain's last attempts to bring the fall talkies not mention picture which only stared but directed by little tramp proved chaplain can do more than just simple slapstick
this is a real masterpiece . not only one of the best movies about judgments in history but i ve ever seen incredible group characters performed by actors like james stewart , ben gazzara or beautiful lee remick preminger doesn t need to show you more than minute for know them well that s classic cinema fine camera movements great use time (not videoclips we are used see these days) and marvellous script flashbacks order give subjective information what happened thanks say can believe it intelligent because at end still supposse happened! if haven go look it! promise won regret
hilarious film with the two greats walter matthau and jack lemmon . is oscar slob while felix complete opposite an anal retentive obsessive neat freak are both hysterical , but i find to be funnier especially in a restraunt scene(as molfan so rightly pointed out) when has clear his nose he makes awful noise it's classic movie was well made comedy that one can watch over
this movie is great .
an extraordinary film about the destructive force that one simple lie can yield in poisoning friendships , ruining careers and destroying lives [program note : this 1961 classic will be shown twice next month april 2005 on turner movies channel] . although it is a sobering account at times somewhat heavy-handed few films i've seen recent yrs pack wallap does highly recommended
this is the good cape fear edition as opposed to goofy done by scorsese in 1991 . i guess only thing wrong with 1962 that it doesn't splatter blood everywhere robert mitchum a real fearsome villain over top de niro more recent version
by far the superior version , mitchum is chilling and surpasses de niro's reprise of same role .
the remake was ok , but it can't hold a candle to original . robert mitchem played one of meanest vindictive characters in this movie
this is one of the best classical movies ever . it feautures an all-star performance by robert mithcum who definitely at his creepiest also stars film legend gregory peck , along with telly savalas and martin balsam has loads suspense some acting filmed a definite must see for all movie fans young or old
barbara stanwyck in here greatest role , and she was not even nominated for an oscar unbelievable! ! i cannot understand why no one else has voted this great film my favourite comedy of all time
there's nothing sugar coated about this stanley kubrick classic . boot camp was really that brutal it's too bad bleeding heart liberals and pc hungry officials don't mkae the same today truly most unforgettable movie character of all time - lee ermy as gunnery sgt hartman
a fun and charming movie .
elizabeth taylor's best screen performance . sexy , seductive passionate and vicious
this movie , staring elizabeth taylor and paul newman was incredible . derived from the play by tennessee williams it inspirational filled me with a burning desire to live ps burl ives who plays big daddy
another great classic and an even better read (as usual) . big momma , daddy sister woman! ! how can you not like a movie that uses nicknames paul's as usual does job too (whoever guy was?) to forget elizabeth taylor. we're so used seeing her the way she is now acting role of kinda quirky friend michael jackson it's easy was pretty talented quite head turner
one of my favorite movies . jim was so nice to plato , and i cried at the end when got shot
james dean is a god !
this is my favorite james dean film and i must say a great screenplay which showed people the true minds of teenagers in time when that wasn't commonly done .
james dean reminds me of myself , when i was growing up . it a fast paced movie with youthful rebellious attitude towards society and especially in regard for the law
interesting because in the 50s from that perspective , it showed how kids did wrong but a modern we can see family problems .
kubrik is insane ! he's also a genius , i've loved every one of his movies including this . insanly bad ass
i love this movie .
this is an excellent (and inspirational) story of a family on the homefront during world war two . i say film worthwhile way to spend three hours forget popcorn , and have some tissues handy !
this is the great john ford monument valley movie ! it made wayne a star and western genre . thomas mitchell won an oscar as drunken doctor andy devine some of other players shine
this is such a great classic john wayne movie . he was gentlemen to the ladies especiall on train ride it very good...
all great westerns used this film as a guide . truly innovative that was the mold for to follow duke stole show in supporting role and his career followed catapulted from very entertaining western
john ford's classic western with wayne is still worth seeing and deserving of 5 stars after all this time . the benchmark against which other westerns are measured
excellent , powerful movie . richard burton and elizabeth don't hold anything back as george martha they go after each other with everything got one of the most volatile couples on screen
liz taylor and richard burton rip through the script each other in a loud messy movie . great stuff you have to wonder if george martha's relationship didn't mirror their own some extent
aaaaahhhhh!!!! !
who's affraid of virginia voolf ? - one the best american movies/ beautiful producing , beautifulactors works very delicate music and artist work . all done exactly nothing superfluous not any unwarrantable external effects concentrated on disclosure theme imagines i know so much films whichcan becompared with it in depth psychological analysis reslization
while visiting my 78-year old dad , we watched it on amc . unbeknownst to me pop seems have this movie a dozen times and knew every line scene like so many rocky horror revelers though i am not the biggest john wayne fan one is great veiled sexuality between sizzling hot red-head acollene maureen o'hara palpable -- even in 1952 was neat when confides very discreet issue their inability consummate marriage with town priest (ward bond) gaelic victor mclaglan duke of best hollywood fights history irish locales are visually stunning overall real treat glad share pops seek out
one of john wayne's top 2 or 3 , rivaled only by the searchers.the scenery was excellent in this film and costar o'hara at her typical best .
a great movie , by the master john ford with wonderful red-head maureen o'hara and wayne more touching sexy than he's never been (through his wet shirt...) don't miss it
i am a huge hitchcock fan myself , and this is my favoite film by him . the script fantastic acting flawless joseph cotten was amazing as uncle charlie way he gradually turns into sinister character at his finest for any who has not seen do yourself favor pick it up
shadow of a doubt is one hitchcock's greatest films , without question . everything from the superb camera shots and angles to brillant story-telling makes this winner it has ; comedy budding love affair uncle charly portrayed by joseph cotten can't get any better than !
the small town setting definitely adds to appeal of this picture . everything seems so normal before uncle charlie's sinister arrival having said that , characters are delightfully eccentric - i especially like banter between whodunnit experts but whole cast pleases script contains some real gems incidentally almost ten years later two leads joseph cotten and teresa wright were as a married couple in an entertaining little thriller steel trap 
i can see why this is hitchcock's favorite film ! it's one of mine too cotten effectively sinister while wright the perfect counterpart for his uncle charlie . after , there was no turning back hitchcock on way to becoming best filmmaker in business
i both loved and hated this movie . it really was the beginning of modern hollywood detail remarkable : makeup , costumes sound fake backgrounds everything so detailed controlled had a believable historic plot also liked obvious homo-erotic twist adoring kid director clearly gay that tough guy based on is true irony because set pace for sentimental crap now prevails from am very glad to see kevin costner reference
one of the best movies about viet nam war , it was also a great look into what like to be u.s . marine and all honour attached
beautiful colors , good performances and the best story of a guy that looks bad an intelligent western commenting historical situation(lambs vs.cows) .
'charade' is one fantastic movie , and yet it very underrated . watching this the viewers are treated to great visuals acting what a cast : audrey hepburn cary grant james coburn walter matthau george kennedy finally suspenseful from beginning until end (reminiscent of hitchcock flick) as hepburn's widowed regina lambert doesn't know who turn for help if anyone cares watch i promise they will not be disappointed
wow , lookit all the comments for this movie . looks like it's up to me say something :) i found a real treat pretty much everybody as far twists and turns go you really can't do better...although never did process who cary grant ended being (was it thadius ? was right?) audrey hepburn is particularly good in she makes work i'm fourteen years old so don't tell movie's people ! highly recommend buy right now!
absolutely for everyone . my kids watched this over and when they were little , i never had to fast-forward it past any trashy parts...hard find one like that these days topol is tevya !
great ! but only if seen in a theatre , on large screen . it reaches the heights humor tragedy and fun at various times
i loved this movie . it does a great job of showing what life was like in the jewish communities russia 1800's is both humorous and dramatic
this is , i think the best war movie ever made . had to struggle with idea that paths of glory was better when said but they both come from kubrick so make your own decision point direction all a combat correspondant could hope for it may not be what should in cinema read book based on and while there are differences flows as well novel ; division bewteen boot camp sequences battlefield essential illustrate horror degrading terrible things man must put himself through get essentially couple if you look at sniper final run metaphor enemy  becomes more profound ultimately i've watched many can't one recommend sans politics propaganda than
this is an absolutely incredible movie! !
the greatest of rebellion-for-the-hell-of-it movies . a film that has influenced lives and gone down in american lexicon as representation counter-culture lifestyle peter fonda dennis hopper unforgettable roles , jack nicholson made him star it also given us one great images posing on bikes while holy modal rounders' if you want to be bird plays all for ages
a true classic! ! the sixties summed up in movie just shut and take it
easy rider is indeed a must-see 1960's homage to the free spirit of that particular decade . peter fonda and dennis hopper play two leading heroes who are setting out on their bikes conquer ugly face prejudice jack nicholson serves as scenestealer here , representing how ignorance can be molded away with correct attitude extremely funny moving interesting ultimately raw film experience what fan-freaking-tastic trip scene yet matched in cinema killer soundtrack well
very weird 60's film with peter fonda , dennis hopper and jack nicholson . its a free roaming plotline - intruiging camera work sound nicholson's character drinking the whisky is fantastic ! great gorgeous motorbikes
'giant' . the name speaks for itself edna ferber wrote novel , and george stevens directed this movie perhaps only thing wrong with is its immense length otherwise a landmark it especially poignant because james dean's last anyone who has seen can never erase from memory final dean sequence where his character jett rink drunk alone in ballroom making speech piece of acting lends to myth how much untapped potential possessed let's not forget memorable cast including rock hudson elizabeth taylor (who gives one her great performances ever) when all said done there be no denying that definitely ages
marty is a wonderful movie . ernest borgnine plays plain looking man who in his thirties he lives with italian mother lonely has never really had girlfriend all of siblings have married and left the family home one night goes to dance hall meets sweet,but also woman.his two buddies {who are not married} try wreck relationship newfound terrific nice guy finally chance for own happiness decide whether follow heart go this girl or let others pressure him agains it p.s happy ending won an oscar both best actor those quiet little movies that did make big splash at but great
a simple , searingly honest film the kind that current hollywood filmmakers have evidently forgotten how to make.. . must viewing for any classic fan marty is with message about intolerant society can often be towards those who - whatever reason don't couple up after certain age again and at start of central character assaulted by shrill abrasive demeaning words you're still single ? you should ashamed yourself!...by customers/aquaintances his place work (butchershop) but instead telling them proverbially shove it he takes their heart as result feels increasingly lonely distraught alienated hopeless life me seems like quinessential 1950's captures period it's attitudes style well within an urban setting highly recommended young old alike
very heartfelt - a tearjerker too . you really , feel for marty and his girl even when he screws up from being so rusty it never casts dim light on women though it's told the man's perspective well let me amend that mother aunt are nuts but other than this movie is great character study everyone will sympathize with
ernest borgnine is incredible as the sensitive title character . this movie has a lot to say and does it so well through few characters
the late , great paul muni takes on screws screwy dames and plenty of hounds while escaping a brutal chain gang ,which he was sentenced to after being framed . this movie original cool hand luke which lacked choir one had
eli wallach's debut in a sizzler with carroll baker directed by elia kazan .
possibly the best "western" ever made .
i liked this a lot more thirty years ago and maybe it has sunk to less than five spot , but newman jackie gleason george c . scott piper laurie really still shine followed many later by color of money
they should've quit while ahead and not made the sequel . there was no reason for color of money to have won any awards when compared with original
this is one of my all-time favorite movies , but as irishgit says not a feel-good movie and so for everyone . dustin hoffman jon voight are street people who form an unlikely team the packed with affecting scenes like where caught stealing food at chic party instead calling cops hosts merely ask them why they trying to make off helping themselves other guests end heartbreaking
very well crafted movie , that stands up pretty . great performance by hoffman and voight is strong worth seeing but it isn't for everyone
another kubrick masterpiece . r lee ermey totally makes the film what it is by doing a fantastic performance as drill instructor
wow is this a depressing movie . sometimes you want get bummed out , and just the to do it i remember hearing that was x rated when won best picture in 1969 or so its tough imagine why got rating can only how disappointing some rowdy young adults were they went see an adult heart wrenching arty drama instead kinda like bart simpson's pals headed off r chanting bar-ton-fink !  not knowing what store for them...
wow . absolutely phenomenal some people can't stand to leave their shiny , happy lives for ten minutes cause so afraid of what they might find this explains the bad reviews
stupendous ! they rarely make films of this caliber anymore.first rate acting,great cinematography and loads atmosphere .
this movie is for anyone who accused of being crazy(and isn't).charles boyer and ingrid bergman are at their best .
i do adore stanley kubrick films and its a shame he's no longer with us . found this film very disturbing in places then bit lighthearted it does make you think about the atrocities of war shows what happened vietnam are always most realistic as was first media , general public america actually saw veterans protested an absolutely disgusting lot young innocent men paid for their lives
charles laughton , good quassi part but that hump oooooh must have had so much trouble getting fitted for a suit tailors nightmare to see him come into the shop......couldn't buy one of peg that's sure.... .
this movie always broke my heart . i felt so sorry for the poor hunchback and hated ones who were cruel to him
sanctuary ! good final comment by medgar evers below .
by the way , this refers to 1939 version of victor hugo's landmark novel . charles laughton's make-up and acting are a knockout.alfred newman's score is one best 30s great visuals storytelling
based on victor hugo's novel , this one definitely goes down as a classic . the make-up work quasimodo's face is so well done- haunting to look at today imagine what it looked like people 80 years ago ! scenes of torture are dramatic and most acting excellent not everyone knows however that real story ends with an image quasimodo esmerelda's decaying skeletons holding each other..
great film . gregory peck , david niven anthony quinn and others on a greek island fighting the germans
one of the greatest wwii movies all time .
paul schofield won the oscar for his portrayal of thomas more , a man integrity faith and courage in facing henry viii . (you know all about good king hank don't you?)
great film which has been restored . there is a shorter dubbed version with runny colour floating around don't watch that one see the three and half hours or so performance by burt lancaster , probably his best
considered to be an essential classic outside the english-speaking world (where it was cut and poorly dubbed upon its release) , leopard is a brilliant depiction of italian/ sicilian aristocracy in decline rising bourgeoisie . despite being very long slow-moving film beautiful watch makes interesting philosphical reflections both at political personal level burt lancaster gives majestic performance (one his best) as aging aristocrat who must come terms with changing values social structures not for die-hard action fans but great movie nevertheless !
tony curtis and sidney poitier truly deserved their academy award nominations in roles as the defiant ones (as did brilliant screenplay cinematography) . through conflicting relationship evolving friendship two convicts on run , expose common prejudices against black people humanistic message of story is delivered a touching believable non-preachy manner less pretentious obvious than many movies dealing with racial issues which would follow
one of the first and best movies about racial conflicts . a classic gem
this is one of the better horror films ever made . lon chaney bitten by a werewolf played bela lugosi he carries curse and then during full moon , oh you know what claude rains plays chaney's father great part maria ouspenskaya who old gypsy fortells fate attempts to care for him i can't explain in brief space how well done flick even special effects make-up are first rate date movie 1941 can sympathesize with wolf man really feel sorry fact don't miss if have chance see it !
it's a shame they don't make horror movies like this any more . the monster isn't bad guy who is mega-evil and impossible to dispose of , he's one can feel sympathy for these from 30's 40's are great watching on or near halloween
funny and heartwarming , this dramedy was based on the book (which i enjoyed as well) . like part where anne oldest daughter gets daring cuts her long hair into a shorter 'do (desiring to fit in with fashion fads of era) which shocks angers dad recommend classic program people all ages --it's entertaining completely guilt-free
ok , this is it ! the new cheaper by dozen was not a remake of original . they are nothing alike and steve martin movie imo total flop my number one favorite comedy true story about family with 12 children clifton webb very fine old actor plays frank gilbreth father (who well know efficiency expert) if you haven't seen please give yourself couple hours sheer quality entertainment get i promise will be disappointed
what a very romantic and lovely movie . the girl lead sure needed reality check i felt for boy he had loving heart wish there not so many girls in world who was like from this happy , sad all one great package ! reccomend anyone is romantically love or ever has been
another sad , tragic classic ! a story of forbidden love between woman the upper class and man no family . however is enduring even in death last scene shot over sweeping moors surreal tear-jerker
i loved this movie .
this is one crazy movie . it gives the viewer an inside look at what boot camp for marines like there are moments where your mind will be blown away by has just happened never ceases to amaze
james whale proves why he is the greatest director of horror films with invisible man . claude rains was perfect choice for one considering that fact acted almost completely his voice and what a it !
i bought this on dvd and hadn't seen it for years . you must watch is such a riveting story the robert blake connection , in light of modern happenings fascinating truman capote book well done
nowhere is charlie chaplin's true genius more evident than in this perceptive avant-garde critique of modern , machine-age society . his great achievement however to make us laugh and cry while dealing with a serious philosophical subject
unusual john ford movie in the pacific . dorothy lamour , raymond massey thomas mitchell etc hurricaine special effects (1937) really have never been equalled
sam peckinpah directed . this is bloody sam's best film william holden , ernest borgnine and most of the stable character actors portray a gang old outlaws who want to pull one last job then retire
this movie was way ahead of its time . peckinpah never better and the old guys in cast were like watching a great boxer making comeback-succesfully
a violent , nihilistic film about the death of west . main cast is played by aging tired looking actors who perfectly fit theme wanting to quit they are as was macbeth so deeply steeped in blood that returning would be harder tatn going on
one of the best westers ever made ! peckinpah's tale 4 men on a mission is still influential today , john woo and tarantino owe him huge debt . just look at his use violence slow motion for proof excellent cast gorgeous cinematography shot with great style
this is the best movie about vietnam war to come out of hollywood . kubrick's meticulous analysis military conditioning a stark condemnation american ideologies that caused holocaust in vincent d'onofrio's chilling portrayal mentally disturbed soldier reason enough see film
not only is this one of the artistic westerns , it includes great acting and mind-blowing editing ultraviolent killing scenes . greatest its era
this was my first horror film . dad took me to see it the creature must have made home in trunk of car and hid dad's shop basement used skin knees scurrying up stairs so he wouldn't grab ankles..
coop is an american fighting for the reds in republican spain this rendition of hemingway novel . ingrid begman lovely , but casting her as a spaniard ?
one of the all time great films in american history ! henry fonda is wyatt earp . this low key film leads inevitably up to gunfight at ok corral many john ford stable players show
james cagney is perfect as george m . cohan the song and dance man from late 1980s to about 1940 this movie cohan's life i did not realize what a great dancer was until movie.it has lot of good scenes one better biography movies have seen
james cagney really shows his acting chops in this movie about george m cohan . an entertaining musical and puts all into it he's touching , delightful electryfing walter huston is great as father jerry won academy award for performance the will not disappoint
i haven't seen this movie until recently and even though the effects are not best have ever , still appreciate it . story was original a any person can watch also detailed like book very eloquently done
one of the most wonderful works film to ever exist . kubrick's direction is as it's absolute finest throughout this extremely inspiring and provoking several ends it a torrent two hours spent watching movie that will torment distrub your psyche when over , you leave with such renewed passion frustrate not knowing what do yourself newfound spirit
one of my all-time favorites...cagney was the best , by his own admission he simply a song dance man ...this movie actually george m . cohen story and cagney born for part there are some great songs dancing (nobody made it look easier than jimmy with rubbery legs) nicely told true american hero
cagney's best musical role .
rita hayworth was quite a babe in this . that hair-tossing scene is classic
this film was made soley for rita hayworth . (gilda) provocative and seductive like no actress before or since a must see
this was an exciting , yet depressing view of vietnam . i love movie one stanley kubrick's best films
rosalind russell did a great job playing auntie mame . patrick dennis wrote book about his love of life aunt this movie is well done when has to come and live with after the death father unique woman who throws parties just because it today she for whole bunch eccentric friends starts around start depression ends grown ready marry.the wrong person rich spoiled brat , freinds helps realize snotty girl would be marry.a good some actors
i love the upson's visit with auntie mame .
life is a banquet and this movie really makes you smile . rosaline russell was fabulous !
by far the best movie ever made . rosalind russel gave her performance in this wonderful i love bright colors , magnificent sets and inventive situations don't understand how is rated number 106...help us get it to 1 !
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen , also most unusual ones . robert young and dorothy mcguire star in it won't even try to review because would give away secret that makes movie so special sometime when you a lazy day rent well worth time
shows what a great director like howard hawks could do with tiny budget , b-movie cast and some cheap special effects . another one of those movies that should not be remade because they'll never it better than the original mostly-unseen monster (actually james arness in carrot suit)anticipates from id forbidden planet even shark jaws lots snappy patter overlapping dialogue smart dames tough guys sci-fi has rarely been done or more fun
the thing from another world is a great science fiction film , possibly greatest of all films 1950s . sure we don't see much but his presence there very thought that could come around corner or through wall at any moment frightening and i can imagine how kids movie-goers felt when they saw this on big screen for first time love movie
unquestionably one of the greatest 50s sci-fi movies all time ! although there aren't many scenes with monster , his presence is extremely powerful through-out entire film this a must-see for any die-hard fan science fiction . hell it's anyone who loves
full metal jacket is one of the best war movies . it so realisitc and by showing some gruesome effects , gets point across on how crazy might have been
burt lancaster is in his film debut this hemingway story about the criminal investigation of a murdered boxer . lots other good folks including ava gardner
this is my favorite military / nuclear war satire as well peter sellers film . people who are fans of kind movie know that in 1964 dr strangelove , another had playing multiple roles but five years earlier 1959 also played (and similar) the mouse roared was made during height cold when bombs air raid drills and possible invasions were a part american life smallest country world duchy grand fenwick has one means income wine called pinot sold chiefly to united states california maker puts out an imitation calls it enwick on edge financial ruin protests u.s government ignored however taken notice whenever loses with sends aid rebuild which they have defeated duchess gloriana (peter sellers) explains all i said before there no more profitable sound step for nation without money or credit take than declare unites suffer total defeat then declares chief forest ranger tully bascombe (again gathers army about twenty longbowmen charters tugboat invade new york city intending surrender quickly luck would entire deserted everyone underground test because scientist kokintz his secret weapon q-bomb within limits wanders around looking someone spotted by civil defense team mistakes them aliens from outer space due their 14th century uniforms end up at institute advanced physics where professor built working model captures daughter general four policemen arrive back inform won instead losing heads panic resign prime minister form league little nations every small neutral offers protect against any attacks resolve matter surrenders hold talks will be off market demands million dollars negotiator insists may billion keep russia disarmament supervised if doesn't happen threaten explode bomb president asks secretary do you believe they'd really ? answers believed landing manhattan chartered sailing vessel clever many comparisons great understanding human nature depicted characters particularly refuses marry she americans cruel wives treat equals refuse make decision consulting load worries should themselves isn't enough send work earning own efforts am want husband man let me woman i'll able handle him better way bit much far lighthearted good family entertainment excellent not only still funny it's relevant even 21st time favorites indeed
this is my absolute favorite of james dean s three films . his magnificent portrayal the disturbed twin cal so deeply compelling and believable i actually ached for him need to gain acceptance love from parents (wonderfully played by raymond massey jo van fleet) a universal theme , which nearly anyone can identify with it pulls viewer in start brief but sweet story between abra (julie harris) extremely moving one most intense have ever seen depicted on screen conveys more feeling passion their kiss ferris wheel than dozen graphic scenes could movie posses very winning combination great directing writing stellar cast remarkable ability create timeless characters all these points combine provide rare opportunity enter experience an excellent piece classic literature

this is a great movie . the surrealistic point of view showcases physical and psychological brutality vietnam war stanley kubrick displays gallery motley characters soldiers , prostitutes fanatical drill sergeant all backed up by wonderful soundtrack
fantastic film that offers some great chills . it stars vincent price at his most scary and perverse in this tale of dark evilness the rope scene is simply chilling along with organ music go get tonight
love these movies , similar to the old steve reeves hercules)..... .
the special effects are still impressive today . this movie was 50's equivalent to 70's star wars ray harryhausen at his best
one of the best film noir ever made , supsenseful moody wonderfully directed with extremely smooth witty dialogue and a superb performance by young robert mitchum in his first starring roles .
it's a top , notch movie! !
this is a 3 hour plus joyride that both fun and funny . each actor involved brings their own brand of timeless humor to charactor , culminating in an american comedy classic
classic movie with histories best comedians , what more could you want . sid caeser is amazing in the film right along mickey rooney and phil silvers it's funny first time watch it laughter never stops no matter how many times will always make laugh
no matter how many times you watch it , will never stop laughing . the all star cast is great and plot so unbelievable that just keep coming back for more characters have weak pathetic attempts at finding money some scenes in film die whenever need a good laugh i can guarentee always remember this
classic bette davis . she's creepy and wonderful as the monster turned savior great build-up ending
bette davis is one of the finest actresses her time...and she really overshadows many todays as well.the nanny was very scary to me a child . because this movie , i have hooked on davis`s movies and never been disapointed
i never thought would like a movie about boy and fisherman.i ended up loving this . freddie bartholomew plays who is rich spoiled rotten he on ship with his dad when falls overboard rescued by fisherman played spencer tracy was back in the 1930s fishing boat has no way of contacting people , harvey ends for next three months becomes friends manuel man him to earn keep it starts out rocky since brat but eventually changes into more responisble well behaved child what especially love friendship between toward end there tragedy.{a tear jerker} very done perfect as good definite classic

full metal jacket is a good movie showing the vietnam war . it showed how people survived in and what happened through soldier's eye
without a doubt , the best lana turner movie . i loved madame x but this one to me is her performance it has some of saddest scenes and no matter how many times have watched still cry during those story rise struggling actress housekeeper who most faithful person in life tells each them heartaches they endured wonderful old classic
always thought this was one of the best classic scary movies for its sheer monstrosity and scale destruction . people who made it originally in '54 were only 11 years past being nuked ! they knew something about monstrous terror film an apt metaphor dealing with forces nature unleashed
still the best giant monster movie even with dubbing and cut footage from original 1954 japanese version . raymond burr is quite good in this american , it was first to scare me as a kid at same time enthrall i can watch over today 31 years old get feelings gave back when saw 8
hella funny how the dude blew his head off . marines were great it was very realistic i liked story a lot
all hail the real godzilla!!!! !
dark , intense gritty these are just a few of the adjectives i'd used to describe this little-known 1965 classic hill . film - shot in black and white depicts corruption sadistic abuse prisoners who treated as barbaric animals held captive inside slaughterhouse/british military prison region northern africa sean connory plays protagonist perhaps finest acting effort his entire career opinion well ! title refers huge steep mound compacted dirt on which subjects forced tread up down continuously carrying heavy sandbags beneath hot blistering desert sun
the comedy of sinister , impeccable manners as louis d'ascoygne (dennis price) fulfills in his own way late mother's wish that he inherit family fortune enacting indiscriminate and caculated revenge upon a half-dozen members all whom stand between himself inheritance . alec guinness portrays parts eight victims is remarkable enough but one lesser delights price character psychotic obsession joan greenwood (also wonderful oscar wilde's 'the importance being earnest' 1952) teaches comediennes thing or two about playing role seductive blackmailing adulteress who also happens to be object louis' desire (that's right) wilde well chesterton woodehouse knew british nothing if not collusion characters eccentric batty
great story ! excellent performances sydney pollack directs all to terrific results gig young as the promoter , won an oscar for best supporting actor . in marathon dance contests,the dancers are pushed their limits indeed susannah york has a harrowing scene dancer who went mad it her nomination actress (she lost goldie hawn cactus flower) when one ponders times of big depression can understand desperation that would drive enter these contests and there were always people exploited vulnerability
the absurdly riotious group known collectively as monty python in their first (and what most agree is best) film , 1975 release . "monty and holy grail," certainly team's well  financially successful oft quoted venture "the grail" was shot on a shoestring budget over period of about forty days with cast crew braving often brutally cold rainy inhospitable scottish weather consisting string skits woven together around concept tracing band noble crusaders enlisted by king arthur britain direct orders from almighty to find cup used jesus at last supper (i'm not sure why big guy being all knowing couldn't it for himself.) graham chapman plays role ably assisted terry gilliam his coconut clapping knave patsy each pythons appear multiple roles jones playing sir bedevere john cleese lancelot ("the brave") michael palin galahad pure") eric idle robin not-so-brave-as lancelot") adventures both alone allowed far larger audience exposure paved way international superstardom unit became own right making largest impact via "all you need cash" featuring legendary make believe english pop rutles hilarious spoof beatles (with blessing cameo george harrison who great friend idle's who's money later projects including 'the life brian" others were made) american television 1978 has appeared number currently found new traveling comedy revue scored british series 'falty towers' "a fish called wanda" becoming pitch man may be seen hawking variety products commercials died cancer october 1989 continues write act occasionally directs movies treks across globe climbing highest mountains sailing deepest seas this troupe's high water mark get them mistaken other wide mouthed passer's very day
this is my personal favorite kubrick film , but in opinion it two films one . the first dealing with private pile probably most accurate depiction of marine training ever done a great anti-war and stays true to kubrick's surreal style
this is my favourite comedy movie and im not a python fan but i seen could stop laughing did get all the jokes it doesnt really matter there are so many gags going on at once theres always something that keeps you amused(in fits of uncontrolable laughter) everytime see find more little in background true masterpiece . if like will watch again
gotta love it . my second favorite of the monty python movies (first still is "the meaning life" i know most would disagree with me on that one , but oh well) can't go wrong limbless black knight vicious little white bunnies and holy hand grenades for truly nerdy amongst us (  admit it) if you want to air speed velocity an unladen swallow (of european variety) can find your answer here : http://www.style.org/unladenswallow/ what african variety sorry you're own.)
one of the greatest , wittiest and most absurd comedies ever . i've seen it i don't know how many times absolutely hysterical their peak in my view
much like a pampered bordeaux , this film just gets better with age . perhaps its the latent cinematographer in me but i always found way it was shot to be fascinating (that low-light grainy murkiness lending dark flavor every scene) and opening score incredible at establishing most notorious mood swing (daunting dread silly symphony) ever recorded sure helps into absurd sight gags truly appreciate grail ; luckily one of best comedy troupes formed able pull off so many them setting (and on frayed shoestring budget) start sorely-missed graham chapman's king arthur (accompanied by coconut-clomping patsy animator terry gilliam) ornithological lessons first castle political persuasions mud-gathering peasants ("ah now we see violence inherent system!") crazed bravery black knight witch-burning mob dullards gorilla's hand that turns book pages musical fun camelot ("it's only model") abrasive french guards galahad's encounter zoot her "eight-score blondes brunettes ages 16 through 19-and-a-half" anthrax lancelot's wedding-day rescue forlorn songsmith herbert robin's minstrels their comestible fate wilderness ("and there rejoicing.....yaaaay!") knights who say "nee" landscaping assignments included roger shrubber thick-accented tim enchanter foul-tempered rodent defended cave cair bannog brother maynard holy grenade antioch bridge death overlooking gorge eternal peril arrests made ending : not single misfire among lot 'em ! drooling fan or you have credit something enough staying power inspire broadway 30 years after release summit british contributions artform
i would have to agree with canadasucks , as it may be getting a bit old but the movie still has some of most quotable lines any comedy ever created . there's too many list here ranks among top comedies all time
best movie ever funnyest thing in the world whoever disagrees will suffer
the holy hand grenade was best . monty python is comedy ever !
perfection monty python style .
i just got a shirt the other day with black knight out any limbs and in big red letters it says " its flesh wound" ppl ofmonty python are truly amazing . gods of comedy no where else could having monster be defeated because animator died heart attck wehre would have failed not monty pulled off , they rock for
i enjoyed seeing that side of war , being able to see the unity soldiers had develop with each was interesting . think in today's world people need have a sense teamwork
bring forth the holy hand grenade . you gotta be a fan to get some of gags , but they hold up well i just saw it again other day
what...is you favorite color ? yep , another movie that can start a flurry of quotes aren't funny in any other form . hilarious if are python fan
some of th funniest moments ever caught on film . from the opening credits (changing several times) to final arrest , you learn expect unexpected even after all these years it is a pleasure watch each scene sketch into itself and put together makes one funny movie
very funny indeed . full of sarcastic lines and daft situations with the highest quotability rating any monty python film first time you see ending stare open mouthed for a couple fo munites before bursting out laughing genius
another senseless , idiotic yet hysterical movie .
one of the funniest movies ever put on film . knights who say ni and come back here i'll bite yur legs off almost as funny www.tuesdayswithmantu.com
the french taunter is classic .
all sorts of great , british odd witty fun!!!! ! you really will laugh unless have no sense humor or are terribly boring . there so many good one liners and puns i can't even tell the best scenes galahad pure run away little troll man at bridge movie it comes highly recommended
i though this movie was good because the story seemed to portray war life during vietnam . some of characters were very original my friends and have seen that about three times
she turned me into a newt....i got better
what can you say ! a classic . the best scene is when arthur takes on black knight , no two scenes are and bridge wait three lancelot rescues damsel well he not really damsal i mean to  four .... st loony's up creek bun & jam!
easily the funniest movie i have ever seen . it is perfectly tailored to my sense of humor also free raunchy jokes you see in so many modern comedies this pure comic genius
the anthem of 21st century techno-geek (like me :) ! great movie , terribly funny . i'm not a fan english comedy but this is shining exception
the funniest movie of all time . an undisputed heavyweight in world comedy slapstick galore full or random and hilarious events even opening credits are funny ! i won't begin to list parts this , as there way too many just trust me you will do yourself a huge favor if rent buying it would not hurt either
a great movie . probably the funniest i have ever seen love coconut bit and french taunting your mother was hamster , father smelt of elderberries !
this movie is wicked hilarious . it's impossible not to laugh at least once during a sitting , and some of the gags have gone down as classics i'd like see you try quote it after seeing heh
one of the best movies ever and my favorates . loved indiana jones trilogy this movie was three a true masterpiece ford establishes nice character to kind you can't just see once
this movie is badass for its time . it made you feel like were there , how coldhearted vietnam was
hilarious and nonstop fun in this one with the colorful ingenius british humor . of my favorite parts is when arthur talks to a group mud piling peasants forming socialist collective who could ever forget classic 'horse riding' ?
one of the funniest movies i have ever seen . it was so cheaply made that even funnier
released in 1974 , monty python and the holy grail is first film from famed british comedy troupe . this movie not for everyone as humor a specific taste very low production screenplay irreverent full of odd animation story has our group comedians graham chapman john cleese terry gilliam eric idle jones michael palin playing king arthur his knights they tackle life during middle ages search classic lines non-sequiturs it rapidly fluctuates back forth mundane (eg bantering political theory with peasants deciding on how to spot witch) grandiose trojan rabbit magically guarded bridge) much like arthurian legends themselves collection related short stories various go their separate quests then reunite final challenge an abrupt conclusion bottom line that become cult right passage must be seen at least once
its the most amazingly innocent-humoured fil ever ! there are some classic characters (the black knight , nights who say neep killer rabbit,) and just an azaming experience! i would recommend it to anyone
a very funny movie ! i like the killer bunny and rude insulting french knights
funny !
one of the funniest movies ever . people who think this is poor humour are just to serious find comedy in deadly white rabbit , and all other hilarious scenes i mean come on they launced a cow off catapult ! that
never seen anything like it ! sir robin ran away did not
this is one of the classic comedies our time . it was so wierd and didn't make any sense i normally don't like movies but just couldn't help laughing at how strage story !
funniest movie of all time!!!! ! i cut your bloody arm off .
a fantastic movie whose humour is still relevant to this day . some of the greatest lines and characters in comedic history you can't mention public without someone quoting part best that ever survived french taunting !
very silly movie . its got alot of hilarious parts you can give this a rent if feel like seeing it the part with black knight was best
a duck!! !
good on ya mate
this movie is absolutely the funniest of all-time . classic moments never end instead playing by rules , python lot always seem to go in an all out rebellion against common sense how many people could ever have concieved a political discussion about knights comic devices used film continue be unrivaled but life brian it clear from that pythons were true comedic masters their time
hilarious , and like any great comedy appeals to both the lowbrow highbrow . one of classics i fart in your general direction
a kubrick classic . i have friend who can recite whole speeches from this movie the dialogue in is amazing it really great war
it is the funniest movie i have ever seen with so many great scenes , and highly quote-able . it's just a flesh wound lol
one of the funniest movies ever made . it has that marvelous quality having jokes and gags by all rights shouldn't be funny , but for some reason make you laugh so hard fear to foul your pants not many people realize a lot film is parody ingmar bergman's _the seventh seal_ extra laughs watch bergman first : then when grail pay special attention bring out dead flagellants witch scene absolute masterpiece
this is the best monty python movie of them all .
this just may be the funniest movie ever made . no matter how many times i watch it , jokes never get old or warned out some not fond of british humor (which is an outright nonsense insanity rollercoaster) if you are prepare for 90 minute to two hours you'll sit through every cast member monty python in top form
if you love oddly hilarious movies have to see this one ! i laughed all the way through movie and it is funny that other day saw a t-shirt with of my favorite scenes had get black knight his legs cut off him saying come back here i'll bite your
a classic . the funniest movie ever with black knight , killer rabbit and holy hand grenade this is best part has to be french guy i fart in your general direction my favorite at least think so !
best war movie ever!! !
i am a magician , but there are some who call me.....tim ? whenever play d+d i'm always tim the .
a timeless classic . this movie is so absurd that it's hilarious not very many movies are capable of type comedy
this movie is so goofy it's hilarious . you almost have to watch it a couple of times catch everything and helps read the script their humor off-the-wall that be in right mood , but overall great when need good belly laugh
wow -- this is the best movie ever ! so easy to follow , hilarious . my favorite two scenes (very hard pick) would have be burn witch very useful information on how tell whether or not someone a next bring out your dead pick up people almost dead.. just great all together i love it if you haven't seen at least rent but reccomend buying whenever need good laugh and watch its awesome don't like movies that no point then might appreciate as much
one of stanley kubrick's best films
what a hilarious movie . the holy hand grenade and bridge keeper (what is average speed of sparrow?) are just few many funny things in this flick
i've never been a big fan of british humore but when this comedy troupe got together for first python installment , it was sheer magic not too mention attack the funny bone . i still laugh today at movie
this movie never gets old to me ! some many great characters and scenes
it is very popular in my family , because of its weird humor .
before i thought this movie was horrible . then watched it again , time more closely has to be the best almost ever is very historically accurate and awesome jokes that make funny
this movie is hilarious . i watched it in my 9th grade history class when learning about the middle ages and definitely does have educational value uses satire regarding life medieval europe seen especially brilliant writers of mocked constant warfare guy had both his arms legs cut off still continued to make an attempt at fighting a great piece political commentary
one of the funniest movies ever ! aside from a couple bad words and risque moments , its good movie for entire family . jokes puns slapstick never stop providing gallons laughs highly recommended
if you don't like this film i shall fart in your general direction ! now go away or taunt a second time!
omg! ! what can you say about this movie ? it is just way too funny everytime i see crack up . monty python soo hilarious would be very hard in my opinion for anyone to top when comes being :)
this movie is hillarious . i really like the scenes with french guys if you've got any sense of humor , you'll
what else has to be said except that its the greatest comedy movie ever made!! ! i can watch holy grail 50 million times and still laughing as hard first time watching it .
to get technical , this is an absurdist movie . if you've never seen it i can happily recommend not because essential viewing by some pretentious gen-x standard but simply one of the funniest movies that has ever been made do yourself a favor and watch go on you deserve
zany british humor cannot be done better than by the monty python troop . my father made me watch this when i was young , and ever since then have been hooked on their hilarity is of a most unique brand movie stands out as probably being widely accepted film american audiences there absolutely no character development for good reason wit outstandingly brilliant filled with some best brainless comedy around audio work are below average due in part to film's budget its foreign highly recommended now something completely different
loved it at the time and have seen many times since(harrison ford is a legend,mainly due to star wars .
the knights who say nee.. .
one of my favorite movies . it's sooo silly , but at the same time very intelligent monty python boys really knew their stuff when they recreated medieval i like peasants talking about government ( you're not king didn't vote for you ) is those things or hate hard to be neutral it
merely a flesh wound .
what an utterly stupid movie . i'll be kind and give it the proper rating deserves (5 stars) is funny.. .... http://www.flingthecow.com/ hope this helps -----
simply the very best not only in british humor - which i admit to being happily biased toward but period . if you can't laugh at these guys , probably anything watch it every chance get especially when want escape gray doldrums of winter
you really cannot beat the monty python lot , holy grail is one of my favourite films . especially with knights who say 'nee' and demand a shrubbery (then changed it to eckky zuboing....) also french saying 'your mother was pig your father smelled elderberries' its fantastic film full dry wit us british are proud have
i am brave sir...shut up ! a classic funny . was laughing straight for days and reciting passages it took me while to get what the knights of ni had changed their name , but got ekkiekkiekkibekongzooopboing
one of the best comedies all time
what an utterly stupid movie this is ! and i mean that as a compliment five englishmen one american (john cleese , eric idle michael palin graham chapman terry jones gilliam) calling themselves monty python's flying circus  after name they pulled from the london phone directory gained international fame through television show did in early seventies for british broadcasting company england . shows became phenom states largely public stations troupe film based on reworkings of their sketches called now something completely different which was not released u.s until later python holy grail (1974) first comprised original material cementing reputation deservedly so script irreverent very silly reworking king arthur legends work all pythons it directed by gilliam who also animation he had humor absurd extreme recruiting knights his court at camelot (a musical place where armoured dance tables kicking off plates cups) has gathered few more famous names sky opens cartoon god looking stern charges to seek when responds good idea oh lord deity rolls it's eyes thunders course begin adventures small band knights.and are everything large wooden trojan rabbit build infiltrate castle (unfortunately forget climb inside) encounter with mysterious shrubbery-loving say 'nee' mere repetition syllable nee can cause pain or worse then too there fluffy little white guards cave kyre bannor can...well you wouldn't believe if told you'll have check out yourself sounds wall here let me assure even opening credits (read them carefully they're part fun!) end contemporary (for 1974 anyhow)english policeman puts hand over camera lens says : that's enough son (i'm kidding!) pure craziness roles played except minor women's parts tour de force unlike anything else will ever see might be only attempt answer question flight velocity laden swallow ?
one of the best thrillers last 20 years and way better than tv show . full iconic scenes esp dam
monthy pyton takes the price ! is there any better comedians than them ? hey watch out for killer rabbit!! =)
statement:monty python's the holy grail is not funniest movie of all time . reply:yes it
you either love it or hate . depends on your sense of humour if have my dry british , then is the best i think they should get back together ps (beware killer bunny)
not as funny life of brian , but still hysterical .
this is the funniest movie i have ever seen . it pure genius british comedy at its best , filled with complete absurdity and mayhem
british humor is so much funnier than our american brand . they're out there- take huge risks and either you get it or don't good
a true classic in british humor . i've watched it 5-6 times it's just as funny every time has witty (and not so witty) with great cast setting for comedy
monty python movies always have me rollin' on the floor .
a wonderful adaptation of age-old myth and legend . the holy grail manages to turn even treasured antiquity into comic genius situations imminent peril become running gags , witty dialogue makes nonsense seem important
funny . very genuinely british humor without being insufferable no apologies made , prisoners taken the quotable movie of all time
this movie is an absolute calssic-anyone who doesn't find hilarious not part of the human race .
neep
what a funny movie . an absolute classic with so many memorable lines and scenes it's just flesh wound
there should be a fantastic button to rate this movie . if you didn't like the holy grail then don't laugh
i will watch this whenever it comes on ( cable only !) . could probably find something funny i've missed in the past.it would be interesting to tally up "all" of things movie a classic that never die
classic .
just plain funny . beaver cleaver's mother talking jive really tickles the funnybone !
fast paced thriller . did great justice to the old tv show
simply funny !! ! one of my best classic comedy movies
stupid , but that't the point . one of funniest movies ever made amazing how 25 years later person quoting line will start a flurry quotes much like caddyshack or blues brothers in that sense be careful what you quote and where it have seen grown man naked ? can get trouble
i don't know what it is about airplane , but could watch 20x and still laugh hysterically . why can't they make stupidly hysterical movies like this anymore ? as much try just never quite it.99% of the time it's plain stupid
one of the funniest movies i have ever seen . like part when people on island are dunking
incredibly funny movie , with a spectrum of humor from lowbrow slapstick to witty parody . the i speak jive like my coffee black men kareem abdul jabbar and crazy dude in control tower are just few many gems priceless comedy for continuous laughs movies trump airplane
definatly one of the best comedies around . it's got loads creatvie gags on jaws , saturday night fever casablanca and much more it also has colorful characters great liners don't forget non-stop slapstick is really possible to hate this ?
raiders had a real life hero , time and place settings threw in little bit of otherwordly magic actually made it all seem possible . plus there were unforgettable one liners
great movie . really suspensing and a classic
one of the funniest movies all times . king arthur vs black knight is classic example a lopsided battle !
this is leslie neilsen's best movie . i love the auto pilot scenes sequel a complete disappointment though
really great comedy . leslie neilsen was excellent
a truly crazy movie that had me both going what!? ! and laughing at the same time . way they played with words was best , i never get tired of this one
i've seen this movie at least six times over the years , and it *still* makes me laugh every time . there aren't many jokes that misfire even things could seem like outdated humor such as those about kareem abdul-jabaar's pilot character roger (i think you're greatest but my dad says you don't play hard enough) are still very funny because of ludicrous situation setup remain timeless
funniest movie ever made . leslie nielsen rules the zucker brothers rule they created this silly and irrelevant masterpiece impossible not to laugh unless you are a corpse
wonderfully original (for its time) classic . created the mold for future comedies
this movie is so funny . lloyd bridges also played a great part and before the ended , he was chain smoking alcoholic drug addict
released in 1980 , airplane ! is the classic zucker-abrahams-zucker parody of disaster movies that were all rage during 1970's (eg towering inferno poseidon adventure and obviously crash movies) . our hero ex-military pilot ted striker (robert hays) who now afraid flying ; however he chases down his estranged girlfriend a stewardess elaine dickinson (julie hagerty) flight food poisoning knocks out crew many passengers forcing to fly land plane helping are glue-sniffing controller mccroskey (lloyd bridges) old military captain rex kramer stack) dr rumack (leslie nielsen) just happens be on board did not eat fish with this structure film goes through constant puns slapstick outrageous dialogue along lines naked gun as heroes must deal an uncooperative autopilot screaming singing nun religious zealots other stereotypes from genre catch gags multiple viewings necessary usually there something going background often missed first go-round bottom line for good or ill started type over top reason (if no other) movie landmark release you've got clearance clarence roger what's vector victor ?
i rember the series from 60s and was so glad this film didn't disappoint . keeps urgency going throughout
this movie was on tv a few weeks ago so its humor is fresh in my mind . try watching it with out laughing i bet thats impossible
one of the greatest comedy movies all-time . director to this movie did and put all his effort into , i love it! !
much better than the diaster movies it parodies . one would think after terrrorist attacks on 9-11 , this movie not seem as funny but somehow survives with its humour intact very and well worth watching when is often repeated tv
still the best ever spoof sending up not just all those dire 1970s disaster movies but also 'saturday night fever & old bogie films . funniest scene is one with blonde stewardess singing guitar to ill kid
five stars ? surely you can't be serious . i am and stop calling me shirley one of those movies that's so painful , it's good
i was smoking some bud about two weeks ago and laughed like never before . this is the comedy movie for people who want to get high or drunk view cinematic absurdity
there's a sale at penneys !!! !
liked it . and the characters were good ford jones superb a film u should watch
satire at it's best .
a hilarious comedy ! one that i had to buy watch over and funny catch lines you find yourself quoting like the tower rapuzel rapunzel! black guys jive talking mrs . cleaver , haha!
funny movie . that's all you need to know
this is one of the greatest movies all time ! it's kind movie that you have to watch more than once , because won't catch jokes first see it . there's never a dull moment and i still use line am serious don't call me shirley
one of the best movies . those kinds where you have to watch a few times pick up on all subtle jokes they throw at
midgets will always be funny . farts airplane ! have you ever seen a grown man naked ?
screamingly funny . and leave a note for the milkman - no more cheese !
harrison ford is awsome very good movie
brings me off the couch laughing . i just hate leslie neilson because his opening is always same
this is so funny i cant stand iyt
hilarious !
ahhh , a real classic of it's kind!! ! always gag waiting in the wings .
it's great for when you want comedy don't have to think about . i must seen it 50 times , and every single time find myself absolutely laughing out of my chair not mention still pick up on jokes hadn't before anything with leslie nielson in is pure gold
this movie runs at five gags a second . aside from one or two distasteful , the is great full of puns jokes and visual even more amusing barbara billingsley's cameo as jive-spearker oh remember they're running on instruments (music plays) :)
comedy style similar to naked gun , so if you like one should watch the other . features a very fast paced approach jokes viewer needs pay attention i've seen it at least 15 times and i still pick up on something new each time there is always some kind of humor taking place in background it's more than just lines make movie funny
never can get enough of thise one
this is definately one of the best movies all time
one of my favorite movies . it's so darn funny !
airplane is one movie you don't want to miss . it so funny and fast-paced , that have call a classic ted striker elaine dickenson are 2 former sweethearst end up on the same plane full of group eccentric characters including : singing nun heart-transplant patient gay arabian men an inflatable pilot doctor who doesn't be called surely
shurley there were a lot of movies about plane truobles at the time , i was told by my mom . so some crzy guy said f!% that lets make movie people will laugh and not worry crashin made this it first to ever really put slapstick-non-stop comedy into more 50 times thats why is great up tight wont like but sure as heck did any person should too came out in 1977 born '85 never gets old even dad cant stop watching it!!!! ! oh yea dont call me shurley!!
a movie chock full of great lines ; i laughed when those were quoted within other comments here . was disappointed in the dvd though they could have been more candid and better prepared for director's commentary audio track perhaps someone can use it to make hat , broach or pteridactal
funny , ! i love this classic movie . puns here there everywhere everything is taken to the extreme- and beyond
this movie is , to my knowledge the first prioritize jokes and gags over storyline . unlike mel brooks movies it's easy miss most of time through- i highly recommend repeat viewing backdrop for film an airplane that needs be landed a former pilot trying find confidence save day stays funny all way through though loved it !
who can forget lines like , jim never vomits at home and scenes the tupperware party that focuses on upcoming monsoon season ? it's so easy to quote this movie . i still laugh outloud every time see it
classically hilarious movie . i loved it even as a kid , before got all the jokes and only gets funnier now !
with jokes flying a mile minute , airplane is an absolutely hilarious movie . the ridiculous often bizarre humor can catch you off-guard which makes even funnier i start laughing just thinking about barbara billingsley (june cleaver) talking jive or woman who wonders why her husband having second cup of coffee he never does at home (a spoof on old commercial) because this jam-packed clever word play recommend seeing it several times in order to absorb everything
alot better than u.s . marshalls
best movie for great laughs .
i like the play on words in this movie .
a classic 80's movie with really funny story . matthew brodrick is great
i love this movie , and it inspired me to do something creative/crazy anytime cut school .
i love this movie ! one of the greatest 80s movies made . practically know every line.. was only 10 yrs old when released , and remember thinking it would be cool to like ferris got into high school
this movie is amazing . its every teens dream to be like ferris he just so funny , and cool an all around great
ferris buller is about a teen skipping school with his friend and girlfriend . this great comedy movie matthew brodrick hillarous in very funny
that movie was very good thats what inspired me and my friend to ditch
released in 1986 , ferris bueller's day off is one of those john hughes' films that now part the common american experience especially for who grew up big 80's . local legend bueller (matthew broderick) hippest guy high school and decides it would be a shame to waste perfect class ; therefore he calls sick drags his friend cameron frye (alan ruck) actually under weather girlfriend sloane peterson (mia sara) along ride however principal ed rooney (jeffrey jones) secretary (edie mcclurg) are not fooled long during much needed vacation trio take classic ferrari owned by cameron's dad hit tourist spots chicago crash parade while pontificates on philosophies life nevertheless out spoil party make repeat senior year supporting core cast jennifer grey as ferris' straight-laced sister jeanie hopes gets caught cindy pickett lyman ward parents short appearance charlie sheen ben stein teachers this film have reached cult status without performance broderick philosophical asides then contemporary teenaged themes everyone wanted like knew someone him (in fact my still me ferris) an underdog fighting system bottom line movie has become lexicon (note alan ruck was 30 years old when played cameron.)
this movie legitimized the term 'mental health day,' proving that every one needs to play hookey now and then . for , i am grateful
one of the great movies eighties , up there with risky business and breakfast club .
the only funny matthew broderick movie i've ever seen .
if only i were as lucky mr . bueller when it came to skipping class :( this movie is cute and funny good for a laugh i'd recommend anyone !
school has always tryed to seize the freedom of kids . great thing about ferris is that he doesn't care at all what those damn grown ups think every oppurtunity not acted upon an lost forever so go ahead say whatever it you feel like saying and do doing this only life you've got nuts !
the smart humor combines with crazy antics of ferris bueller will leave you laughing in your sleep . this is kind movie always remember watching and want to watch it again i don't think came across one person who said they didn't find at least amusing makes cut school take best friend's dad's car out sing a parade
go soak your head !
this movie is already a classic and for good reason . probably matthew broderick's 2nd best film , wargames being his the whole just made you laugh feel it rare to see gem of such as one nowadays i own on dvd never tire charlie sheen also makes an appearance in back those days he was so attractive actually entertaining......that alone worth watching highly recommend everyone
i still love this movie , and i've seen it probably close to 100 times . a lot of the reason like so much is nostalgia i'm sure
definitely my favorite movie of all time . matthew broderick reminds me childhood (though his measly 9 absences pales in comparison to me) as he skips school and takes a day on the town with girlfriend best friend
matthew broderick and his undeniable ubiquitous charm made this movie so great . in the scenes where he looks directly into camera starts talking it is though we are part of , that's one reasons still holds up today
love it . while is funny , spunky and entertaining shows a truly marvelous character change in cameron modern classic
by far one of the best movies made from a tv show . movie is powerful , riveting and great action adventure film harrison ford terrific as dr richard kimble man accussed murdering his wife tommy lee jones was perfect sam gerard u.s marshall who took job seriously put out all stops to find hooks you beginning doesn't let go
one of the funniest movies ever .
rooney? ! this is ed peterson
fuuuuunnnnyyyy , ffffuuuuunnnnnnyyyyy,fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy . it really was funny
who doesn't love this movie ? everybody wants to be ferris .
how could anyone not love this movie ?
a movie that you can watch over and again never get bored . just can't help but be drawn in by ferris's unique charm he's the guy we all want to i thought matthew broderick played role perfectly , what hilarious performance jeffrey jones watching this if ever see it on when i'm browsing channels i'll despite countless times i've seen before movie's blatant sarcasm is like best about
cult classic or great comedy . so many points and lines in this movie
harrason ford played it great even when he was sick during the "suppose" fight sence with sword guy just didn't feel well that so improvised . i would have done same thing
lots of fun watching this movie . great dialogue and action the special effects were also very good
hilarious . ed rooney making an idiot out of himself was extremely funny.hhhhheeeeeyyyyy !!!! !
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen its great it about 65 times and never get tired .
this was a great movie , really must see if you haven't already .
loved it ! i watch probably a couple times year .
i have seen this film a million times , amazing how still get laugh out of it every time . broadrick was excellent in and the way over all plot came together simply perfect my favorite scene is when cameron calls principal pretending to be slone's father tells him off thinking ferris buler on other line watch fur fly !
ferris bueller is one of the best movies i have ever seen . it a bona fide american classic amazingly , that way all teenagers feel : how can get out going to school today ? indescribable funny when ben stein playing teacher standing in front class repeating his monotonous voice another great part movie principal thinks calling and insults person on other line tries mellow uptight friend cameron bulk day off seeing father getting into taxi cubs game singing twist shout with john lennon middle parade float hurrying home time so no would find he was feigning illness rings doorbell has recording you go nuts laughing really wonderful
great movie and a lot of spice added with matthew broderick .
very funny
i only wish ferris were my friend .
another great job by harrison ford as dr . richard kimble the way he finally figures out who really killed his wife , while all avoiding sheriff tommy lee jones makes whole movie
this movie has been on my a list for years . the plot is hilarious , and being one of matthew broderick's earlier works he able to pull off boyish version cool that not well duplicated since jeffery jones plays unfortunate principal supported unrealistic happenings are balanced by inevitable consequences which happen screen eventually characters begin grow up i laughed good deal
this movie is one of my favorites . ferris plans everything perfectly with just enough careless fun to pull off the perfect day great
if i see this show is on as idly surf by usually find myself settling in and continuing to watch it regardless of the countless times i've seen before . ferris everybody's hero ; cool without being too into himself , funny he never gets caught
this movie was da bomb . i have never laughed so hard before thanks for an awesome matthew!! !
this is one of my favorite movies . it has comedy , teen rebellion a nice car and an ideal day the actors are perfect for their roles pull them off flawlessly
this is a classic 80's movie . it never gets old for me , it's as funny today was then
this is a hilarious movie and classic . i personally have see it over 20 times so funny matthew broderick great in would not been as without him love because shows that some people can actually get out of going to school while the rest us are smart
this is a classic movie and who doesn't want to live on the wild side by cutting school ?
this is my favorite comedy , and possibly movie of all time . there are great lines hilarious scenes after graduating from high school i really identified with ferris his day-off  !
a cult fave , ferris.. . is funny as hell and full of great banter root against the pigs ! relive high school compare contrast with broderick in election  must see- twist shout anyone ?
such an excellent movie . i believe saw it the summer turned 13 in theater and love as much now ferris was guy everyone wanted to be around like his blissful day of playing hooky with best friend girlfriend is everyone's dream , no matter what your age bueller..bueller..bueller.
it seems like this movie is on tnt or tbs usa every week , but i catch myself watching each time . very funny and matthew broderick at his best whatever happened to hot girlfriend ? don't remember seeing her in anything else which truly unfortunate there also a collection of actors the film who would go bigger things (charlie sheen jennifer grey ben stein alan ruck-stuart spin city) be surprised if anyone hasn't actually seen you haven't should your next rental/purchase choice
i enjoyed how matthew broderick was just a student cutting class but it made so the audience cheered for him . he broke rules everyone still loved humor of that movie also very funny
everyone agrees this movie is a classic . the comic genius undeniable alone or with large group hilarious and entertaining wants to be have friend like ferris bueller
was a classic the moment it released .
ferris bueller's day off is one of the besy movies about living life to its fullest .
ferris bueller's day off is the type of comedy that you just want to see again and .
a great classic commedy ! i never get sick of it...but it is better un-editted , the tv version isn't as good .
feris buellers day off is a classic , the acting scenery plot cinematography .
one of those movies which you could watch over and again.. .
you`ve gone too far , you'll get caught first of all you can never go and second if i'm gonna it isn't be by that guy .
as a result of this movie , i spent one glorious summer before my senior year in high school slacking off many ferris-like ways . unlike less intelligent friend quit job could be fired !
this is the all time best movie
best movie ever .
ferris bueler's day off remains in my top 10 movie picks of all time ! it's been on the list since first i saw it!
this movie ultimately resulted in me getting fired from my summer job high school . like ferris , i began doing fun and interesting things instead of wasting time a place didn't want to be went canoeing golfing took roadtrips unlike was held accountable for actions
using the original sets from classic universal frankenstein movies , gene wilder as frederick ("that's fronkensteen.") creates his monster with aid of sexy blonde lab assistant inga (teri garr) and bumbling bug-eyed hunchback igor (marty feldman.) mel brooks' was huge in year 1974 he released two most noted films 'young frankenstein' 'balzing saddles' to delight comedy fans everywhere . here parodies 'frankenstein' 'the bride 'son house a few musical numbers thrown for good measure madeline kahn kenneth mars hackman provide series hilarious send-ups elizabeth (frederick's fiance) police inspector kemp blind man while peter boyle uses grunts growls facial expressions breathe life into portrayal "the monster." is usual sometimes calm exasperated self attempts interact this group crazies use genius carry on famous relative's work cloris leachman laugh riot former girlfriend senior current housekeeper castle one best comedies all time well worthy it's lofty rating among entries do yourself favor see view film you might pick up copy 'blazing make it double-feature
this is one fantastic movie . harrison ford the likable doctor who you of course want to believe tommy lee jones 'bad guy' u.s marshall actually just doing his job plot rocks , action taut acting perfect also those 'rated' movies kids could watc it has no sexual content mild violence and a medium amount language go rent tonight
one of many masterpieces by mel brooks .
wears well and is still funny .
don't .  .put .the candle .back still one of the funnies movies i've ever seen
help me with the bags ? you take blond i'ill one in turbin . a classic line from great movie , gene wilder mary feldman terri garr madeline kahn and peter boyle all at mercy of mel brooks how could this not be funny
the first movie i have a memory of seeing in theater , which might well explain lot . it never really got cult status other movies but is fond mine and still funny today
classic comedy that never grows old . i love this movie ! great cast
there are no words .
amongst comedy movies , this is the equivalent of godfather . mel brooks' greatest movie by far i must have seen it at least a dozen times and still convulse when hear horse neigh winny whenever name blucher said it's in my top-5 with animal house caddyshack airplane holy grail (amazing that all are 25 years or older)
one of the greastest comedy movies our day .
i think the fugitive is a great movie . don't like tv shows though
simply stated in black & white , a brilliant comedy must see !
very funny movie . i saw this as a teenager must admit went reluctantly because friend wanted to see the and be polite was so glad all actors are great in their roles gene wilder , marty feldman peter boyle terri garr cloris leachman great. ! nd is madeleline kahn one of my favorite scenes after young frankenstein created new he escapes ends up at blind man's house {well played by hackman}.alot other too for good laugh would reccomend
this movie was great i like how even though they had movies in color then it's black and white cause it gives the old monster feel . also a very funny , dance scene wife of guy falls love with frankenstein igor's eyes are so ! is comedy classic good indeed
gene wilder as dr . frankenstien is almost perfect casting marty feldman did a terrific job igor cloris leachman wonderful the maidservant frau buchler (did i just hear horse whinney??) this movie was funny when it first released , and has aged well there are literally hundreds of tiny jokes you miss time watch but catch with each successive showing defintly five stars!!!! !
mel brooks is a genius . so gene wilder and terri garr just fun to look at (we won't mention feldman.) anyway , i can't think of another black-and-white monster movie that's made me laugh more often than this one *wolf howls* inga : werewolf ! dr frankenstein ? igor *points* there wolf castle why are you talking like that thought wanted no *shrug* suit yourself i'm easy
a brilliant parody of the early movies , this is brooks at his best .
this is absolutely one of the all-time classic comedies . true brilliance it best to watch with a group friends who can quote all good lines !
quite possibly the best and funniest mel brooks movie .
we already knew the plot before ever watched this movie , so what they did was to make part of lawman more important and play up interaction between harrison ford tommy lee jones . casting in is great could not have chosen a better us marshal than big dog he fair relentless little by becomes sympathetic but still manage few surprises along way
mel brooks and gene wilder's best . put the candle back
this is one very funny movie and the cast truly inspired . they really seem to be having as much fun audience make it a memorable characters like frankenstein , igor frau bleucher monster are riot madeline khan terri garr wonderful well
if there is such a thing as the perfect cast with script director and in perfectly memorable delight of comedy , this it . almost 30 years from its release people can quote line for gem - still laugh now that's what i call masterpiece frau blucher ! .... neigh...
one of the best comedies ever made . i have seen it about 40 times and still laugh at gene wilder's dr frankenstein is hilarious as a straight man in world comics marty feldman shines eye-gor (hump ? what hump?) peter boyle expresses so much while barely having any lines but hackman's blind cleric steals all , does madeleine kahn's virginal fiance must see for anyone you'll yourself silly
this is a great humor and one of the best movies i ever saw .
all-star cast , hilarious parody . full of memorable scenes and on-going jokes that somehow don't get old-- whenever someone utters frau brugher (sp?).. gene wilder gets to do plenty yelling acting insane which is what he does best when you're in the right mood this a movie
mel brooks is a genius ! this has to be one of the funniest movies i have ever seen excellent comedy
this may be my favorite mel brooks movie . i love the whole classic horror feel that we get from it being filmed in black and white also enjoy seeing marty feldman one of his best performances sight gags abound , sceen where doctor brings monster to life they used many electrical props original frankenstein features a great cast is worth buying for your home collection
young frankenstein is an extremly funny movie that stars gene wilder as dr . who creates yet another monster , and has this hunchback named igor working for him the wants to be loved when they create bride she some good-hot lovin  doesn't like her so he runs away goes shack where blind guy making espresso but it again finds doctor eating lots of kippers likes them
classically grand . few comedies can touch this film ....
this is a great movie ! mel brooks genious it one of the best movies all time .
young frankenstein a must see down right funny.madeline khan wonderful , and gene wilder you can still his pretty blue eyes in black white . classic
with apologies to blazing saddles , this is the very best of mel brooks movies . madeline kahn marty feldman are triumphant
one of the funniest movies out there . check frankenstein monster and gene wilder puttin on ritz marty feldman is great , too
this is a great movie . harrison ford actor and does job the plot action scenes are very fast paced
this is a super movie , with two stars ; tommy lee jones and harrison ford . the team tie up to make great suspensful sequel us marshalls are definite must sees
the other mel brooks classic (along with 'young frankenstein') from 1974 . in this one , he spoofs jimmy stewart marlena deitrich western "destry rides again" (1939) among others while employing liberal uses of known cliches situational gags and archetypal characterizations co-written by richard pryor (among others) starring cleavon little as "sheriff bart" gene wilder "the waco kid" madeline kahn "lili von shtupp" harvey korman "hedy ("that's hedley!") lamarr." comedy hijinks abound bart his pal try to rally citizens rockridge into putting aside their prejudice's order save town governor (played brooks) hired henchmen (led veteran character actor slim pickens taggert.) a romp beginning end worthy many repeated viewings what year we had at movies back 74 ! my sides are still aching
i regard this film and monty python's holy grail as the two funniest films ever . satire of westerns is one three absolute must see mel brooks , other are young frankenstein producers
another brooks masterpiece .
i love the scene where they bait klan guys with white women at ? line . also like badges we don't need no stinking ! update : before irish calls it i'll admit was a rip off
mel brooks' funniest film ! gene wilder and madeline kahn , thats really all you have to say as they are hillarious in this western that takes a poke at racisim . clevon little is great the villians
the farting by campfire scene alone is worth 3 stars . and don't tell me you didn't laugh , cause i know did a classic that movies still steal from today
mt vote for the funniest moveie of all time .
one of the most compelling action movies i've ever seen . will definitely always be my favorites
hilarious ! mel brooks is a genius .
absolutely brilliant satire of westerns and racism .
mel brooks at his best .
hey ! where are all the white women at ?
one of the most funniest films made in awhile !
one of the best brooks comedies . a little politically incorrect for today's standards , i guess but still gut-busting
what can i say.....ford and jones are hot triple !
hilarious . one of the best jokes is how many people think badges ? we don't need no stinkin' comes from this movie for hoi-polloi , line treasure sierra madre
candygram for mongo
a great movie . even with the racism and vulgarity , but i think that's what makes it funny this is best mel brooks ever check out if you already haven't
a movie that probably could not be made today , this is arguably one of the finest pieces american cinema . i don't feel i'm exagerrating from subtle lines to most offensive gags ( more beans mr taggart ? ) blazing saddles never tries anything it's and comes out being so much ; real reflection amercan society humor in mid 20th century recently watched film with some college-aged people (18-22) sadly having grown up political correctness sound bites slapstick-only really genius moments were lost them examples sherrif's n-(church bell) ...my mother dutch ! even twoo these poor kids just didn't get it needless say fart scene was big hit if your life experiences have taken you beyond television watch but that's case chances are already
this is the funniest movie ever ! mel brooks king of comedy and proves it with film . oh callmetootie , i think he was more focused on making funny than fun westerns
mel's best ? perhaps . i didn't realize just how great of a movie this was until watched it recently so many classic scenes and characters- hedley lemarr , mongol ( only pawn in game life ) et all the film has good way mocking racism 17 is my limit on schnitzengruben
undeniably the funniest most brilliantly made comedy  , and no not just spoof i said best ever . even though with its racist humor extremely offensive dialogue everyone can find room to laugh at this one
my god , this was one of the funniest movies all time . where is your head at 'callmetootie' ?
one of the most exploitive movies ever made . but , comon' you can't tell me didn't laugh when mongo knocked hell out that horse we don't need no stinkin' badges priceless !
one of the great movies all time . mel is king
one the best parodies i have ever had joy of watching - several dozen times ! so many hilarious and memorable lines just thinking about them cracks me up . entire cast is excellent but clevon little , gene wilder madeline kahn are priceless there too great parts in this movie to actually say a favorite start laughing at get no kick from champagne don't stop until drive off into sunset some greatest comic therapy available
a laugh minute . when clevon little starts singing i get kick out of you can't stop laughing the whole movie is riot where are all white women at ?
by far the funniest movie of all time . something funny was said or happened every minute to see count basie in middle prarie 1874 a riot
this movie is very thrilling ! it keeps you in suspense throughout highly recommended , especially for people who love the original series .
mel brooks is a comic genius . blazing saddles always makes me smile cheese
in the beginning of comedy , there was mel brooks .
mel brooks at his finest .
i guess the aunt edna croaking scene makes movie .
ohhh clark , this tent smells........edna is your
a classic!! ! chevy chase punching that talking clown head was just hysterical
chevy chase at his best . great to see imogene coca too
i need to get hold of a knitting pattern that he had on with reindeer in his christmas film anyone know where can obtain one please
national lampoon's vacation is a true comedy . i laughed all the way thru it...never dull moment chevy chase was hilarious , but star of this movie obviously beverly d'angelo an underrated actress who always does superb job in any role she takes on makes you feel like are actually from real world for hour and half ride isn't bad great that already classic...highly recommended....update- would have to agree with goneaway somewhat felt vacations been just well not identical definately had some really over years..
hillarious !
two words.. . very funny !
this is one movie that i can watch over and again it never gets old . chevy chase think absolutely hilarious despite people nowadays giving him a hard time loved , european vacation christmas vegas vaction wasn't all was mainly because didn't care for who they picked their kids another great if you love movies funny farm! ! have to say national lampoon's has be of the funniest from 80's classic!!
although i don't like chevy chase , this was one of his better films . love the part where they go to their white trash in-laws house for a stop-over and have drag old aunt along with her cujo-like dog fantastic
very funny . one of few comedies that i can watch over and again
this is one of the most perfect comedies ever made . chevy chase great and his best it hilarious from start to finish
fugitive was a good movie with plot . great acting job by the cast had nice getaways and action
this a great series of movies . if you want to see funny movie , one
these movies are nothing less than amazing . i can't explain humor that profound don't rent them though , just flip to one of those t stations (ex : tnt) on a sunday afternoon
national lampoon's vacation is by far the best movie of 1983 , and one comedies ever made in history filmmaking . chevy chase beverly d angelo anthony michael hall dana barron star as griswolds who are on their way to a famous amusement park wallyworld
chevy chase's career is justified by this one film , even if he's made a bunch more that tarnish our memory of him . and aunt edna christie brinkley play their parts perfectly as well !
a classic . man , i still remember the first time saw christie brinkly drive up in that ferrari this movie has bunch of hilarious scenes - my favorite being talk chevy chase with anthony michael hall after he runs car off road what happened to ? fletch his saturday night live days did some great stuff then it just started getting worse and culminating disastrous show if you only know from more recent movies definitely rent vacation so can see him golden
the movie kept me interested . i was anxious to see what going happen next loved mystery involved harrison ford is a good actor
all the chevy chase national lampoon movies are really funny .
national lampoon movies are really great . this 1st movie about the griswald family vacation was so hilarious .. not as good mational lampoon's european though
a must see .
does it have flaws ? yes ! bring back memories of the good old days did establish a genre (for better or for worse?)
take into consideration the fact that they had a group of people who were largely inexperienced , very little money and no history this kind movie to help carry it it's much more impressive how good funny is . everything from porkys fast times at ridgemont high american pie can draw line their success animal house over ? was when germans bombed pearl harbor
who sent the cadavers to alumni dinner
they can't do that to our pleges - only we can ! so un-pc and funny it wouldn't get filmed today .
planes trains & automobiles beats out animal house?? ? oh i don't think so ! this movie put national lampoon on the map . a timeless classic
i was like 10 years old and my uncle took me to go see it . he used always drag along with him his friends great after seeing the movie hilarious a 10yr  thought big shot at school next day telling every one got belushi mash potatoes classic makes you miss even more realize what talent world lost
the king of comedies . my #2 favorite movie all time (next to rocky) though primarily lowbrow , anyone who went college can relate this (i was not a greek either) if i had rank scenes it would go : #1 mind we dance with yo dates ; marmarlade -- raped in prison niedermeyer shot by his own troops vietnam #3 bluto's inspirational speech deltas (was over when germans bombed pearl harbor) #4 double secret probation #5 i'm zit #6 bluto smashing guitar #7 devil/angel scene #8 parade #9 reaction they see dorfman for first #10 expulsion dean wormer watch animal house and still laugh at same freakin' actually an incident similar fawn leibowitz pity young dude is quite prolific rater here gave 1 star say you that need start drinking heavily
it's a shame comedies like this are so rarely made anymore - clever , warm-hearted and funny throughout . i still think over ? was it when the germans bombed pearl harbor hell no ! is one of funniest lines in cinema delivered as by guy who really should not have been college to start with
i love this movie ! has to be seen uncut the networks butcher it . truly one of funniest films ever made with a great cast
i have the double secret probation edition on dvd . brilliant movie and some cool extras
a must own classic that i never get tired of . the devil and angel on fighting over whether or not he should have sex with girl is absolutely hilarious crude humor at it's best
the only national lampoon movie worth watching . hilarious reminds me of college
if you don't like this movie , what's stuck up your a** . john belushi at his best
the all time greatest movie . great acting and heart beating action smart
the greatest movie of all time . period
if you don't like base humour - then this isn't for . the first time i saw film was in absolute stitches and it never fails to crack my up know what college scene is america , but its i'd love go over have a peek favouritw has be when bluto cafeteria piling food onto his tray he actually stuffs whole hamburger into mouth ! sits down girl says that boy p.i.g response put some white ice cream guess am now hits cheeks so sprays out of zit proceeds start fight an absolutely fantastic which definately cult classic (it also kevin bacon starred in)
animal house is one of the funniest films i have ever seen . poeple will be enjoying this movie for years to come could never grow bored seeing it think that any with great john belushi in long remembered
among the big screen comedies that starred first-generation snl regulars , this one takes prize . (and in my opinion only caddyshack comes close.) characters are unforgettable plot and writing excellect even random details of movie have to be considered classic (ie bluto's shirt just says college)
i love this movie . there are few more satisfying plots than that of a wrongfully accused person who is vindicated and earns the respect hard-nosed cop trying to chase him down performances were all great , dialogue possessed gritty real-life quality found refreshing one minor irritant : it course absurd ford would wait until after being convicted track one-arm man via his mechanical arm not he had bother revealed chicago pd interviewed murderer during their initial investigation they have do show picture identified (the craggy-faced only disguised himself with wig for heaven's sake) (i also wonder how got 13 people verify was out town when wasn't but no matter.) since lack forced entry into apartment big issue first question someone asked if somebody might key bingo -- dr nichols borrowed car even phoned from oh well been so logical we wouldn't gripping highly entertaining far bigger
the funniest movie ever ! you will still be laughing days after seeing it
animal house is one of the greatest comedy movies all time and doesn't change that . if you've never seen it , where have you been see again say lines as they them bluto otter's final speech to get deltas fired up do some damage still my favorite scene in movie so different funny
the greatest representation of college life ever to hit screen .
best comedy of all time . a must see for anyone who plans to go college , is in or was
the best movie of all times ! enter any male college students' room/house and you will find a jonh belushi poster hanging on wall . it's to get pumped up ready party
animal house is one of the funniest movies ever made . it should be model used by all modern directors for comedies
animal house is the pioneer of classic comedy movies , john belushi was one best pure comedians even though he a drug addict
the greatest of all comedies . i must have seen this one 20 times , and it still cracks me up every is a classic belushi at his best
a must-see for every beer-swilling , die-hard frat boy . ultimate college movie
animal house is the best movie ever ! (especially for college students) . john belushi hysterical + it makes you want to go out do something crazy , like toga party
i never get tired of this movie . a great story , good acting and some unbelievable action - the train wreck is especially compelling there something riveting about stories which deal with wrongfully accused fugitive mesmerizing throughout probably my favorite harrison ford tommy lee jones superb as well also you have to love simpsons episode begins bart writing on blackboard will not tell people homework was stolen by one-armed man
animal house is one of the most realistic + funniest movies all time .
two comedy giants at the height of their powers sharing a magical chemistry between themselves . scene where steve martin's character lets loose an obscenity laced tirade smiling rental car agent (played by edie mcclurg) and her response to him is hysterical this oddly matched pair forced share same space for period long days leaving frustrated edgy quest get home in time thanksgiving finally resolved following outrageous series misadventures precurser chris farley-david spade pairings but on more adult level must see film

the best comedy to come out of 1980s . without a doubt , it is john candy's movie it's shame he didn't get more roles like this one may very well be that cemented fact steve martin could funny putting an arrow through his head r rating little misleading if not for 30 f-bombs drops in car rental scene probably would have gotten pg-13 pg

too many classic scenes to mention . funny from top bottom credits one of the best musical scores any comedy ever candy's work martin hasn't been that since
classic .
harrison ford did a marvelous job! ! :)
one of the funniest movies and greatest comedy cast ever . up there on classic list!! ! hey , always good when underdog comes out top
probably considered a guy movie , but classic all the same . makes you want to go out and buy naked lady tees after watching it
classic . how could a person not appreciate this movie ? bill murray is hilarious and thats all you need to know
bill murray and rodney dangerfield made this movie great . they stole the show right out from under chevy chase how can you not love a golf with belly dancing gopher?? ?
forever quotable ! it's unbelievable that this 25 year-old comedy hasn't gotten stale . so many funny characters (chase , dangerfield knight and of course murray) the story (although uncomplicated) is enough to join all hilarity together but still allows be
cannonball !
ya know how you go out to the video store rent a good movie for evening and look 20-30 minutes just can't find anything appealing ? so what do usually end up with in your bag (no pun intended) when leave store...caddyshack ! king of comedys
bill murray is the funniest actor ever .
murray .
awesome movie ! harrison ford and tommy lee jones were great
except for animal house (and maybe airplane) , no comedy movie has begat more catch-phrases (e.g . - it's in the hole!! ! noonan noonan) than caddyshack from start to finish this serves up laughs on something that is hard make fun of -- urbane sport golf while dangerfield chevy chase and bill murray delivered some their greatest comedic work a ted knight earns medalist honors as outrageous judge schmails i dug primitive animotronic gopher dancing with girl newport rhode island she commented danced like needless say did not score night if you have never seen are missing out one great pleasures life p.s ladyshark was baby ruth...mistaken u-know-what
a great , movie . chevy chase and bill murray at the funniest ! kill golfers
directed by harold ramis , caddyshack (1980) is one of those films that should not work but does primarily because the on-screen talent . story a group loosely tied subplots involving an upscale private golf course namely caddy from wrong side tracks danny noonan (michael o'keefe) eccentric trust fund prodigy ty webb (chevy chase) stuffy egocentric partner in club judge smails (ted knight) obnoxious nouveau riche al czervik (rodney dangerfield) and assistant groundskeeper carl spackler (bill murray) humor often crude jumbled completely non-cerebral as characters deliver one-liners situation gags ; nevertheless there place for this type comedy it has never been done any better bottom line epitome guy film
a very funny movie , the dancing gopher rocks ! caddyshack 2 however sucks .
the greatest golf movie next to happy gilmore
funniest golf movie ever . sorry happy gilmore
you take drugs danny ? everyday . good
it's probably a little too long , but daniel day lewis does good job as backwoodsman in the french and indian war north america (1754-1763) .
one of the greatest comedy movies i've seen . caddyshack was pretty funny , and had an excellent superb selection actors dangerfield's a classic !
castlebee , you must be lacking a sense of humor . look where this movie ranks it is classic
what a great movie . rodney dangerfield make me laugh even more each time i see this
needs to be in the top 5 . hilarious movie as a golf caddy i really can relate this is timeless and replay value infinite danny : thought you said winning wasn't everything ? ty me , no do good grammer -or- dangerfield that kangaroo stole my ball !
it amazes me people don't like this movie because is stupid . what were you expecting when watched a with bill murray , chevy chase and rodney dangerfield an intellectual genius of comedy ? was great i think very underrated in terms all time comedies
gungalagungala
gambling is illegal in bushwood and i never slice... .
it's got to be the lamest storyline around , but it is so hilarious that you can't stop laughing long enough consider . rodney his usual self ans he leads this excellently cast movie bill murray pits (literally)
one of the all time greats . has bill murray , chevy chase and rodney dangerfield- just an out great cast them get straight act down playing fool without being a downright entertaining
what a funny movie with so many great and memorable lines characters . ted knight rodney dangerfield are hysterical chevy chase's humor is dry understated that you really have to pay close attention he saying realize how the but it bill murray who steals in ways it's cinderella story former greenskeeper about become masters champion
classic performances by chevy chase , bill murray and rodney dangerfield . you owe it to yourself see this movie is so funny
this movie is hillarious !
this is one of my favorite movies . original , and it seems to me pioneering for its time i can still watch with extreme enjoyment a perfect combination good characters humor intrigue action
chevy chase is brilliant and rodney dangerfield plays a good jerk--very loud very obnoxious . it's worth owning
a classic comedy from my childhood era . still love to watch it especially when comes on unexpectedly weekend afternoon and i get sit around snacking laughing at all the wacky antics over again it's like an unexpected gift that you enjoy even more because didn't know was coming
an all-time classic .
pound for , the funniest sports oriented movie and maybe one of ever .
this movie was an extremely funny . the characters and plot are hysterical i highly recommed
um , yeeeaaah . i was wondering if you got the memo this movie is hilarious ookaaayy ? greeeaatt thaaannks say "i believe have my swingline stapler" line all time haven't seen it just go rent you'll enjoy
the last action sequence in this movie is best i've ever seen . it starts with duncan tied to a stake and set on fire trade which allows others go free , then daniel day lewis shoots from afar so that he won't suffer one of english sisters jumps off mountain commits suicide rather than be captive moguia indians mohegan son fights nobly but killed pushed father kills indian ; all some great background violin music i get teary-eyed every time watch
i believe you have my stapler
holy crap , what a classic
thinking about taking that chick from logistics to the party . if everything goes right i'm gonna be showing her my oooh face ; you know ooooh i love this movie and it still makes me laugh even though have seen 50 times
yeahhhhhh , this movie is hilarious . mmmmmkay ? thaaaaaaaaanks
hilarious ! i have never worked in the cube environment , but movie still makes you think about all crappy jobs you've had and ways to plot revenge against your bosses . i'm surprised it didn't do well at box office...but definitely developed following after was released on video/dvd
quite possibly the greatest movie ever made . while that might be a stretch to some , i found this comedy hilarious parody of normal worker's life smartly pokes at office lifestyle and how it can drive person mad
one of my favorite movies all time . superb scenery but a little violent i loved it
i've never worked in an office before but i think the theme of wanting to escape a spirit-crushingly tedious job is one that has fairly universal appeal . boss spot-on as wannabe good leader whose attempts be emollient are horribly grating with his needlessly elongated syllables and patronizing manner best scene when three central characters take symbolically oppressive photocopier secluded place start smash it up slow motion strains gangster rap music definitely film watch work getting you down
greatest film ever made ! deserves eight stars you disagree , you're wrong .
i love it . ron livingston is hilarious , and now everytime see him in something think of as the office space guy great movie to watch with a big group friends
released in 1999 and directed by mike judge (of beavis butthead king of the hill fame) , office space is a somewhat dark comical spot-on satire modern white-collar business environment . peter gibbons (ron livingston) computer programmer who goes through change philosophy starts to act out his true apathy towards job which spills over some co-workers (david herman ajay naidu) bland also reflected social life namely an average apartment eating at restaurants oddly enough this new outlook gives him courage ask attractive waitress (jennifer aniston) suffering from work as well speak mind pair efficiency experts have been hired downsize company resulting unexpected promotion besides absurdity everyday what makes film livingston's intentionally flat performance suggests inertia hopelessness situation stephen root's portrayal milton invisible ignored employee gary cole robotic boss soundtrack features rap other music that seemingly runs contrary sterile examines bottom line extremely funny yet poignant examining contemporary politics
this movie is smart , funny and hits the spirit of corporate america right in gonads . lines catch-22 brilliant i loved it
the greatest , most cathartic movie for anyone who has ever hated their job had an arse a boss or piece of office equipment that never seemed to work right you . it's good see these poor schmucks get everything they don't deserve
a great true to life comedy about the workplace . can relate , being in my early twenties and surrounded by all these corporate buttheads whose only concern is their wallets this movie did not do very well theaters but video dvd has been top seller
i thought this movie was hilarious!! ! can't wait to see mike judge's next project!!
funniest office movie ever .
if you've ever worked (been stuck) in an office/cubical job then this movie is for you . hate your , fantasize about coming one day and not giving a damn blowing off boss even burning whole place of employment down than watch it's very theraputic those us wishing we didn't have to suffer thru work (anyone who doesn't like obviously hasn't suffered at enough!)
i watch this every time it's on tv ! so funny , the actors are great and it has some of funniest jokes ever . love milton who always mumbles about his stapler eventually burns down building
the regular cubicle-working , engineer guys and gangsta rap come together to make some of most hilarious stuff i have ever seen on a movie (enough compete with even great monty python!) .
for anyone who has worked in the computer division of a large company can appreciate humor this movie . i loved we all know boss , bill lumberg woman cubicle next to us with most annoying voice memo's that everyone but you got etc.. alot mindless also some intelligent things just have be smart enough catch it
if you've ever worked in an office , this movie will really hit home . it's hilarious ; a classic
hilarious !
i believe you have my stapler !
i think this movie is really funny , good work !
i'm going to show her my ohhh face... .  ,
office space doesn't have the best plot in world , but boy is it funny . if you've ever worked a cubicle filled or are software engineer this movie perfect for laugh reminds me lot of dilbert you like comics will probably enjoy same humor i don't know how many times my friends and quoted great lines ( sounds someone has case mondays ) while at work it's too to count characters hilarious especially michael bolton there was nothing wrong with name until about 12-years-old that no-talent ass clown became famous starting winning grammies mr lumburg boss watch several really pick up all deserves more attention than got no-name actors (except jennifer aniston) must your comedy collection
absolutely hysterical . it stars ron livingston , gary cole jennifer aniston plays a guy who just doesn't like going to work....so he decides simply not go anymore one of the funniest movies i've ever seen it's written by mike judge (beavis butthead) and based on comic strip milton highly reccomended
a rare gem in decade of pretty lousy comedies .
your f**kin stupid if u dont like this film .
this film is magnificent ! beautiful to watch , under the control of michael manns assured direction . performances are universally great especially wes studi's evil scout
another one of my all-time favorites ! ben stiller is a comic genius . teamed up w/ de niro was too much
i especially like the part with cat on toilet.. .
a very hilarious movie . ben stiller to do other types of movies though
this is a great movie . written by james fenimore cooper , the film action-filled look at history through battles it type of where you sit there after see attempting to contemplate what just witnessed
i can't wait to see the new one . this was funniest movies have seen in a long time
if you can find a funnier movie , i will kiss your ass! ! does not get any better than this one .
this is great ! i watch all the time and never get tired of it . would be a good movie to on thanksgiving
my favorite comedy . almost non-stop laughs , and a nice mixture of sophisticated humor slapstick hope the sequel lives up to original
my family & i loved this movie we are excited about seeing meet the faukers can hardly wait hope to see it real soon
it was funny of course had ben stillard in . yeah i liked virile vagablood am pretty sure who ever is here has seen the movie so you dont have to type whole back cover ok thanks.(and cats name jinxie)
just about the funniest movie i had seen in a long time . one of rare movies that can watch over &
this film is hilarious !
this is by far one of my favorite movies all time . robert deniro and ben stiller were awesome together in movie it was also the funniest moveies i have ever seen would definately recommend to anyone who has never
i have nipples . can you milk me ? ben stiller and robert deniro are fantabulous in this movie it was great to see take a break from the tough guy roles do something as funny i'm just hoping that meet fockers will be good !
this is one of the funniest movies ever! ! it brings families together laughing & having a great time!!!!!
funniest movie of the year 2000
alot of people don't really care for this one . i think it was put together very well and robert deniro isn't a half bad comedy actor , he is such good serious what makes him actually funny in these comedies does ben stiller plays off pretty his girlfriend flick freaking hot you gotta love owen wilsons nose.....great movie
off the chain
hilarious antics movie with great characters that seems real . awesome quick humor
actually , you can milk anything with nipples . i have greg me ?
unbelievably funny!!!...deniro can do it all...just his facial expressions alone,cracked me up.his relationship with jinxie...stabilized deniro as a true sensitive comedian when called upon . stiller's need to impress the parents,still brings smile my face..right up there ferris,bill murray,and even john candy movies...rent again!! !
i liked this movie,i watched it over and over.it was a very funny movie .
the best love story ever ! this movie ecompasses all aspects of between a woman and man . historical setting revolutionary times in america make it more beautiful native who falls with daughter an english general their withstood war , death time
gaylord focker .
one of the funniest movies i've ever seen ! it was jsut hilarious , ben stiller great and robert deniro really intimidating as father in law .
i thought this movie was really funny . robert de niro does a great job with his role as an overprotective father while normally hate ben stiller , he it's to watch if you need laugh
great movie . i could not stop laughing through the whole thing !
one of my favorite movies all time . de nero plays a convincing intimidating dad (wouldn't you be?) , and ben stiller great goofball who only wants to do the right thing
i thought that this is one of the best romantic comedies since as good it gets  . rather coincidental both these films revolve somewhat around animals (the dog in and jinxy cat film) thoroughly enjoyed film laughed my tail off from start to finish- there were a lot funny memoriable parts will always stick with me when think acting was supurb movie great- anyone who thinks otherwise just focker
funny stuff
this is the funniest movie i have ever seen and after viewing it several times , still laugh just as hard first time ! originally saw in a crowded theater thank god everyone else found funny did people were laughing so loudly was literally tears you think of robert deniro serious actor he one greatest all however shows his comedic talent truthfully can not thing like about movie.....no that right thing...it had to end
a retake on the book classic and early original movie of same name , last mohicans is an engaging epic chronicaling events mohican his natural son adopted white . this in its scope soundtrack acting setting : french indian war eastern part north american continent
listen fockers..this movie is funny . if it doesn't make you laugh your passed out i can't wait till the sequal meet fockers comes when his parents come to visit
stiller is one of the funniest people around , and deniro a great comic actor . whole story i cant wait for sequel
yes ! this was a witty , hilarious movie that really does the right thing . absolutely not to be missed stiller and deniro give great performances it's damn original rent it now you won't regret summary : an unmissable
great movie . would recommend to anyone
i really enjoyed this movie . it was so funny !
can you deal with that !
i really enjoyed this movie because love u.s . history think was an excellent it tells the story of revolution from a side that most people have no idea about is moving film aquaints many americans with truth try to hide- we destroyed native
this movie is da bomb!!!! ! ben stiller was great and it just the best i've ever seen!!!! hilarious!!!! go meet parents !!!!
this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen in my enitre life . ben stiller a phenomenal actor and comedian
a captivating glimpse at american history during the time of french and indian war . daniel day lewis gives wonderful performance as courageous white man raised by indians very compelling adventure
i had high expectations for this movie and they were met . don't usually laugh out loud at movies but made me love ben stiller , he is a funny bastard ! was histerical from begining to end all the crap that poor innocent guy has go through win over his fiance's father you really do feel bad him can't help want more stuff happen because comedy sequences are just too
it's just a game , focker ! are you kidding me ? this was one hell of funny movie . who gives rats ass about the story not freaking godfather morons comedy suppose to make laugh and it sure as made many times over
hilarious and engaging . i'll see it 10 more times if i'm giving the chance robert de niro acts a lot like my father in movie lol one of reasons why i so much is because reminds me dad :o)
it was a great movie and is becoming classic . one of those movies you'd enjoy to see again i saw this in high school because my teacher loved too
side splittingly funny without being scatalogical or vulgar . ben stiller is a comic genius
this movie was hillarious! ! it really deserves 5 stars
i needed to relax and enjoy myself this hit the spot .
very loving and heart warming story about the mohican indians . great action throughout movie !
it's a really good movie . i recomend seeing it !
a very funny , super-likable movie that capitalizes on anxiety we all feel about meeting significant other's family for the first time . ben stiller plays good-hearted everyman to perfection so it's absolutely distressing watch him stumble through this series of (hilarious) misfortunes though i've never been huge robert deniro fan he is rather convincing as intimidating father negative side fails develop female character well (to point you'll wish stiller's would just give up since she doesn't seem worth suffering endures) and happy ending gets stitched together pretty unconvincingly but these are small nitpicks -- overall an excellent comedy (together with something mary) establishes one hollywood's most reliably leading men
this was hilarious , and in some respects realistic as of the best attorneys didn't shine law school .
beautifully depicted the life of french indian war . good battle scenes , with a romantic and heroic fame to it
a great movie to watch over and !
this is a great film . if you have never seen movie , shame on it very funny
definitely hysterical .
loved it ! the jail scene was hysterical , and marisa tomei's character great .
funny , movie . marisa tomei was great in this but who else joe pesci can go from the murderous gangsters casino and goodfellas to brooklynite lawyer my cousin vinnie never miss a beat gotta give him credit
one of the best comedies i've seen in a long time . pesci is great , but my hat really off to marisa tomei new york/brooklyn accents are superb and just what called for this movie it watch fred gwynne doing something other than herman munster - he does very well indeed grits ? grit only tremendous lines i agree with lancer abut porch scene being hilarious another favorite mine talking about poor little dee-uh if you have not yet rent video or dvd guaranteed brighten your day you're feeling down
2 breakfasts please ! lol da two yutes.. . the what ? 'da yutes'. did you say yutes 'sorry your honor yoouuuthhzzzzz this movie was cute and funny from start to finish scene on porch of cabin between joe peci' marisa tomei hysterical.. as when his suit gets ruined he has walk into court wearing a ridiculous mid 1800's that got at second hand store im laughing just thinking about it
love it !
very funny , well scripted with a great performance by marisa tomei . pesci is good and the supporting cast turn in strong performances
great movie . marissa tomei and joe pesci did a job fred gwynne was good choice for the judge paradoy of city slickers in small southern town , without exploting insulting stereotypes south
mohicans is a hecka bloody movie , but its got so much emotional stuff . it throws your emotions around one minute you're yelling die ! then crying everyone should see
what a funny concept . new york city boy way out in the boonies , sporting his hey yo attitude conservative southern courtroom tons of laughs on both and country sides if you haven't seen it should
best legal comedy ever ! two scenes come to mind imediately when you mention this film me . scene one : in the cafe , vinny picks up menu shows his girlfriend 'so what do think breakfast?' 'breakfast sounds good.' then they show with three things on it ; breakfast lunch dinner court room is crossing a witness 'isn't possible that yout's...' 'say what?' 'excuse your honor' 'what was word?' 'what?' 'did say youts?' 'yeah.' yout?' 'oh pardon honor youthssssss.'
the best comedy ! i laughed until my sides split joe pesci is such a wonderful actor . how could anyone who's brain mostly intact not like this movie ? whoever thought up character of vinny was true genius hope to see again , maybe i'll rent it weekend people if you are feeling down perfect watch will laugh till exhausted fun hilarious (the way they make all rednecky accents fun-ny!) who hasn't seen terrific
i love harrison ford as indiana jones , he is so classic .
so comical especially the scene with misunderstanding of arrest .
this movie is so amesomely funny . i am on a mission from god to give 5
a 5 spot for the music .
i've seen it 20 times and could easily see more . great music , comedy action a nice story to boot what cast ! two fried chickens coke coming up
dan ackroyd and john belushi are comic geniuses , this is there masterpiece work . some trully hilarious moments the soundtrack featured of best blues you will ever hear laughs come a mile minute so put on your sunglasses fill up tank sit back enjoy two hours absolute comedy at its finesy
i enjoy the music in this movie as much , if not more than comedy it (which is a bit too subtle at points counting mall scene.)
this movie always makes me smile . great comedy and a team (belushi akroyd) set to fantastic soundtrack
good fun , music and all the car crashes you could want . avoid sequel like would an hiv positive hooker
jake and elwood blues on a mission from god , the great cameos car chase/car crash scene best of all music what wasn't to like . still as funny today it was over 20 years ago
classic in every way . sir ? sir? ! sir!!
an all-time classic . i think it's a law somewhere...if you're from chicago , you have to like this movie
dealt with history and a love story that was action packed thrilling . good chick flick but also caters to machoism highly recommended
i love this crazy old movie ! it seems weird to think is now over 21 years was the very best of all snl inspired movies (if you don t believe me , rent coneheads eeek!) . not only that probably one if left us summing up talents john belushi he gave a performance here really encompassed his unique comedic abilities both past and present with bittersweet hint what might have been my favorite part (and there were so many classic bits choose from) when two brothers went back orphanage visit penguin  she finally has enough them starts hitting ruler - they try run but jake can squeeze out desk sitting in no choice roll down stairs pure silly slapstick still makes laugh head off every time
i liked this movie a great deal . used to watch it all the time however , is shame that belushi dead and akroyd old fat by way danny loved your work in my stepmom an alien 
john belushi and dan ackroyd star as ex-felons on a mission from god to raise money save an orphanage . they set out gather the members of their (musical) band throw concert with musical cameos by aretha franklin , stevie wonder others comparable movie would be impossible make today any fan blues music needs watch this
i think this movie was great ! absolutely loved it and thought hilarious . good music too
'the' best musical ever made
classic !
belushi and ackroyd on a mission from god . hellelujah ! some fine music , too
blues brothers is a classic and will always be considered an amazing movie .
i loved last of the mohicans because it told native american roots . was directed and produced beautifully never once did get lost or confused in movie main actors were really great taking you into journey that era
in my opinion , this is the funniest film i have ever seen it intelligent humour with some unexpected twists to keep you laughing whole way through . would definitely recommend all
a funny movie that will go down in the classic department . everytime i see it still laugh and love movies friendships develope strangest places !
eddie murphy and dan a . are great contrasting characters , representing the haves have nots in eighties very comical view
always a pleasure to watch trading places . most all of eddie murphy's early movies were great , and this is no exception
a classic comedy with great cast . eddie murphy at his best !
never saw the ending coming . shocked crap out of me best m night shymalan's films
fantastic movie- good story , script acting and very humorous.. . ....
this movie was great . it gave you the chance to see how people on different sides can come together
about a bum that was taken off the street and put in place of rich guy , could see anybody do anything .
possibly the best movie eddie murphy ever made . who wouldn't want to hang out with billy ray valentine ? whisky.. all you !
i thought this was an awsome movie .
eddie murphy and dan akroyd at their absolute best..jamie lee looks incredible , is quite sweet as the hooker turned girlfriend  . this movie belongs on every list or classic comedies still makes me laugh today !
the python boys are at it again scoring big with their first fully realized story (discounting seldom seem , soon forgotten "jabberwocky" which appeared two or three years before this release) chronicling saga of brian cohen who was born in a manger next door to that messiah on very same night as savior's birth . series mishaps and mistaken identities (played by late graham chapman) is hounded roman soldiers would be diciples believe him "true" lustful groupies rival religious factions using naughty english schoolboy attack they noted for television classic "monty holy grail" further spoof christianity many splinter groups all claim true only believers sacred teachings while full frontal popular organized religion may have caused film less well attended than previously mentioned "holy unlike it's predecessor (which exists primarily group skits loosely woven around centralized theme) has continuity leads an eventual resolution plot more memorable scenes include : brian's introduction members 'people's front judea' (sp?) working vendor during matinee show local gladitorial bloodbath ("owls ears ! wren's spleens otter's noses wolf nipple chips get em they're hot lovely...") michael palin appearing street fast talking begger ("alms old ex-leper.") who's calling life become compromised after being cured his disease jesus ("bloody do-gooder!") film's climax fellow unfortunates hanging crosses awaiting final demise eric idle sings whistful paean worldly existance refrain "always look bright side life..." you'll leave screening clutching your stomach sides aching from belly laughs tears laughter rolling down cheeks whistling melody will never head
very creepy . the end was frustrating , because like so many others i said "of course ! should have seen that coming duh!"
more about politics than religion , although the satire really applies to groups based on causes in general .
you've got to look on the bright side of life .
a shamelessly funny look at brian who is falsly accused of being the messiah . he's not you know any way gets in to all kinds trouble with his big nose and pythons helm it could be funnier can't have baby ! don't womb!!
one of my favorite python films ! the ending is especially hillarious .
they are so funny ! just crack me up everytime
scandalous , heretical and absolutely hilarious . john cleese's turn as the centurian correcting brian's latin is priceless
if you like monty python your life isn't complete when didn't see this masterpiece .
when a comedy is clever it good , takes well known subject pulls to pieces puts back together again through the minds of six genius can only be described as brilliant !
had me laughing from the first scene , to last .
do you find something humouwous abowt my fwiend , bigus dickus ?
one of the funniest films all time..never once have i not laughed . and dont forget. he is messiah,he`s a very naughty boy
monthy python is genius of comedies and humour . they're the greatest comedy gang ever life brian a really funny good movie it will make you laugh..trust me i love all their movies episodes python's flying circus them forever =)
monty python are the kings of comedy . life brian is absolutely hilarious ( i have a good fweind in wome (rome) , his name bigus dickus ) it real scream trust me if your fanatical christian or something get over and see this movie prove that they funniest summary : film
i love this movie ! think it out does the holy grail , funny stuff last scene is one of my favorites classic compleats perfectly bad ass
brilliant!...from the beginning to superlative ending . m knight's greatest success and his failure , cuz now everything he makes will be judged by standard set for himself in this movie
i'm brian and so is my wife.. .
people called romans , they are going to house
he's not the messiah , a very naughty boy
no words can describe the excelency !
you're all individuals .
when this film was first released , it had the christian community in an uproar as they though defiling jesus' name . on a chatshow john cleese and michael palin war of words against one ministers - something any python fan should watch itself is highly entertaining carries with sense humour that present all work my favourite line has to be 'he's not messiah he's very naughty boy' me fiance have films because we adore them so much !
i cant believe this is rated pg 13 , let my little sisters watch they cried . thougt were seeing dead people walking around the house moaning and screaming for there tender 10 yr old flesh it took me a week to get them realize was just grandma !
well , they done it again ! four years after their hilarious trammeling of king arthur and his poor knights (monty python the holy grail 1974) brits john cleese eric idle graham chapman michael palin terry jones expatriate american friend gilliam have a go at biblical conventions . widely condemned time it's release (indeed banned in ireland altogether-guess thats one thing catholics protestants were able to agree on!) as being sacriligious is apparent viewing film that such outcries came from people who never bothered watch first this nothing new now was then anything even hints irreverence brings 'em out woodwork concerns itself with brian cohen self-described red sea pedestrian  adventures roman occupied judea circa 33 ad becomes involved an anti-roman resistance movement when he caught painting romans home forum night by soldier proceeds punish him for bad grammar (he made paint phrase 100 times!) forced flee into marketplace there blend joins many messiahs vying audience gains following very much against will proves be undoing undone only pythons can undo whereas really series skits built around central theme life has linear storyline always are flights fancy nonsequitur would not true without these but fewer more controlled integral here two movies equally funny different ways polished somewhat restrained effort all familiar hallmarks : most women's parts played men hilariously drag almost roles six themselves support some secondary crowd scenes memorable (to say least) interpretations historical figures (though those expecting mockery jesus disappointed appears once long-shot film's opening delivering sermon on mount object scene's humor bickering amongst is.) palin's pontius pilate sounding world like elmer fudd worth watching you'll cracking up over days ( what about name biggus dickus ? i vewy gweat fwiend wome ) climaxes my knowledge musical crucifixion other than christ superstar (1973) promise you funnier
this is easily the best comedy ever made . there isn't even another movie in life of brian's rear view mirror chapman and boys reached their pinnacle with one
i have long been a fan of monty python , and currently own all their feature films several episodes the old tv show . life brian was amazingly scripted with just enough biblical references to make it seem historical yet blasphemous be funny incredibly insulting religious people
what's so special about the cheese makers ? he doesn't mean per se , rather of dairy products in general .
i loved this movie ! it was by far the funniest i've seen in all my life .
this was the cohn bros funniest movie , next to raising arizona .
one of my all time favorites movies .
dang ! we're in a tight spot great music and cast that all played their parts well . loosely based on the odyssey by homer , if you are familiar with story it's fun to watch for signs like cyclopes john goodman
i watched it never suspecting the twist at end.... .
this was a very funny and entertaining movie . i actually like george clooney for couple of hours
very funny , witty brilliantly scripted and not a bad performance in the cast . soundtrack ain't either oh george livestock
brilliant coen brothers film . proved to me clooney could act of course how can you not enjoy a farce based on homer ? anyway the cast was superb featuring lot regulars stand outs are tim blake nelson as delamr(sp) and john goodman in his small role big dan always , quote do seek treasure we...thought..you...was..a...toad
this is one of the best characters i have ever seen george clooney play . really appreciated him branching out
i love this movie . laugh so hard every time that see it ! really like the part where they are singing for blind guy...its great
surprisingly entertaing little movie . based very loosly on the homerian epic oddessy this has some funny moments it rewatchablity soundtrack is a nice change from ordinary
i think this movie is a little more subtle than other comedies . the comedy comes not from plot , really but characterization clooney funny because he's so cocky and 'dapper' his two partners in crime are too many lines they're shoved yoour face some people can watch without seeing anything at all laughed beginning to end great characters movies music (and don't even like country that much) despite yellow-ish nature of film it's very beautiful
one of the best films ever made....you can watch it over and .
go indy !
it was a very funny movie,it deserves 5 stars .
if you ain't from the south it just funny enough.just like fargo
great all around movie . not overwhelmingly funny , but it has its moments i can see where some people wont like for those who do will become one of their favorites
i absolutely loved this movie . it's one of those few films that captures a little place in the past somewhere and just creates world with eccentric characters , everyone is on quest when their paths cross hilarity ensues grandiose scale every aspect cinematography music sound editing blend to create absolute perfection hilarious as well best laugh out loud cohen brothers have done
i didn't see this until the dvd came out . wish had seen it in theatre because is one of my all time favorites a lot people get humor , but did and laughed loud on quite few occasions some have to their comedies hit them face like sledgehammer order doesn't do that that's what about
this is one of the very best mainstream movies produced in last ten years . i've seen it five times now , and every time i see like more (it's rare for me to watch a movie than twice) music incredible characters are sympathetic accessible oftentimes hilarious script well-written that scene at end with nooses men digging graves singing lonesome valley gives goose bumps
coen brothers best movie ever . smart , funny complex enough to lose the dullards and culturally inferior simple annoy arthouse elite in short perfect
i just saw this the other night at bidding of a friend (thanks , liz!) and loved it . some odyssey in but as i'm not high school english teacher was able to enjoy both spite because mangling homer's plot kinda wish they'd included parts about calypso circe oh well also smug suburban jerk who feels he has run out local 'record town' buy an important soundtrack right after sees movie so my opinion might actually be worth something incredibly entertaining have say that acting best i've seen long while george clooney really surprised me- never liked him before even john turturro used annoy me all heroes ifc do freakin amazing tim blake nelson- where did guy come from ? charles durning steven root.. hell good cast 'the big lebowski' - thought cohen brothers had gone too far with 'fargo' is great alright soundtrack's f'n
best movie i've seen in some time . i'm not a george clooney fan , but he was wonderful this film it does require suspension of disbelief (like all movies) for those willing to provide is well worth the effort and no you don't have read homer's odyssey enjoy
i absolutely loved this movie and have seen it 3 times now because want my friends to see too watched with them . is not only very funny , but also intelligent astute observations about our culture references literature classic film (e.g wizard of oz) basically a road set in the depression-era south performances by three leads are outstanding never been fan george clooney before thought he did hell good job smart comic role as know-it-all scheming leader trio escaped cons kudos tim blake nelson sweet dumb (as bag hammers) con john turturro gangly angry music wonderful though am bluegrass anyway it's surprising kind hit popular chord - unslick unaffected touches history coen brothers done again different way..
this movie is a must see if you have not seen it and no one has told about . will blow your mind certainly made impact on me i would love to sequel but maybe just best leave as the classic
an endlessly watchable film . a great cast makes this movie engaging from start to finish wonderful music and beautiful cinematography.it'll have you humming the songs quoting lines for long time ! these guys , coens are just plain geniuses
this is the best movie . if you haven't seen it rent and you'll love to
timeless masterpiece...that's all that can be used to describe this film .
this is a film that should never be missed by anyone . after all , you have to sear believer !
this is an excellant movie and a great dvd set . the charecters are wonderful story it borrows magnificently from some of best movies around
one of the best films i've ever seen
this movie is great for a stoner or anyone with an open mind that tends to notice the small stuff . i remember several times going whoa because recognized something was foreshadowed earlier my recomendation : smoke blunt and enjoy!! !
i loved this movie . it is actually very complex with wonderful allusions to other movies , works of literature and popular culture such the wizard oz moby dick early recording industry has satire loaded entendre as john goodman cyclops both homer kkk ! for anyone educated in history worthy repeated viewing those less literate these areas would suggest they see something else asked my son meaning his reply : it's simple dad like odyssey a symbolic journey through life all its fun adventures misfortunes triumphs
i loved this film . thought it was a clever script and just had lot of fun watching even enjoyed the music...and it's not usually kind music enjoy cast fabulous...see be prepared to laugh !
i was scared to death!! ! never thought could be of a movie like that it great!!!way 2 go!!
the movie has a few serious moments , which don't really do it any credit but when it's funny hilarious .
one of my favorites . when i was younger could watch this movie over and haven't seen it in years but just thinking about gives me good nostalgia michael keaton great contrast character he played against the batman you realize what a different sort guy is loved all scenes barbara adam are that waiting room there to see juno some funny stuff with teeny tiny little head , swimmer shark eating half his body bone throat (actually looked pretty disgusting) rest animation cool too
this one is a classic ! come on . sure the plot was bit out of whack , but acting and dialogue made movie so hilarious my favorite scene probably either wedding at end or when bettlejuice trying to get lydia guess his name michael keaton perfect choice for role i'll always enjoy watching movie- it's i'm ghost with most babe
micheal keaton's shining moment . this is a true must-see in the comedy world
great movie! ! i love it when beetlejuice knocks down the tree and says nice f---ing model!!
how can anyone give this movie a four? ! beetlejucice is classic . not only was the great , but cartoon funny as hell literally good film to watch when you want see michael keaton in his prime
when i saw this movie really loved it . thought was hilarious weird , but funny
sir , you have 19.........hit me i like to live dangerously....21.........i'll stay........sir 5........i also dangerously
awesome ! it was something new and mike myers is genius in his ability to play so many characters make each one unique
this movie is great if you want to watch a film make chuckle (particulalry you've seen many of the brit spy like james bond , ipcress files etc) . it doesn't really engage your brain but then does every have be heavy and intellectual ?
one of my all time favorites . austin powers is groovy , baby yeah !
genius ! a very quotable and funny movie .
it'sa great spoof movie , and i like how they went after james bond pop culture in general . this is the kind of that you notice something different each time watch it some scenes are really funny though there isn't much a plot it's
austin powers is full of laughs yeah baby! !
incredibly funny spoof of the james bond films . introduces you to some characters and shows tired old coincidences that are in movies
mike myers is the man
very funny . it will make you laugh
austin powers friggin rocks !! ! oh,behave!!!!! yeah baby yeah!!!!
austin powers , from the beginning to end is really funny . for instance when he dancing on street and cop walks up them they all stop then start again with too dr evil no doubt most lovable villain ever his wild schemes that always get messed make character excellent 5 stars sure
a very good movie in the end when you found out guy was dead that crasy i had to see more than ones .
man i cracked up in this . it was absolutely hilarious ! sometimes a bit stupid , like the whole pissing thing and robot voice but end thought ws funniest i'd ever seen well not really still pretty damn funny though get out watch you'll be hysterics austin powers will become an icon for cinema mike myers is brilliant summary : great must-see
i think fat bastard inpregnated me . (ha ha sikes) the movie is so funny was rollin
it was a great movie
mike myers is a comedic genius and that equals non-stop laughs . everything from her name alotta fagina , to ill-tempered mutated sea bass great humour
this is definatly a funny one.... .
how can someone not appreciate the comedy of mike myers , in a movie that my opinion will stay forever hall-of-fame ? austin powers is supposed to be about hilarious one-liners or sarcastic jokes . all character's expressions and faces situations which these characteristics are emphasized on individual order exaggerate it make uncontrollably funny what makes so unique hit different from anything else anyone has ever seen
definitely the best of trilogy and one action movies all-time . things that made it so great was indy just a seemingly average guy he didn't have any special powers in addition , movie wild effects more believable than most (with exception course climactic scene) if you've never seen this film what are you waiting for is harrison ford at his
i thought it was scary but love to scare myself so worth . sorta funny when stupid ghost don't know their dead ! m night shymalan went a little far making this happen child spoiler ahead  : here is bruce willis guess of me be shocked happend
oh my god ! this movie was so hilarious i could not stop laughing the first time watched it and still can't help myself even after over two hundred times of watching dr . evil is funny , scott drop-dead gorgeous austin powers 2 are favorite movies all
laughed my butt off !
this is definitely worth the watch . it's really funny and it keeps you interested throughout whole movie one of my favourite movies
one of the best . a truly revolutionary comedy mike myers delivers shagadelic performance hilariously funny ! it does what is suppose to do , makes you laugh
i like m . night shymalan's films so far , sixth sense has been his best it is creepy and suspenseful excellent acting from haley joel osment toni collete (a personal favorite) even bruce willis rocky the secret star of this movie city philadelphia being an old kind foreboding town film works exceptionally well there as opposed to let's say san diego ending caught me by surprise (which won't spoil for 1% you who have not seen yet) will when watching a second time was quite obvious worthwhile dvd rental
joybyc , do you know how to comment on movies ? then i will tell : you're suppose give a reason why didn't enjoy the movie not if liked it or thought sucked . it's only idiots like these people who put austin powers down everybody else (including me) thinks they're brilliant !
mike myers is funny as austin . the storyline was great music so right for this movie
probably from a personal preference , but one of the greatest comedies recent times . comedy derived stupidity appeals to me as well some ingenious jokes including behind couch journeys ! 2nd movie is equally hilarious
mike myers is absolutely brilliant in this film . sure , it over the top and much of humor crude but what other movie last 10 years has had as an impact on popular vernacular ? austin powers a true original one funnier movies nineties
laser
hilarious.. .
the funniest and most quotable movie ever !
austin powers was incredibly funny . i think most of its hilarity originated from the clever script and idea spoofing spy movies also , sophomoric gags kept me rolling with laughter
maybe i just lean towards black humor .
brilliant , a dark masterpiece on cold war era concerns with several different incredible performances by sellers and the always good george c . scott among others another great kubrick film
great movie- dark , intelligent and humorous .
released in 1964 , stanley kubrick's dr . strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb is cinema its finest art form while dominant cold war theme a bit dated now film serves practical purpose today namely give genuine feel of what conditions world was under during that time for subsequent generations notwithstanding strong undertones dark humor uninitiated basic story american air force general jack d ripper (sterling hayden) sends attack signal an airborne bomber piloted by maj t.j king kong (slim pickens) capt lionel mandrake (peter sellers) realizes crazy attempts contact president who barricaded room with his advisors hawkish gen buck turgidson (george c scott) ex-nazi as well russian ambassador bull) men debate merits letting chips fall trying doing best fulfill duties nuclear combat toe russkies eventually rides big one down after freeing jammed casting superb sellers playing three parts (originally four until pickens cast which much better) interesting contrast failsafe (1964) has same yet straight color back white comedy bottom line reaches pinnacle remains relevant other similar themed movies are outdated
oh this is a true classic ! sellers in one of his best performences . i especially like dr strangelove himself
the black comedy of comedies , with particularly good performances by sellars (all three them) and a totally over top slim pickens .
a work of genius , one the most brilliant black comedies ever made . i always laugh out loud at airplanes getting it on in opening scene next time you watch consider that dr strangelove (who assumed to be edward teller) might actually henry kissinger (unlikely because hk was still relatively obscure 1964--but resemblance is disturbing indeed)
the blackest of all black comedies . kubrick is brilliant
this movie truly does what a thriller should and ought to do hasn't been doing since the days of alfred hitchcock . it wasn't until we finished viewing film that certain questions started creep on our psyche consciences is there life after death ? are alive living or walking entities hayley joel osment was outstanding as cole sear who kept dark secret from his unsuspecting mother - having ability see ghosts bruce willis surprised me he actually quite good has be best out all m night shymalan's films date
really thought provoking film . it's exremely funny , and you can't help but laugh...and then you're forced to stop think how scary it is that these seemingly ridiculous situations involving nuclear war could happen i don't our political leaders today have any more sense than the ones in peter sellers brilliant at playing a variety of characters within film...there nobody who equals his versatility respect !
this is probably the weirdest film i have ever seen , and am a fan of yellow submarine  wall american beauty . it evokes its humor mood from such irony that most effective movie i've without gratuitous sex violence or language we see what's happening alone enough to keep you on your toes where else but in would vending machine hold fate humanity ? famous image lt kong riding bomb as falls ground just ties up so much it's sickening great all-around if haven't do by all means although cold war long over holds relevance today...
i admit didn't get this remarkably dark humor at first but warmed up to it every viewing . now think it's absolutely hilarious with the sexual symbolism , metaphors and what-not those who like should try watching again because people are sure miss something only one heil kubrick !
this is a comedy ?
this satire about nuclear war is stanley kubrick's best film . it was made in 1964 , before he went crazy and a clockwork orange 1971 peter seller's performance what makes movie george c scott pretty good too not only kubick's also my opinion the of sixties comedy ever
the cult film of 1960's . aside from being amazingly funny it was also a well deserved jab at right wing hawks and military stupidity times peter sellers beyond excellent nothing said over zealous droid like slim pickins' character as he happily rides bomb to his death yeeeehawwwwww ! gotta love
a very good thriller movie . well played by all the actors haley joel osment is little boy who can see ghosts bruce willis child psychiatrist tries to help him it has enough suspence without being too gory surprise ending kind of like twilight zone
the opening scene of b-52's being refueled above clouds with relaxing music is one my favorite movie scenes . i would love a wallpaper background
hilarious especially when ever he got pissed off at the ball it wouldn't go in . or beat crap out of guy becuase hole was tryin' but just him and bob barker into a fight uttered those words that i think everyone wanted to say -the price is wrong b***h-
own it . love adam sandler and julie bowen
i love this movie , there was one summer (98 believe) when my friends and would watch it nearly every day we were at camp . never got old
omg , so funny !
went to see this at the cinema with a friend who decided tell me what twist was 10 minutes into sodding film . i still totally and utterly enjoyed though for past ten years or so bruce willis has really flourished in diverse roles that he taken outshines haley joel osmand shows depth plays his role convincingly toni colette mother held up standard of acting very emotional sometimes scary is definately worth watching
adam sandler's best movie . it's especially funny for any former football or baseball player who's taken up golf as a weekend hobby doin the bull dance.. feelin flow
oh yes i love adam sandler he is fantastic makes me laugh and my whole family hope keeps making more movies at least one with bob barker even had a dream about him great
what can i say my favorit actor is the star of movie
2nd only to caddyshack .
adam sandler is hilarious and i loved this movie ! my favorite scenes have to be when he was singing into the intercom that went outside of his apartment wanna kiss you all over old chinese lady came up think funny but then they show him running out next morning she wearing shirt says hey don't want breakfast? gross also sends grandmother a retirement home ben stiller plays man in charge makes grandmother's sew quilts so can sell them!!
this is definately adam sandler's best movie to date . i have wore out vhs copies , and am working on wearing my new dvd of if only could still accomplish great a movie..sighs
your guna die clown!! ! hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
bow to happy!! !
great !
i watched this movie expecting to be bored out of my mind , but surprise could not stop laughing ! preconception the was that wouldn't enjoy watching it because centers around golf (i am a fan) found one most hilarious movies have ever seen...you don't know-it-all like . favorite scene is fist fight between bob barker and happy...it funniest scenes in comedy-movie history ; it's definitely classic anyways real funny starring guy...fun watch over again for some laughs
i resisted watching this movie for so long mostly because of the title . just thought it would be a really dumb unfunny picture but after big daddy was eager to see adam sandler's other movies , finally watched happy gilmore admit wrong ! never judge book by its cover or guess is funny fast-paced and good fun there even hilarious scene with bob barker price right
this is really funy.....beest golf show
i do not like golf or hockey , and i'm a fan of adam sandler . nevertheless still thoroughly enjoyed this movie there were few sexual references although the language was bit harsh think that it says lot about main character (happy gilmore) he did something want to help his family comedy with compoletely deserving my five stars !
i love this movie , it's the best comedy . adam sandler is greatest
this is one of my favourite movies . adam sandler has done a great job with movie i've probably seen million times and it still makes me laugh
adam is the best .
this movie is soo funny ! i could watch it over and again not get tired of . if u havent seen yet , you have to rent it!!!
this is one of adam sandlers greatest yet and always will be to me . every scene remains clear in my mind it still makes laugh even though i'v eseen years ago
lol i am still laughing after just seeing happy gilmore . love this movie all of the jokes were hilarious adam sandler did a great job tries to save his grandma's house and complains that see's old goes joins tour everyone should step right up see if you can outdrive golf club whacker guy
happy gilmore is the best , funniest movie ever made . adam sandler rips and so does bob barker it's one of those movies you can watch a million times still crack up
one of the...if not the best adam sandler movie !
adam is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
one of the best action movies all time . i distinctly remember seeing raiders lost ark in theater hadn't heard anything about it , so had no expectations and movie opened up with that great scene where indiana jones uses his whip then led right into classic tries to steal idol has run through traps while a huge granite ball is rolling behind him first ten minutes ! thinking if were amazing how have entire front me ? rest didn't disappoint story compelling character (perfectly played by harrison ford) extremely well-done exciting manages be funny too i'm guessing almost every adult already seen this but you haven't - what are waiting for
happy gilmore is one of the funniest movies i have ever saw (next to waterboy) . adam sandler and chris tucker should make a movie together it would be very funny
any movie that stars adam sandler is guaranteed to be absolutely histerical . his humor clever and original
i watch this movie whenever need a good laugh . it is so silly ! sympathize with happy's golf frustrations as relatively new golfer and often wish could react the way he does
an excellent film ! all should see it and witness the genius of adam sandler .
this is an awesome movie ! in fact i watched it today and laughed my head off . what a wonderful team matthau lemmon make will miss their work trememdously
does a eiekel ebert 'two didgets up in the general directon of lone...fan , and others who dont like this film was first lemmon matthau i had seen since odd couple they define odd-genre have yet to see anyone do it better.. .
i own it on dvd ! great movie . love helen hunt
i'm sorry , but obsessive compulsive people are funny .
excellent ! acting was great by all , even verdel .
great movie . very funny
i wouldn't have called it a comedy , but loved it.. .
jack nicholson is crude but brilliant . this movie more subtle than knee slapping or gut busting comedies even though you hate jack's character , you've got to love him too helen hunt and greg kinnear are both fantastic as that cute little dog
great movie !
excellent story and stunning character development . jack nicholson , helen hunt greg kinnear cuba gooding jr star in a about relationships love compassion at the end of movie you realize just how much has changed for characters subtly it happened not action/slapstick fans but definitely enjoyable
jack nicholson , a cute dog nice looking helen hunt nicely put together comedy .
great comedy and interesting movie . verdel , the dog was so cute jack nicholson excellent
one of the funniest and best movies i've ever seen . only jack nicholson could have played part melvin , anyone else would not been funny helen hunt is also great some lines in this movie are just hilarious (ex people who talk metaphors ought to shampoo my crotch when he introduces carol simon by saying uh waitress fag ) favorite doesn't like either insane or has no sense humor
great use of misdirection and playing upon assumptions . well acted superbly done
it's jack at his finest ! nobody plays a better jackass too funny for words - must see!!
helen hunt is amazing
best romantic comedie ever ! this is my fav movie of all time , i love it
very funny movie with interesting plots and characters . the cute dog , verdel stole show loved it all
there are jews at my table !
man is this good . i thought it was absolutely great , funny feel-good performances from nicholson and hunt who both deserved their oscars one of the best films '97 (along with l.a confidential guess titanic) only fault found wouldn't believe that she would fall for jack loved atmospehere film see now damn witty too (greg kinnear great!) summary :
extremely well made comedy and a beautiful movie to watch . helen hunt is goddess in this
i never cry . am a grown man who feels it very important to let anybody see him thank god was watching this movie alone at the time have say though that when saw for second not completely logical example , if he could figure out dead end while observing his wife's agony why earlier investigating boy etc. ?
great movie.jack nicholson plays nasty melvin who cannot be nice to others and has terrible insults for almost everyone . he a crush on waitress played by helen hunt his neighbor gay man is an artist attacked put in the hospital forced take care of neighbors dog while hospital.things change from that point grows like becomes nicer person helps out sick son i fact this little makes better could not reach , slowly changes into { perfect but nicer.} loved movie still enjoy watching it
jack nicholson is great , he makes for such a hatable yet lovable guy . good storyline too movie
i think that this is a great movie with jack nicholson playing melvin who nasty man has neighbor gay . helen hunt plays waitress sick son melvins gets put in the hospital because he got beat up bad so to watch after verdel {neighbors dog} and slowly starts change his life around nicer of watching dog
jack did good! ! strong plot and subtlely humorous .
one of the great ones . as a comedy , i'd give it 4 stars b/c to me wasn't hilarious laugh out loud funny but movie in general gets full 5 ! usual nicholson does what he best acts helen hunt just seems so fake and she over dramatize also is cuba gooding jr greg kinnear who play their parts well dog without doubt character whole story he's sooo cute
there's no false-advertising in this title . helen hunt nicholson are superb , but greg kinear steals the show
very well written and acted superbly by jack nicholson , helen hunt cuba gooding jr . greg kinnear directed providing a good flow that helped it remain interesting for how long was
i thought as good it gets was an excellent movie . besides the usual corny , slapstick humor of most comedies this really portrayed characters unique quirky caring individuals loved so much that went out and bought
another well done film with great character development , and acting . shows interesting relationships between characters the filming is excellent entertaining
this movie is great . helen hunt and jack nicholson have chemistry hits all of his lines perfectly it keeps you very entertained
both jack nicholson and helen hunt perform great . the story is realistic to life lots of actual nyc scenes dialogue meaningful little cuba gooding jr also did a good job
hilarious . nicholson does an outstanding job playing obsessive compulsive writer struggling to interact with other people supporting cast also rocks
jack nicholson was hilarious as a fiction writer with multiple mental poblems . he and helen hunt had special chemistry that i haven't seen in long time- despite their age difference when saw it the theater , everybody raved about could feel how much character played by him loved her son
very witty funny . jack nicholson is superb until the end where he goes soft chases waitress dark comedy part of time because what happens to neighbor was cheesy
this is real comedy.. .
i think this one was the best of 1997 . you people who good will hunting and l.a confidential have as much meaning depth must be smoking crack
everyone i know who saw this move loved it . young , old men women nerds jocks..
i laughted almost as much of this film cried forrest gump that doesn't say little ! actually half the time i'm sure is funniest movie i've ever seen , even better than there's something about mary american pie dumb dumber and for people think stinks homofobi : haven't you understand it's ironi ? use in comedy same ellen's last shows only different good it gets funnier but still important gays' civil right . one best gay films made though show me love not a big nicholson-fan must - his [only?] masterpiece both he hunt deserved their oscars huge mistake was to give titanic oscar more touching :-)
i loved this movie the first saw it . had to buy
the dog was best part
i'm sure not the only one with goosebumps first time i saw ending .
second best movie of all time (tied for 2nd with a fish called wanda) , after waiting guffman .
these go to eleven !
the stone henge scene alone is worth watching this movie , it hysterical . shows christopher guest at his best a very funny with lots of cameos
this is a great movie , absolutely hilarious and if you are musician (like me) can relate to at least 1 of the mishaps band encounters . everyone involved did their homework in making mockumentary after i also recommend all need cash which profiles rutles (beatles parody)
it goes to 11 !
still makes me laugh 'til i cry . christopher guest is a comic genius all of his movies are comedy classics
just plain great . makes fun of every mistep made by rock band from the clash mark ii to linda mccartney , and songs really aren't that bad guest's mocumentaries have all been good but none them ever quite matched this one
a true cult classic ! one of the funniest movies all time and certainly cleaverest . it stands up to repeated viewings jokes never wear out without being demeaning , uses endearing characters make skewering social commentary on various aspects rock roll industry
hilarious if you have more than six brain cells . incomprehensible less
this movie used to be great . then , it was released on dvd with commentary from the boys as spinal tap making them all reminisce of better times somehow made
completely original and has spawned a plethera of knockoffs . mckeon makes me howl smell the glove! !
k i don't think it gets much better then this hilarious movie
one of the most brilliant comedies ever . i can't sit throught movie without laughing my ass off this is best documen...i mean rockumentaries theres too many great things in to even begin describe highly recomend that anyone who hasn't seen check it out , a genuine laugh riot
i just noticed that a reviewer with the name callmetootie gave spinal tap one star and called it failed attempt . curious about someone who could make such an ignorant statement of funniest movies i've ever seen , clicked on callmetootie's read some more his/her comments quickly became apparent is complete idiot this person's 1,000+ are polluting rateitall senseless drivel most intelligent sarcastic hilarious past 30 years if like you dislike yet rave tv show judge wapner's animal court do us all favor keep your mouth shut
the finest mockumentary ever made . some idiots didn't realize it was even a joke !
probably my all-time favorite movie (and i've seen a few) . i named scotty nigel christopher guest is genius who does not work often enough waiting for guffman and best in show just make me want more from the guy this blueblood his equally talented tapsters michael mckean particularly harry shearer created tour de force , er rock whatever quintessential mockumentary rockumentary now where's miniature bread ! been working with it half an hour cawn't figure out...look there's little guy.and look who's here.no one here...it's complete catastrophe
the funniest movie ever . a cult classic could watch it again and
i gave it this rating because its the original indiana jones and had some religious super natural aspects .
many of my friends had talked about how great this movie was for a long time . so , year ago i finally rented it and really pissed that taken me to see is definitely one the funniest movies have ever seen more amazing aspects most part wasn't scripted deep in their characters actors came up with lines on spot rob reiner as documentary film maker who follows around interviews band three bandmates are tremendous spinal tap true original
my husband and i watch this parody of a touring heavy metal rock band at least twice year , we think it gets better every time see . with rob reiner narrating the movie seems legitimate start quickly unfolds into absurdity though several hilarious scenes that play off best stereotypes- amplifiers go to 11 drummers die mysterious causes soaring signature guitar solos nigel tufnel so many have us rolling on floor like one airport security checkpoint (you yourself) where is stage dancers dancing around miniature stonehenge (a result measurement misunderstanding) believe or not also features an all-star cast including billy crystal dana carvey fran drescher bruno kirby anjelica huston among others if you haven't seen straight your video store tap america ! won't be disappointed
this is spinal tap was a very clever method of satire .
this is the most hilarious movie ever made about rock roll . they really capture heart and soul of heavy metal in 70s with a humor that even nonmetaloid can relate to
really funny , incredibly creative film . couldn't stop laughing and it gets funnier each time ! definitely worth checking out
i liked this movie . it had a decent plot for funny , which is often rare thing in good comedy
i loved ghostbusters movies.. . lovely
the top grossing film of 1984 , ghostbusters (directed by ivan reitman) was a nice mix child and adult comedy . bill murray dan aykroyd harold ramis ernie hudson are paranormal investigators (or ghostbusters) in new york city quartet capture ghouls ghosts other goblins portable containers keep them permanently secured at office which is held down their secretary (annie potts) until an unbeliever shuts off power releasing carnage back on all this just prelude to big showdown with gozer demon who has taken over building two its tenants murray's love interest played sigourney weaver resident pathetic cpa (rick moranis) what makes work chemistry between as they counter balance each other's personalities moranis perfectly cast well moreover still holds up today do special effects my only complaint that addition felt forced if producers decided halfway through movie add african-american actor bottom line remains funny even after almost 20 years
another bill murray classic ! humor is a mix of slapstick and dialogue . the plot good one , it obvious why two more sequels were made plus well-executed comic spinoffs remaineder cast well-rounded laughs keep coming highly recommended
jesus will not return until this movie is number one on list .
it was a real laugh . my mom and i must have watched thousand times
groundhog day is one of my top ten movies all time(even though list has many more than movies)
this movie is a classic , and should be required viewing for everyone before they die !
overated but awsome movie thrilling and intense
great - i even love the title groundhog day february 2nd is my birthday . pa scenes with little very good acting and an interesting storyline
one of the best time travel movies isn't a star trek at all ! :) groundhog day is hilarious , and same heartwarming comedy starring talented bill murray classy andie mcdowell . murray's meterological character trapped in loop reliving over results vary wildly that's where fun lies crazy kind ensues including my favorite scenes grand theft
tis a very good , inspiring movie . not sure if it's true comedy though
one of the best bill murray is a good actor and harold ramis director
funny , well put together....nice story this is a great movie and it complete .
this movie was freaky . i didn't want to be alone for days ! ahh , still think of it and get freaked out the thing that makes scary is we don't know if could actually happen brillantly done even ending until happend such a twist recommend anyone likes scared
a really good film . in my opinion its not comedy because there are few out and laughs it , except for chris elliott but fantasy where murray has to repeat the same day over again until he becomes better person takes him quite while do that an enjoyable ride watch change little by
this is among bill murray's greatest movies . imagine having to live the same day over and again i wonder how much of was ad-libbed chris elliot has a small role manages be funny just saying thanks for cup coffee ! rare comedy that worth watching
hilarious and original...i love bill murray .
groundhog day is without question of the funniest and most inventive comedy i have ever seen.....brilliant brilliant brillaint!!!! !
callmetootie is an idiot....bill murray hilarious and groundhog day a classic . i want some flajacks too late for breakfast officer ?
so many levels
reluctantly attending the famous traditional forecast-by-groundhog ceremony,cynical weatherman bill murray finds same day keeps repeating itself.as intriguing possibilities,including fresh chances to seduce resistant andie mcdowell , emerge,he must battle through despair towards redemption.comfortably best contemporary comedy (enhanced,for me,by falling on my birthday),this is a warmly romantic,uplifting and gleefully intelligent gem .
this is my fav movie . bill murray's best role i belive his transision from being a stressed out reporter to man at full potential , and in the end he gets girl watch like an addiction of course it on groundhogs day don't drive angery -bill murray
this was so touching that it made me cry . the plot may be fictional but its somehow realtted to our daily experience is about how a man improved his inner self ever since he has been stuck on same day , as learned from mistake became wiser and not make again many recurring days went pass by better
this is bill murray's best movie . one very innvative ; offers something new , the guys waking up and reliving same day over again not exactly hilarious!! ! but it's of those comedies that's better b/c funny in general it has a nice storyline he falls for foxie andie macdowell also chris elliot who always seems to play loser
this is bill murray at hie best absoulutely hilarious .
ha ! loved the storyline . original , creative very funny bill murray is perfect for movie never a dull moment
brilliant ! bill murray is excellent , and such a clever film too
i think that this movie should be displayed more often in t.v. , people may actually change know did .
one of robib williams best films ! too bad a sequel wasn't made
awesome movie . normally , i shy away from bruce willis films because don't really think he's that good however did watch this one and will be the first to say he does an excellent job little boy a great as kid who sees dead people
this movie is very cute , i like that a person can watch it at 10 or 20 .
i love robin williams.. . he is a comedy genius can make me laugh forever !
hilarious , couldn't stop laughing !
this was a true horror movie without all of that stereotypical stuff you see in . haley joel osment truly shined and should've won an oscar , woah ! i wasn't expecting ending like m night shmalyan has made the template thought provoking movies
this movie not only had funny moments (usually i find comedy movies arn't funny) , it also a touching story . very happy ending and showed us the type of love father should have for his children (going through all that just to be with children)
i watch this movie every time it comes on love it! ! never gets old , and hilarious robin williams does a fabulous job as mrs . doubtfire
very funny , amusing ...lovely film and cast
i thought this movie was really good . robin williams does a great job and like how it has point purpose other than just having the cast act idiots whole it's definitely worth seeing
i was laughing the entire time . my ribs hurt so badly , but it worth ! hysterical movie could watch again and
even though this movie is too cute for my tastes , robin williams in top form . i honestly don't think he's topped performance since came out he ad-libs so well here that it feels like part of the script actually saw twice theater and laughed just as hard second time around groundhog day still funniest 90s but one close
robin williams is an overactor , but he does it w/ such great ease . was the ugliest woman that i have ever seen except for patrick swayze  wesley snipes and john leguizamo in to wong foo..
one hell of a funny movie- my absolute favorite all time . when i was little could recite mrs doubtfire's lines from beginning to end whole lot memoriable scenes- including the notorious scene where doubtfire is cooking in kitchen... first day as woman and i'm already getting hot flashes lol this movie definately classic- robin williams hilarious did wonderful job doing drama scenes well it run by fruiting !  great film- deserves be top 10
the best movie ever!! !
robin williams should've won the academy award for his unforgettable and truly delighful performance here . fun !
robin williams was awesome ! the movie has a great message and story . combination of actor endless possibilities
very funny movie! ! robin williams was great in it . he a role perfectly suited for sad and at the same time , movie is rarely like that good happy ending as well to boot cooking scene where mrs doubtfire orders out food after burning her plastic old lady suit funniest
great acting,funny , sad robin williams should have gotten academy award .
the best of series . as close to perfect movies done in neo-american style
raiders of the lost ark is by best trilogy !
my favority comedy of the 80's , golden years . i think line there are two lines that say it all for me first from murray near beginning movie when his girlfriend leaves him and second ramis they being interviewed by army enlistment officer one- "but who will water plants?" - "no we're not homosexual but we willing to try."
this is one of the funniest movies ever made but it has to be seen uncut . plot two guys join army thinking its their best bet for future they are not you typical soldiers and piss di right off military service takes some very funny twists point that end up in a well armored rv harold ramis bill murray great
i love this freaking movie . john candy as dewey oxburger is hysterical
murray again
an absolutely wonderful film . considering it's tight of budget , pretty much fantastic i applaud it most especially haley joel osment's acting thou' there are certain inconcsistensies they try to maintain the reality they're trying present good..
funny movie , bill murray in his finest hour .
its a clasic! !
classic . bill murry's defining movie i could watch it again and , thank god for cable because is always on
little funny parts in it , but i give this one a 5 star becuase its just movie you can watch 3 billion times and still enjoy .
bill murray is arguably the funniesst person of all time .
what an absolute classic . stripes was among the first r rated movies that i saw and one ever taped off of hbo probably wore tape out watched it so much bill murray is incredible really carries movie yet , understated performance by harold ramis which my favorite part definitely better perhaps drags on a little but this still funniest all-time with some most memorable lines john candy judge reinhold laroquette in supporting roles cast great as capper film taught me loofah
with that wonderful twist ending and one of the best juvenile actor performances ever by haley joel osment , this movie ranks as all-time for me .
i am a fan of bill murry . he makes movies that would suck without him strips was funny movie my favorite scene when the squirl at gradutaion
one of the five funniest movies all time , due in some part to great writing but mostly fact that bill murray is hilarious . put anyone else role and you have a movie that's barely above average who could pulled off old yeller speech at end basic training ? best scene has be when sgt hulka them go around introduce themselves.. there was
i was in that company .
i cannot remember laughing so hard from watching a movie in years ! this was truly original romantic comedy . recommend to everyone
excellent movie . my big fat greek wedding is something fresh and original after endless lines of mindless romantic comedies it shows the truth about love , isn't always pretty easy sometimes you have to make comprimises but in end can happen if work at jokes are actually funny characters real lovable acting was terrifically well done especially for a low budget independant meant limited release this highly enjoyable film you're mood cute lighthearted what i would recommend
i think it lived up to all the hype surrounding . was a great movie very funny in parts , and dragged others have some greek friends they assure me that is not far off mark laughs throughout highly enjoyable film
riveting ! this has gotta be my favorite film of all time .
i wasn't expecting much from this movie , but was blown away . my wife drug me to and it absolutely hilarious
a great comedy without foul language and sex scenes . it shows you how even though family can be over bearing influence the way live life break free become who want to marry if they really love care about will learn accept things welcome them into
this movie lived up to the hype . character driven comedy was very funny and overall feel of film charming one best things about it fact that they didn't follow usual romantic plotline these two never broke because a misunderstanding got back together like all those other movies is smart , well put worth watching time or
really cute , funny and clean! ! i absolutely adored it when saw . love this movie
this movie was so funny . i really loved it i've seen 3 or 4 times now , and it's every time go see !
not many movies really make you laugh out loud throughout , but this one sure did . hysterical !
wow , what a surprise . totally entertaining movie not only did it make me wish that i had large family around but made incredibly hungry for greek food pleasure to have an enjoyable loving without special effects and lots of sex four letter words so delightful saw 3 times now own the videotape
the best comedy of year!! ! brilliant very hilarious . casting is great rush out and see it
i have purchased many videos/dvds or my children . this is the first dvd that for myself it was a great movie
this is only partly a cinderella story . what about culture clash , between your typical anglo-american-two-and-a-half-kids family and enormous-invite-the-hundred-cousins ethnic it was brilliant accurate go see
this is such a creepy movie . after you figure everything out at the end , all clues are put together in your mind great job by creators of film
this was an incredibly charming movie . it's nice to see a small production make such big hit i would recommend film people of all likes
i thought this movie was so cute ! it wasn't really what as a chick flick . you kind of know the ending but is incredibly funny although such small production..sometimes smaller movies are best recommend to anyone
an ethnic chick flick , but its group that we don't have many movies about . any married person can see themeselves in this movie.its not hilarious funny and memorable
it's wondeful that small movies like this can become such big hits . one of the best family films i've seen , and cast is funny charming to go along with it
one of the most charming movies to be released in a very long time . cinderella and ugly duckling stories have new treatment this glorious celebration greek culture their lovely families nia vardalos michael constantine shall remembered at oscar time...and i dare say...they will rewarded
it's one of my favoriot movies all time !
eddie murphy is pretty hysterical in any movie he's , this one included . a laugh riot !
eddie murphy ! what more is there to say? ?
eddie murphy's finest hour . judge reinhold and the other guy were very good also comedy , action mystery all wrapped into one
one of my favorite movies all time . the first i saw eddie pretending to be a gay herpes simplex 10 victim get into rich restaurant , literally fell out chair laughing
love it . i especially like serge and sgt taggart
eddie murphy is hilarious in this movie . a classic and everyone should own copy if you don't know the banana tailpipe then have to see
i was fooled till the end . hated it until when finally got awesome movie !
excellent series with eddie murphy is a classic of comedic genius . remains to this day one the best comedy all time
i would consider this an action movie as much a comedy , but either way it is absolutely great and eddie murphy's finest performance . you had to love the axel foley laugh soundtrack vintage 80s unfortunately seemed like murphy lost his edge after wasn't funny again until nutty professor (although bhc2 was pretty good)
best action comedy of all time . eddie needs more these
i'm a big eddie murphy fan , so i think bhc is the best movie of all time .
that rug really tied the room together . one of my favorite comedies , pop it in when you had a bad day
all i have to say is the china man peed on my rug
so far , the most satisfying effort from brothers coen . i usually refrain describing something as "genius" but this picture comes close possible it's a study of mundane bordered by entwined extremes (wildly engaging characters and sordid situations that involve them with plebian calm bowling alley serving familiar center) even when you think straying into inexplicable it kicks back onto rail sends rollicking along next hilarious set-up (how all ties together is borderline-magnificent ; feel if haven't been watching movie much somebody's bad day working itself out) how can anyone recommend that's sleazy (cameos ben gazzara john turturro) sexy (julianna moore tara reid) sweet (a great change-of-pace for steve buscemi) surreal (the cosmic lane/pin girls dream sequence one ages) at same time ? true cinemaphiles are miles ahead review (nodding in rapt appreciation) hungry novices enthusiastically encouraged to purchase dvd prepare best theatrical releases last five years
he helped draft the port huron statement and was a roadie for metallica ! that summed up dude's accomplishments . what great flick
hilarious movie . screw you if dont like it it's one of the funniest movies ever !
the greatest movie ever made .
maybe liking this has something to do with how old you are . personally , i think its hilarious great performances by bridges goodman and buscemi as all coen brothers movies well wittily scripted very funny
i've seen this film a ton . stoner sage of the dude as played by jeff bridges , who is marvelous at his comedic best also superbly written coen brothers only theirs that matches amount quotable lines for me oh brother where art thou lebowksi acted john goodman and steve buscemi people tend to slag comedy but making laugh hard game if sublime dark humor are what you like movie good meg ryan your i'd stay away it really tied room together man
this movie is funnier every time i see it.brilliant performances-especially by john goodman .
easily makes my top 5 funniest movies .
jeff bridges and john good man are hilarious this is one of the funniest movies i seen theres nothing not funny about just way he looks some times especially when sherrif telling him how much a jerk off then gos i'm sorry wasent listening dude abides . all ever wanted was his rug back
great movie to put on at any time . pissed off from a bad day work (or lack of work) ? tired people pissing your rug that really tied the whole room together want learn about pomerainians and pederasts in same make yourself white russian...er caucasian...and watch big lebowski
i think this movie was excellent...although it a thriller type suspense...it very well done...this can keep u on the edge of your seat all way to end ! remember 1st time saw this. . for my birthday with some friends....the whole theatere packed so we had sit floor seats really close picture remeber freaking out at certain parts (being only one in audience screaming..haha)..  : ) read comments above and noticed some1 saying how they neva showed wen bruce willis showered or ate...and on...but mean not every shows that...but come even though didnt show person wasnt eating sleeping showing main purpose movie...ya get me ? neway...every1 should go c movie..its great great!! ending gets thinkin wat ...this such good idea movie...and actors were just fantastic..one best movies have ever seen :o)
this is uummmm.. . like .. a great movie , man.. made me wanna go blowin'. err...bowlin' that is..
julianne moore rules!! !
*giggle* what another fantastic film by the coen brothers ! main characters work really well together and its such a silly plot . my favourite scene has to be where they go around boys house john goodman does his you are entering world of pain then proceeds smash up this nice red sports car owner comes out it is quirky , but worth trying watch
shutup donny .
glad to see this movie rated so high . best and smartest comedy all time ! john goodman's role ever donnie was a good man , bowler...but you took him lord like did many young men before their at lon doc khe sahn hill 354 (all real vietnam battles by the way)
this is the best movie i have seen that will never watch again . was so scared after for weeks had to turn every light on when walked through house living with my mom and her husband walls were pictures of his family , from those old 20's where they farmers didn't smile just a creepy feeling would bump into them.i loved suprise ending no clue until wife dropped wedding band pobably still crying we driving home theatre
i can't get enough of this movie ! it hasn't worn itself out or gotten dull the humor is sharp and characters are just so ridiculous love
this is one funny movie . the characters are so outlandish its a scary thought that they were based on people coen bros actually met hilarious , see it !
i was about 9 years old when this film debuted . it much funnier got older and understood more at , you dont know sex dating being a teenager
this has always been one of my favorite movies ! i love the 80s and molly . some movie is kind annoying , but it a perfect teen
movie with true 80s style . ya gotta luv the
molly ringwald is the queen of 1980's films . she was great in breakfast club , and did well pretty pink sixteen candles a comedy classic among them all her anthony michael hall are so funny together that chinese kid riot
this is one of those movies that i can watch over and again . it's a great movie , especially for teenager not exactly 5 star hilariously funny but more than comedy as in general the best
i wanted to be molly ringwald (samantha in the movie) this movie . oh , and jake he was so cute sophmore girl wins over popular seniors heart as dumps his hot girlfriend for samantha have seen (not exaggerating) approximately 200 times still love it there are many funny parts everyone plays their part perfectly anthoney michael hall matt dillon some big names but then is classic long duck dong brother who says one of best lines movie....'sofa city sweetheart' just thinking about makes me hope that on usa or other tv station weekend
this movie protrays the life and love of a young girl turning sixteen . it is so well done , that even today girls are sure to relate character molly ringwald plays despite her total 80s outfits there great one liners soundtrack screams
classic 80s movie which i love
i've had better.. . i can't even guess how many times watched this movie , and laugh every time probably jim carrey's best definately one of the funniest movies in recent years
i think this is jim's best movie , he pulls of the premise flawlessly . a lawyer that can not lie it unheard even ridiculous but jim does for 24 hours and very funny
one of the funniest movies i think i've ever seen . c'mon , who isn't tickled by idea a lawyer not only can't lie but ask questions which they know will be answered with ? imagine what that would do to our legal system....one jim carrey's better
lol second best movie of jim carrey hahahaha
laughed so much i bought the video
one of.. . if not carrey's best movie the plot itself is phenominal also.. outtakes from any ever you have had pleasure of watching it , i advise do
favorite movie . it never gets old everytime i watch laugh so hard
wow . as soon the movie was at its resolution , i knew it a good end however left me stunned and speechless people who made this couldn't have done any better little boy (what his name?) should definetly appear in more movies believe he is very talented (even than some of actors today) bruce willis's acting speaks for itself he's wonderful always !
really great acting and a wonderful story to it plus will surely give you ton of laughs! ! how can go wrong with jim carrey?? ? not
one of jim carey's best . it mixes his ability to do a decent job acting seriously , with unmatched be absolutely crazy good plot for comedy
with no supporting cast , jim carry carried that movie for 2 hours and it was very funny . hilarious! ! is his best work.... more of the same ....
jim carrey is impressive in this hilarious movie . nice to see do something more than just physical comedy it had all the elements of a great
liar was great . the things they came up with were hilarious it's kind of movie you watch over and laugh every time
i gave it a 5 because jim carrey is ball of laughter . very funny movie
this movie made jim carrey my favorite actor . his hijinx are fantastically funny and amazing is a must own for your video collection as it will always be one of mine! !
this was the funnest movies of all time ! i loved it , and jim carrey did a fantastic job . shows how talented he is!!
easily one if not the funiest movie ive ever seen
i thought rice a roni was the san francisco treat........it , but they want to change their image
ben stillers funniest movie!! ! camron diaz was funny as anything
franks and beans!! !
i really enjoyed this movie !!!! !
oh my god theres something about marry kids and i loved this movie we bought it too they watch over again
too funny for words . total , utter silliness and well worth watching
its so funny ! i loved it when was back in the past. . hilarious
you will get a millions of laughs out this movie !
very few modern horror/suspense movies have the ability to both scare and appeal imagination intellect at same time (yes , a film can require use of your mind still be considered horror movie) . this one grabs you on every level think they did it without dragging through gutter or constant blood bath now that's great good cinema !
very funny ! cameron diaz is great! i wouldn't have liked it as much if she weren't mary! ben stiller really in too .
this movie falls into the -so gross it's funny- category . because from beggining to end it was filled with moments that would shock your average viewer loads of crude humor delight most deranged people not typical love story
i don't know how this movie isn't in the top 10 of list . a very funny film with over-the-top stunts that both surprised and sickened see !
all the praise anthony hopkins got was deserved . he somehow manages to be menacing even though is behind a wall of plexiglass jodie foster very good as ambitious fbi agent , who uses and gets used by devious serial killer
i think this movie is great . it shows many interesting scenes and another laugh always waitning near by
brett fav-ray . the final 5 minutes alone make it worth
a laugh out loud hilarious comedy . it's very twisted movie but everything fits together perfectly this one will be favorate of mine forever
aaaaaahahahahahaha ! this movie is hilarious...this a must see . perfect to watch with your friends or something do not family if you are like 15 years old its very embarresing
very funny movie.i laugh so hard i woke the whole house up . it was late at night , when watched crying laughing
this is the funniest film i have ever seen . type of comedy that has you wondering whether might sprung a hernia brings members your family rushing into room to wonder about commotion as watch it time and again some films think are funny , they genuinely may be but where 'mary' beats every other hands down in amount work preparation perspiration editing re-editing rehersal honing perfecting gone script production all manifests itself on screen pure quality brilliant comic genius three scenes come mind - early bathroom scene police interrogation ben stiller after he picks up hitchhiker matt dillon dog cream there still enough material keep comedic appetite honed guess what ? satisfying gratfiying storyline too music fantastic performances great backdrops spot-on all-in-all makes my british heart jealous no doubts 'real deal'
this movie is a classic . everyone can relate to pining away for someone and sometimes dissing their friends that person
another side splitting comedy . ben stiller kept me rolling with his acting the farelly brothers humor is gross and very funny
this movie is very funny . i laughed through the whole best part when dog dies and he brings it back to life wonderful plot , storyline acting
hilarious! ! the characters are great , and though exagerated you can almost relate . a very funny story with lots of unexpected twists complications
i grew up watching 'the ben stiller show' when it was around , so i'm a bit impartial . combining good looks (diaz) with the comedic stylings of and friends (dillon)this movie is can't miss..
the best of farrelly brothers movies (tho kingpins was surprisingly good too) , because lead characters are so fun to root for . they get points having jonathan richman doing music interludes and extra writing a movie that's got same spirit as richman's great 1983 album sings !
there's something about mary is the funniest movie in history .
this movie is hilarious . it's good fun very creative comedy i recommend it to all !
cameron diaz is so sweet sexy ! amazing movie :o)
funniest movie i've ever seen...i love the build me up buttercup scene
one of the greatest comedies all time . and jamie lee curtis is stunning
been a while since i seen this movie , but do remember it being hilarious .
hannnnnnnds dowdowdowdownnn the ffffffffunnnnniest momomomovvie iiiiiiiii haaaaaave ever seen . good thing i am truly no fan of yorkies....
kkkkken is ccccccoming to kkkkkkkill me
this movie had me rolling in the aisle with laughter .
not only is this movie hilarious , but it was very memorable as well . the whole cast truly deserved oscars for film at time a rare treat comedy lovers worldwide i really wished hollywood could make them good one nowadays..
very funny , well scripted and strong performances all around .
extremely hilarious film . this would go in my top 10 list of the funniest movies all time great four very funny and eccentric characters who try to double cross one another get their hands on some diamonds cast with monty python veterans john cleese michael palin , also stars jamie lee curtis kevin kline won an academy award for his role is a riot as stuttering ken when are screen you won't stop laughing classic comedy
i first watched this movie last summer , and i'm ashamed didn't watch it earlier ! a fish called wanda is one of the %#$# funniest movies i've ever seen was laughing so hard could have passed out kevin kline interrogating michael palin about nietzche (sp?) while shoving chips up palin's nose scooping tank john cleese jumping around tossing his clothes off speaking russian are two most ludicrously funny images put on film .
this was how i sounded when watched movie : hahahahaha hahahahahahahahah ! monty python is great!!! hahahaha you have to see it
this is a hilarious movie and another example of great british comedy . although it more american , contains the same absurd chaos that prevalent in many comedies stars john cleese says all
another all time cult classic . enough dark humor to keep you rolling for hours this movie includes two of the python players your comedy enjoyment
for all you monty python fans out there : john cleese and michael palin , plus jamie lee curtis an oscar-worthy performance by kevin kline makes this movie a two thumbs up .
alot of respect for this film . not the best ever but definetly well written acted and directed i am so glad movie came out we needed a horror that prooves it does require gore,teenagers,nudity or an r rating great what believe to be greatest shocking ending all is fact man responsible pumped slowest blah year , unbreakable now truly unpredictable
the cohen brother masterpiece .
raising arizona (released in 1987) is the coen brothers' sophomore film and considered by many to be their best . movie starts with an extended , philosophically tinged monologue smalltime criminal h.i hi mcdonnough (nicolas cage) on how he meet his ex-cop wife ed (holly hunter) struggles have baby couple read about of local business bigwig nathan sr (trey wilson) has just had quintuplets so they decide that should get a share bounty kidnap one infants hires rough no questions asked hunter leonard smalls (randall tex cobb) track down missing while hi's neighbors (sam mcmurray frances mcdormand) hoodlum friends (john goodman william forsythe) suspicious want for themselves after evading all traps snares set antagonists including hair chase stolen box huggies our heroes ultimately honesty policy i am not fan nicolas cage along cobb made this especially eccentric musings cage's character as progresses bottom line great comedy very cerebral notwithstanding much physical humor
son , you gotta a panty on your head. .
probably one of the funniest movies i have ever seen . nicholas cage and holly hunter are hilarious as quirky couple searching for a toddler to adopt john goodman was very funny small-time crook , too this movie made me laugh out loud
young cohen brothers made good stuff even back in the day .
i laughed so hard cried .
funniest movie of the 80's . best line- when nathan arizona responds to fbi's questioning his stolen infant's pajamas : i dunno ! they had yodas and sh#@ on them
more than a comedy , this is an all-around excellent film . cage and hunter are marvellous as couple who out of desperation take matters into their own though somewhat confused hands could have been dark or jaded but it was handled with such light touch that turns to be positive affirmation love hope
after i saw this movie , started driving by convenience stores that were not on the way home
i'm not sure why this is rated a comedy ; it's more of surreal dream.. . and an expertly designed performed one , at that such perfect work cinematic penmanship.. movie deserves ten stars yes funny but its struggle heart far outweigh laughs must see
this is another of those rare few i can never stop watching again and . it was my introduction to the brilliant nicholas cage i've been a fan ever since very funny , original movie with great cast
rasing arizona gets a 5 not only because it was funny , but also of how bizarre was- crazy sh-t happens . i could almost say this movie is deep
this movie is hilarious . it funny and touching without being sappy the characters are larger-than-life , but still believable contains one of funniest scenes i have seen
adorable , hilarious non-gory coen brothers . if you're looking for a not too violent one of the best bros movie this is cage very endearing in it
this is , without question nicholas cage's best movie . i'm normally not a big fan of holly hunter but even she turned in great performance and john goodman was perfect as delinquent friend raising arizona ranks right up there with fargo one the coen brothers' efforts like rest coen's movies it takes slightly warped sense humor to fully appreciate scene where cage robs convenience store has trouble getting away pampers still makes me laugh
great freaking movie ! everytime i hear hey these blow up into funny shapes at all ? well , no not unless round is tell ya just can't help but laugh . or alright you hayseeds it's a stickup everybody freeze down on the ground (long pause) hayseed : which it young feller want should get mean to say if'n rightly drop and i'm gonna be in motion y'see.. shut ok then
the most original comedy movie i've ever seen . john goodman steals show nicholas cage's best
one of my favorite comedies . cage and hunter were hilarious
hilarious ! i've seen it a few times , and always find just as funny . it's great to see what nicholas cage can really do the coen brothers made their name with this film
what a great movie ! this and fargo show the coen brothers at best ; nicholas cage was never better .
this movie freaked me out big time . i saw it last night for the second and still spooked may not be as observant other people (i was completely shocked by ending) therefore , ignorance is bliss because made much more thrilling agree that a drama slash horror with emotional problems of both cole dr crowe but really thought great psychological thriller well premise plot were developed did jump few times (even time) you also can't deny hayley joel osmet gave an excellent performance
an absolute joy to watch matt damons best ever character , and jay silent bob are at their in this feature i have on vhs it is now unwatchable due the wear tear has endured religious factor beautifully done . could go for hours about movie but wont(no applause needed)
hehe . buddy jesus
at last , a fresh and energetic look christianity ! an outragously funny film that doesn't take itself to seriously . for all you loud mouth christians out there who find this movie blasphemous just read the credits before flick starts they state it is work of fiction not be taken although alot points makes begs alanis morrisette as god piece genius i am big chris rock fan but rufus 13th apostle he terrific semla hayek serandipity muse perfect great asw being offended hell devout atheist even iwas
i loved dogma's plot and the acting all characters were great . kevin smith is a really funny guy
possibly kevin smith's best movie . he finally had the budget and means to do something big camoes are great teh story is pretty good george carlin as a bishop was funny , jay silent bo never fail amuse star of this i think alan rickman his dry performance sarcasm lack patience make whole lot funnier than if wasn't there jasone lee too an attack on religion or at least fickleness orgainzed so wouldn't recommend it people who hold strong views however catholic wasn;'t offended in though very also thought provoking
the guy who came up with premise of movie and directed it is actually a christian - so aryandan get your facts correct before you b***h about something that don't really know anything . i think its very clever film do like main thrust being religion an idea should grow rather than using as weapon against things approve or are frightened sweet does raise lot questions ideas perhaps some people take on board
this movie reminds me of how overly sensitive people are about their belief system . some just need to learn let things go and laugh
wouldn't have casted alanis morrisette as god , some of smith's knowlege the catholic dogma is flawed but still a great movie !
what can i say , like stupid movies .
this movie's special edition dvd -- looking for all the world like a slim , leather-bound bible has place of honor on my shelf next to other classics religious subversity . (includes last temptation christ and mp's life brian ) people can sit there get offended they want by it but beneath *# $ monster cruder jokes general insanity is plethora deep insight into nature religions not just catholicism movie so good that even end credits are with an alanis m song i (the verses seem be those god would use too) list authors inspired work everyone should look further what was trying across
i love this movie , naoi2753om should swallow your soul ! silent bob(kevin smith) almost has a god rateing with me . is among my top ten kevin smith picked target that was well worth it alanis morrisette the best reprensentation of have seen to date ill equipped angels (ben affleck and matt damon) gave great preformance (labr8631om bob spoke twice no ticket thanks on train at end god) please people do homework but belive in -matt damon
dogma had great interpretation of scripture although not all information (character names) was 100% accurate . they should have picked someone else to play god , other characters were a good fit silent bob as usual maybe he could one more line
this movie has everything...laughter , tears screams . it is the on of best movies i have ever seen
this is probably the best movie i've seen all year . dialogue incredibly witty , and their ideas theories on life are interesting make you think only problem : silent bob speaks once but he's so much more powerful when he doesn't
another great movie from the team that brought you clerks . this is a ensemble cast who look like they had fun making any with jay and silent bob can't be all bad of course salma hayek in hurt either
this movie's concept and the ideas it tries to get across are extremely good . really makes viewers question god , religion themselves however is better for mature audience who can be able grasp these concepts
this movie worked on so many levels-very funny , but very touching as well..really got me to thinking about religion and mankind if you will . definitely own one.
let me first say that this is not a horror movie ! even though it categorized as , more like drama with supernatural theme . and many have said before great acting brilliant script of course the ending.. wow yes will withstand test time - just psycho did other movies
hilarious .
tom hanks is able to play a little boy in grownups body and make it believable . i loved his apt he had all the best toys
this movie was more interesting then funny . it had a very story i especially enjoyed watching when younger because that is desire common in children , boys - to become big touching line
a very cute movie with such an awesome message . i really respect tom hanks , and this makes me him even more as actor he truly deserves every award has ever won  ! was probably one of penny marshall's best films director...she is awesome..
the sixth sense was awesome . ending unpredictable and it kinda scary haley joel osmand (i think that's how you spell it) bruce willis are amazing in movie it's one of my favorite movies
the movie that made tom hanks big and he was perfect for role because could bring out child like innocence of adult . boy looked a young there are some great memorable scenes such as dancing on giant keyboards at fao schwarz with robert loggia , way eats baby corn appetizers when invites elizabeth perkins into his loft tells her gets to be top delightful film
i absolutely love tom hanks films and grew up watching them . this is one of my favourites - especially considering he has a childlike charm to him yes it silly film , but who said had be serious ?
this is just a great movie , if you look beyond humor .
a great movie with actors - especially the kid . story is , and sixth sense deserves all of award nominations which it received if you haven't seen yet won't believe ending..
classic old school comedy with tom hanks . one of my favorites all time more a kids' movie but still hilarious
i love the movie big . it's a great story that makes you look at adults in totally different light tom hanks did wonderful job of really making believe he's child an adult's body has lots laughs
there was no doubt in my mind that this a boy man's body ! hanks had part down perfectly , even to the language of 12 year old . piano scene f.a.o schwartz is classic..as suit going home his mom and leaving behind love probably about same age as mother
big is a delightful comedy ! tom hanks actually believable as boy transformed into an adult . the scene where applies for job absolutely hilarious i also love it when he arrives at office party wearing outrageous tuxedo and takes elizabeth perkins back to his apartment sleepover in bunk beds
tom hanks , its a classic !
excellent movie , but probably doesn't belong in the comedy category .
one of the scariest movies that i have seen in a while . it is even more scary because there been people who said this type thing happened to them
learnin' about cuba , havin' some food
update : iamopinionated , you've got it wrong american pie tries to be the updated version of this movie . and unlike america fast times is very funny has a lot more than just phoebe jennifer taking off their clothes gives pretty good look into real life high school student at that time by today;s standards,it does appear outdated but overall still holds up clerks may have surpassed as my favorite comedy yet classic remains close second ---------------------------------------------my all about every scene if you went during can find charecter like someone knew what teen-age boy couldn't relate getting caught in private moment brad did ? book much better with developement clasiic well test
this movie is classic !
it was one of the scariest movies that i've ever seen in years . gets your head , mind and soul makes you think while watch unlike other brainless out there
a cl;assic hilliarous
this is a great movie ! all the main characters are interesting . everyone who watches it can identify with someone in story very funny and almost seems like parody of what high school was really for me
great movie , watch it over and again
a classic . one of my favorite scenes is when the door sean penn s van opens up and they fall out in cloud smoke , although every spicoli scene great did you know this movie was based on book written by cameron crowe guy who wrote screenplay for autobiographical almost famous  ? supposedly spent lot time doing undercover research southern california high school to gather material book/movie
one of the best cheesy 80's movies all time .
i love this movie . i've watched it about three times was really great
this movie is the starter to all slacker movies , daze and confuse suburbian list goes on awesome
a classic ! this movie is so funny , and had many future big stars in it . sean penn great all i have to say that the bagel pants rocked
this is one of the best movies i have ever seen .
filled with naughty innuendos and toilet humor , 'the naked gun : from the files of police squad' is one funnier movies to come out in latter half 20th century . leslie nielsen's bumbling frank drebin harks back memories keystone cops silent film a madcap group actors who provide for hilarious ensemble behind nielsen movie laugh riot can forget part where looks up priscilla presley's skirt while she on ladder says boyishly nice beaver! ? or sequence when bad guy at hot dog factory starts firing uttering ludwig has message you responds don't fire i can't hear what you're trying say! this was hysterical !
i love and collect spoof movies along with the two airplane flicks,the naked gun series are my favorites . just ridiculously hillarious these spawned from police squad tv shows,also starring leslie nielsen (1982)they out on video but hard to get try ebay if you want those gems
the opening urinal scene is a classic !
the best comedy series of movies ever .
one of my all time favorite comedy films- i'll never ever get bored watching this times , and probably watch it 100 more in lifetime . it's just a lot crazy whacky humor that will make you laugh until cry classic leslie nielson's best
one of the greatest actors our time coupled with murder mysteries . add in intellect hannibal lecter and you have a "can't miss" thriller !
i laughed so f* hard
amzaing ! this should have been on the afi's top 100 comidies , and is definatly not credited enough .
why is this movie not at least in the top twenty . every scene makes you laugh once , some require to rewind because were laughing so much missed of jokes shame on all who gave less than four stars
love the whole series . i'm a sucker for this kind of humor
probably the funniest movie i had ever seen . lol !
who doesn't love leslie nielson ?
an all time favorite , which through repetition only gets better and funnier
the sixth sense was best movie that i saw last year . thought story amazing end of completely unexpected on edge my seat throughout
this movie is very funny theres not much i can say about it except that its as hell think was the best of 2004
this movie rocks!!!!1
meet the fockers was a great movie . it kept whole theater , and not just myself laughing for its entirety definitely passed test of comedy which is repeating lines after over
i thought this movie was better than the first ! whole cast great , especially obsessive robert deniro go and see because you wont be disappointed .
even better than the first .
i heard such hype about this film , but it's one of those movies that can withstand the over-hype . it was so intense very scary in parts and stayed with me for days after thought ending clever executed well--i completely surprised really moved
this movie is great the first time you see it . it's not nearly as good after that but i won't ever forget how much whole theater was laughing when saw for
hahahahahahahahahathis is the funniest movie ever i've got a crap on deck that could choke donkey .hahahahahahahahahah . it's kinda sguishy , i'm getting emotional  hahahahahahahah i will call him mini me hahahahahahahha called belgin dip hahahahahahaha zip it chss good hahahahahahahaha hyouto noev hyntay subtitle hahahahahahah about to travel though time bid you ador and he hits wall rolls down hahahahahaha all wanted was fricken rotatable chair hahahahaha want my baby-back-baby-back-baby-back ribs chilis baby-back
i can't stop eating !
this one was funnier than the original . fat bastard hilarious mike myers does a great job at performing as multiple characters
one of the few good scary movies in a while . it wasn't just , but surprisingly well-written little boy gave great performance oscar worthy bruce willis bad either i especially liked plot twist this was not your cliche horror movie
better than the original , which is rare . this movie knocked my socks off when i saw it in theaters one of favorites
i loved this movie , stiller and deniro make a good combination of hilarious things .
hilliarous
mini-me is the sh*t biiaaatttccchhh
this was better than the first one.. . why ? characters yeah some of old jokes but new ones ! great for high school and college guys girl too
i really liked this movie . mike myers did an awesome job ! was sheer brilliance
very funny . one of few sequels that's just about as good the original
oh.....this one was way funnier than the first .
this is such a funny movie!!! ! mike myers great
during this story , the audience focus is on boy and they try to figure out his psychological problem . why can he see dead people all time ? at end of will know what boys' special sense sixth it a very meaningful movie
this movie was so funny ! i can't stop laughing every time see it mini-mi is cute you gotta love dr . evil and scott drop-dead gorgeous one of my favorite movies all
the best freakin movie ever made!! !
best movie!!! ! very shagadelic!! daktari!!!!
this is probably one of the greatest comedies ever ! you have to watch it more than once catch everything , but get all absolutely a riot i honestly laugh at every other scene in movie . mike myers does fantastic job playing austin dr evil and fat bastard mini-me was hilarious addition scott frau number 2 are just as funny heather graham pretty easy on eyes too guess so cool because there many quotable quotes it...two thumbs way up
this is a great movie . i think it was bit better than the first austin powers too there introduction of fat bastard and mini me who are both pretty funny we still have dr evil continuing to make us laugh definitely worth watching
really good screenplay . it should have gotten an award
i love this movie . it is so funny mike myers plays austin powers good , no one could do such a job as he does
extremely funny . similiar to the first one but better , very good characters mike myers is
good summer movie that came out . i laughed alot and liked this move better than the first one
very funny , but raunchy . you will like this movie if understand sex jokes there are a variety of anyway
one of 5 movies i could watch everyday and still laugh . lots dialogue that we used when were in high school funny just because its , sexual innuendos for people who love the perverted comedy mike myers is great all around
this movie was the best of all times . it kept me on my toes whole actors were great and amusing , especially boy
definitely one of the best comedies all time . sure it might be a little overplayed by public but how can you beat mini-me? ?
kevin smith's first movie , budgeted partialy on his mother's credit card . it is filmed in black and white almost giving you the feel that are watching characters a survielance camera dialogue gets little graphic at times but so does real life this for anyone who has ever worked serving public or plans to must i can relate scene where chick standing beside big flashing neon sign with price right front of her eyes asking dante how much? people truly stupid get good sense realism from an only slightly skewed version reality clerks i've been one behind counter trust me
one of the best comedies ever-proving that low budget can kick butt with great writing and acting ! way to go!!
update : classictvfan , there is no gas station invovled . it takes place at the quick stop market appeal lies in true to life workaday reality presents once you have matured and dealt with public any way will see just how realistic funny this movie can be.---------------------------------------- clerks first of five films kevin smith's hilarius view askew askewniverse others are mallrats chasing amy dogma jay silent bob strike back original film shot black white was filmed on location leonardo new jersey very store smith worked save money finance came from various sources includeing mother's borrowed credit card plot follows one day dante randall a clerk his best friend who works rst video next door although he spends more time qucik then own ! subjected being called work off hilarity ensues begins badly discovery that shutters cannot be opened everything goes downhill rant about evils smoking (given by gum saleman increase sales!) crazy customers (including smashes eggs!) harrasment local dope dealers all while trying find straighten out complicated love (his ex-girlfriend (whom still with) getting married current girlfriend bugging him go school) finding close play hockey (on roof!) atending funeral an ex-lover complicates showing up late open hectic surprising amusing i highly recomned
the plot of movie was good . it is a thinking person's has twist at end acting also
the first installment of five from kevin smith's view askew series ( clerks  , mallrats chasing amy dogma and jay silent bob strike back ) though character development is a bit dry (dialog written as if for only one person) dialog itself brilliant hysterical ! definately not young children . movie was shot in black white it's low-budget but it good great introduction to
thank you view askew
kevin smith's first and to date best film from his view askewniverse . the is an incrediblly low budget , black white breakthrough centers on dante who called in work when he not schedueled at local covinenece store takes place over one day we join a cross roads of sorts life along way meet list original bizarre characters jay silent bob make their big screen dabut have been only constant every askew veronica dante's current squeez gives more filatio than mos hardened porn starletts never ending bombardment weirdo customers ranal (my favorite smith character ever written next brody) co-worker door video clerk my opinion funniestand most honest films made funnier hell clerks highly recommended
it seems to me that any one who has ever worked at a crap job some point in their lives , loves this film . kevin smith is by far my favorite writer director he unique and realistic aproach his films keeps simple always manages make while making fun of life the same time clerks opinion best but again first i saw which can person biased
i've seen the movie and it's great . i think so at least really funny , if you ever get chance should check out any kevin smith cuz they're good
clerks is the first of four kevin smith films . it shows a day in life avereage american worker dante and randal are just two guys trying to make living perfect blend realism comedy best comic duo i've ever seen my : jay silent bob epitimy white trash genious , master many things one only people who can stand for extended periods time but let's not forget smith's great way blending other together rick derris body building moron walt flanagan pissed off customer mentioned second film mallrats  i love this movie recommed anyone loves at its
i don't understand how somebody could give this movie less than five stars . oh now remember , it's because john woo didn't direct it
a really scary movie . very different from any other i have seen the acting is good , and characters are interesting
awesome movie kevin smith is great
this movie is unique . it has an artistical approach to humor raw !
one of my all time favorite cult classics . this movie has everything- sex , drugs necrophelia these guys are heroes !
a black and white bombshell . this movie is witty hilarious i don't think any other low budget has ever made me laugh so hard
kevin smith's first effort is full of terrific dialogue that his trademark . the a series includes mallrats , chasing amy and dogma for adults only ; watch them all movie night !
hilarious . t and silent bob's cameos make this movie it is easy to see why they have bigger roles in all subsequent films by these two a comedy classic
the only movie that i have ever watched twice in a row . hysterically funny , and odd
the jerk is a briliant film . with comedy unmatched
steve martin is pure genius in this . one of the best comedies all time
i have a soft spot for steve martin , admit it . this guy is hysterical classic comedy
he hates these cans ! great movie and one of martin's best .
i still love this crazy movie . if you ever need a good laugh , is the one
in this very well written and acted movie , you get emotionally drawn into the script . each moment of horror has meaning other than just for increasing body count enough twists turns to keep entertained when think have it figured out there's more meets eye...literally
the jerk is a classic . first , and greatest idiot movie
the jerk is a classic steve martin comedy movie . i'm sure anyone who has seen it knows at least one of oh-so-many fabulous and funny quotes from if you're looking for great suitable person , two people family i recommend watching i've always been fan myself along with horde others must say that in my opinion on his best films
this movie is definately top 10 comedies ever material ! the cans he's got something against these
i'd have to say that steve martin in his prime was one of the funniest people ever , and jerk is great evidence . from physical comedy discovery rhythm all stupid antics this start finish many lines become classics i find myself using daily life : oh so it's a profit thing ! (after mavin johnson told not feel bad about poor record as weight-guesser) don't want money just stuff (says marie when goes broke) by way i'm glad also medgar evers mentioned how bernadette peters absolutely fell love with her movie wish could pulled on face observe tightness face-skin like got
i was born.. . a poor black child thus begins this brilliant comedy that i've only seen once but definitely believe is one of the funniest ever come across bernadette peters' appearance great and steve martin wonderfully goofy it's hard to pick favorite scene , whether singing tonight you belong me or her song he wrote about thermos all
i did not expect to like this movie (having seen the advertisement on tv which looked hokey) but loved it . thought was gripping , scary and too gross or violent.i would warn that is enough hesitate bring a child of any age
i recently added this movie to by dvd collection and can now sleep easy . is one of my favorite movies all time! ! the story timeless never gets old watch it when am feeling down always picks me up in end billy crystal hysterical , meg ryan beautiful like how we get see them both grow so much through soundtrack die for as well think that men need give a chance they may be able relate women friends?!?
this romantic comedy is famous for one scene , which unfortunate because it a genuinly funny film . meg ryan and billy crystal have certain chemistry that you very rarely find in motion pictures these days was pleasure to watch when first came out has not lost its appeal now
romantic comedies usually don't do a thing for me , but this one is keeper . to call it woody allen-ish comedy an insult he never made any movies good meg ryan especially (and gorgeous) as sally and she has the best scene in whole film anyone who's seen knows exactly what i'm talking about
very nice movie and one of the best love stories ever done .
great movie . i was totally tricked in the end saw clues throughout , but didn't pick up on it that's ! scary especially part where little boy is trapped attic with some kind of monster or something plot cool and kept me my toes through highly recommend
when harry met sally.. . is the perfect romantic comedy meg ryan and billy crystal are terrific in their roles , supporting cast members (bruno kirby carrie fisher) add a lot to show surprisingly enough movie isn't too sappy sentimental even my husband (who's quick use term chick flick ) likes this one there lots of great scenes- like car ride new york meal diner where really enjoys her food year's eve parties i also love scenes especially ones central park because they make city look so attractive since everything about entertaining usually end up watching it once year
the best romantic comedy in recent times . meg ryan looks so good and i still refer to billy crystal's claim that men women can't be friends
good acting ! meg ryan's best film :o)
a classic
this movie continues to be a classic that defines the romantic comedy genre .

sandra bullock should be a teacher.. ! i really didn't think she had it in her . simply due to the fact that she's such pretty lady hate say but was impressed with sandra's fighting abilities this one could certainly well instruct girls latest rendition of charlie's angels  credibility ... producers motion picture aren't treating audience like bunch stupid - gullable nerds...in other words seems we , as an will buy anthing they throw at us thanks miss congenialtiy and umm ....will you bit more careful from now on ......cause you're kewl lookin girl get my drift ?

charles grodin is one of my favorite actors ! this easily his best role .
for me , this isn't really a horror movie more susupense i thought . was so surprised by the ending of which doesn't happen often it pleasing to be like that

sixth sense is my all time favorite horror movie . i watch movies the , so it takes a lot for to make me jump not only made but had crying mom and gripping best friends hand throughout entire from moment guy in bruce willis' bathroom end where haley's character car with his at an accident scene you are petrified fear was scared after that read happy children's books sleep bed sister light on night i've never been think reason such effect because always felt there beings around us times we just can't see them

this is one of the best movies i have ever seen . approached it with caution , because looked like cheesiest flick but turned out to be film had all year ! characters are vibrant and hilarious actors do an excellent job pretty faces round (i instantly fell in love kevin!) some absolutely scenes (the apple pie scene band camp stories pure genius!) really worth watching over again make sure you see uncut version...or missing
absolutely terrific . had me cracking up from begging to end every castmember was excellent and each put their own stamp on the movie modern day porky's/animal house type even character awesome , in my opinion though stiffler really made
it's very cool! ! great!!
this is a really funny movie , i liked it . it's not afraid to take the limits and that one of things which make so
you can't help but find that movie funny . it doesn't matter how old are
american pie is the best comdey in high school this year ! a fantastic movie for young adults and teenagers . although there are some pretty rude bits , other make up it jason biggs main actor great he has future infront of him reason why i give 5 stars because you can relate to well,i see all happening at my but not 3 weeks
creepily engaging . this movie rates near the top of my list in all important catagories storyline was absoulutely phenomenal
this movie is very original and f-ckin' hilarious ! gotta' see it!!
i loved this movie . it's very realistic and enjoyed it a lot
great movie about the teens of today . fits what we feel as key situations that could have happened and how someone would reacted one guy in just cracks me up- jock trash talker showing concern for himself being oblivious to everyone around
if i was in charge of giving out oscar's , would give most them to the sixth sense . like this movie because suspense
absolutely hilarious ! the awkward situations of main characters make you want to laugh and cringe at same time . just don't watch it with your parents
it's sooo funny . it uses a lot of non-actors in performance things are really close to campus life lots conditions that teenagers good for and their parents
this movie is really shocking and funny . it a real life high school portrayal very entertaining amusing
i did not want to see this when it came out in the states over summer , but ended up seeing dublin was there fall . haven't been a comedy cinema long tiem where everyone laughed so loudly as they had such good time just kept getting funnier and doesn't really stand second watching though
the best comedy of year ! don't listen to critics who says it isn't sexy : this film is most i've seen on a long time [probably since out sight] miles more than romantic notting hill many cute girls one boy stars in different about boys sex . it's being virgin what's technic get laid should you say what feel or try play soft ? message obvious at end length preper for real fun go with your parents generation , like celebration other side sunday breaking waves probably also idioterne though i haven't that yet.. :-)
american pie did a good job of summing up how hilarious high school can be . i look at flutes differently now
american pie is definitely the best comedy of 1999 maybe decade . i have never laughed so hard at any movie before in my life
i saw american pie 4 times this summer . it is hilarious totally relates to me my friends
american pie was a brilliantly hilarious movie . it comedically portrays what we all went through in high school
this movie is so funny! ! it presents a different perspective on the issue of teenage sex experience . soundtrack cool too.
great movie ! i love a that keeps you on your toes and have no idea of what is really going to happen
american pie is a classic comedy that any age group can appreciate , not just adolescents
hilarious ! i can't believe how hard laughed .
the funniest movie i have ever seen is american pie . it shows an accurate view of life high school boys
i never laughed at a movie more than american pie .
without a doubt american pie is the best comedy of '90's . it brought back that '80's sense humor like in porky's i loved
funniest movie in a long time .
funniest movie in 1999 !
this movie was great . the plot fantastic little boy did a wonderful job portraying person who could see dead people best part ending and you find out....
if your significant other wants to watch a romantic comedy then by all means 50 first dates . the story is interesting , funny and some what thought provoking cast great as writing date flick
since this movie was billed as a laugh minute sandler flick , it attracted the wrong audience . but it's actually one of my favorite romantic comedies i've seen bunch times and really adorable most definitly chick
this movie is so funny! ! and my good eye .
best movie i've seen this year . the little kid and bruce willis were great actors i think plot was very good it scary , but not too bad one of endings
recently saw this at a friends house . i am not big fan of adam sandler , so wasn't expecting much but was wrong movie is darned entertaining and interesting to watch drew always cute in one she actualy charming it's fresh story highly enjoyable ijr says check it out !
one of my favorite movies.. . love adam and drew together !
i am not an adam sandler fan and saw this movie merely for the sake of drew barrymore , who believe is future country's acting . was so pleased with finding it a very funny touching will give second chance
now this is a true funny movie . i think that it started off rather slow and litte boring but once drew barrymore came into the became alot more exciting of course many people will agree with me penguin was easily best character out there funniest part whole when showed adam sandler alone crying on ship singing beach boys song definetly one those must see movies could watch every day all long made laugh harder than shrek 2 , garfeild dodgeball put together great ending!! !
i throughly enjoyed this movie for its awesome plot and great acting .
this movie was sooo cute . i'm definitely getting it when comes out on dvd had a few funny moments , and i think sweet how adam sandler kept trying because he loved her so much great as usual drew barrymore is rather beautiful in flic all romantic comedy
a greatly enjoyable movie . plenty of moments for those who love adam sandler , and good romantic comedy story don't care as much sandler's brand humor one the more entertaining movies that i have seen in theaters long while
almost as great this is spinal tap and waiting for guffman .
one of the best this ensemble groups work . a mighty wind is better , however i've recommended to lot friends also had dogs all my life and i go dog shows people watch comfort some nervous canines horse see horses showing their asses bunch horse's
i went to dr on vacation , and when my room turned the tv refused face 80 degree temperature until this movie was over .
this movie is a social psycologist's dream ! the acting was terrific , right on target and together with great screenplay you have top-notch . christopher guest brilliant deserved far more attention than it received will become cult classic much like spinal tap monty python movies if about real people your
i thought this movie was hilarious . it's not a film where the jokes are obvious or over top humor is low-key and dry actors all seem to be having good time creating their characters fred willard standout as emcee who knows nothing about dogs dog shows , but loves keep talking anyway laughed while watching
this film is a true gem . it's one of the best quasi-documentary send ups i've ever seen don't let subject matter fool or deter you , see film!! ! dutchvu
i loved this movie , and laughed the entire time . have you ever seen a man with two left feet ? no mean ! it is outrageously funny if want to see other side of most famous american dog show because sexual humor may not bring your mother-in-law...this irreverent makes fun humans dogs alike
all dog lovers can relate and realize how we end up being part of each other's life
unless you're a waiting for guffman fan or spinal tap (both is even better) , at least seen these two films i honestly don't believe you should see best in show . the incredible christopher guest amazing all three and fact that this they only had about 10 pages of script phenomenal improvisational skills cast unbelieveable
i am not usually a fan of thriller movies . especially those slasher ones this one was good anthony hopkins great s hannibal lector psychiatrist who is in jail for murdering people and eating them yet he has brilliant mind about understanding the minds killers there another serial killer on lose kidnaps women skins kills  jodie fosters plays clarice hired to investigate crimes help find she goes maximum security talk with agrees so can be transferred.there are some chillingly frightening scenes movie between , tracking down next we do get see,{ real freak guy}as thrillers go pretty well done
if you see one movie this year , should be it ! for dog lovers and eveyone else is hilariouc strangely touching . there someone everyone to relate in
this is what a romantic comedy should be . excellent standout performances by cher , nicholas cage vincent gardenia and olympia dukakis mousy office manager who falls for an embittered baker has some nice moments as cher's dad i don't usually care comedies but highly enjoyed one because it had brains to
i respectfully disagree with you callmetootie . moonstruck is one of my all time favorite movies like to watch it every once in a while its perfect on rainy saturday afternoons big bowl popcorn opinion both cher and cage are among the best actors ever , even their early days need see raising arizona young talented brilliantly funny nicolas silkwood or mask convincing did enjoy them thought chemistry albeit offbeat was definately there realistic as for looking horrible-- never-- he's not typical hollywood gorgeous leading man type but great-looking manly rugged way that many women find appealing finally must say acting well rest cast suberb everyone believable brooklyn family italian heritage
there is drama , suspense and horror film all in one movie . great acting from the stars especially little boy twisted ending makes something to talk about doesn't drag it viewer aware of world around him\her storyline which diverse for everyone
this movie is so relevant to people as old i am . who can remember the wayne's world phenom and snl has many great lines,a nd mike myers dana carvey are perfect together premise fun some of most memorable lines any nineties soundtrack , too changed way looked at bohemian rhapsody !
one of my favorite movies all time ! i could watch it a million times and still think it's funny wayne garth are just great characters , played beautifully by mike myers dana carvey who two the funniest people on planet
this movie was great because it got me jumping out of my seat with horror ! even when i could tell something bad going to happen , still jumped . if you like movies that scare just enough not cover your eyes the sixth sense is see
great movie .mike is awesome in it .
are any of y'all preachers ? i've got a confession to make . main reason i gave this five was because it features two my favorite songs by all-time rock group ( bohemian rhapsody and another one bites the dust ) but other liked simply an amazing movie ! funny , full heart leaves you with warm feeling like dorkavitch said scene where crazy dudes sing in car is downright hilarious if haven't seen wayne's world 1000% reccomend take care everyone
five stars all the way ! wayne and garth offer a great look into mind of hard rocking youth 80's america . was my hero when i younger this movie is blend comedy even little drama well , maybe not whoever thinks that kids from suburbia are boring you're wrong excellent sha
definetly a classic .
this is one that i can watch over and again . it's cool , hilarious excellent a true kick ass movie!! ! here's to waynes world : schwing
this movie is played out , of course but when it first came was revolutionary and that's what counts . original hella creative the actors-dana carvey mike myers that made excellent comedy
this movie is great ! it has a good concept , and keeps you interested until the end . i had to watch twice get
awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! ! i watch it every weekend . never gets old the cars are awesome , music is and one more thing you cool man(like how) ok
a great movie to watch with your buddies . lot of older men/women i've talked who went high school in the 70's said their days were exactly like this good times....
i love this movie ! own it and watch at least once a week . will never get tired of
great soundtrack ! lines cast!...hello can we say matt in the peach pants!!!!!
funny as all hell . slater is so memorable !
one of my all-time favorite movies ! alright , alright!!!!
the little boy is a great actor . it long film bruce willis did good job , and he gets better with age
this is a freaking wicked movie !
very trippy film , the only one that i know makes 70's look good . immensely injoyed this as it has a witty storyline and definately you laugh cool soundtrack clothes well
loved it , never get tired of watching and hey was filmed right here in texas !
this is such a great movie but then again any thing with ben affleck in it good .
guess what isacc newton , i'm the one smokin' marijuana m***** f***** ! best line i've ever heard in a movie and probably funniest . if you haven't seen this betta
this is a hilarious depiction of the 1970's high school experience . dope filled tale rebellious graduates getting wild on grad nght entertaining
was never a blockbuster , but everybody has seen it . for sure classic at portraying the timeless similarities of highschools everywhere extremely funny and nostalgic
this movie definitely tripped me out . sometimes i can't sleep at night because see scenes from in my head it's just interesting to other perspectives on what happens humans after death
everyone needs to see this movie! ! if you haven't then your stupid
this movie has so many hidden funny lines . i love the part when one of senior girls yells , fry like bacon you freshmen bitches ! there are some big actors in and they all do a great job everyone can relate to it is classic coming age story characters bound have friends that similar take place 70's just adds film favorite mine watch over gets better
any high school senior will appreciate this flick . it seems everyone in movie relates to someone you know or knew a must see with friends , the more better don't forget your wood-shop projects...
i love this movie becuase everytime watch it , place me adn my friends into their characters just laugh we've all been there...yes we have
absolutely brilliant from start to finish . wonderful performances wilder , mostel and the guy who years later was on awful mr belvedere show he played a pretentious gay director hilarious lines great original idea in first place one of mel brooks' best for me song that offbeat wacky almost forgotten comedian dick shawn sings about flowers is priceless "the power a.. sweet flower!"he as both forgetful hippie with warholesque campbell's soup can around his neck also playing jive talking hipster hitler kenneth mars crazed nazi playwright awesome too true gem
funniest movie ever made !
if you see gene wilder's name on a movie , can bet are about to be entertained . while not great actor he is good at delivering laugh and this no exception one would think that with song called springtime for hitler wpould unwatchable but mostel wilder make it worthwhile ijr says check oout !
a very funny movie . it is one of those movies that sounds so weird and bad when you try describe but give lot entertainment down on his luck producer accountant figure they could make more money off flop than success set out to produce the worst play ever find in called springtime for hitlerthey have meet with playwright , director cast has oddball characters then just think succeed making get huge surprise.it won't spoiler this i heard about thought would be ended up finding zero mostel gene wilder are both good their roles
mel brooks' best--by far ! great characters , story superb acting throughout . and while i'm at it brooks has this habit of using very childish lines in an effort to get a laugh movie none that is classic hasn't even approached level quality since
great plot and good special effects . the acting was very dramatic a script ending best part of movie creative
lol don't be stupid , a smarty come and join the nazis party . hippie hitler some funny sh*t
hilarious ! any mel brooks movie is definitely a keeper and who could forget that old campfire favorite , springtime for hitler ey ? *wink* ok gene wilder did good job as well but i think we all know the true genious behind this film .
hilarious ! gene wilder was great , and one of my favourite scenes ever is dick shawn's psychedelic audition . i haven't seen the broadway show yet or heard much about it but this movie's definitely worth renting it's springtime for hitler germany..
this is the funniest movie ever ! my friends and i have so many inside jokes from it .
i saw this straight , and still laughed !
this is a classic . cheech and chong were one of kind
honestly , it's the only stoner movie that i can stand .
i thought it was a very funny movie and cheech chong are hilarious they also had better ones coming .
the entire movie kept me at edge of my seat . acting was oustanding and plot also great i ended up seeing whole several times liked comedy that added in
a side splitting movie !
the truck made out of mary jane and cop getting munchies . too funny
the funniest movie i have ever seen !
muf dvr (from the movie.. . anyone know what it is?) answer : license plate
great movie while smoking pot , you can really relate to it when smoked out . cheech and chong are so funny in this one almost seems like they stoned played off well
cheech and chong's best movie ever !
pretty damn funny . even my parents howled with laughter at this movie , and they are straight arrows
this is the best psychological thriller ever made . it has a great sequence of events and good actors
a movie about getting high on marijuana . very , funny with cheech chong they smoke so much you think you're as are would definitely see again
back in what i now call my stoner days 'up smoke' was a favorite . have seen this movie so many times but for some odd reason hard time remembering it remember of , is that really funny about the wonders pot cheech and chong protray stereotypical perfectly even better if you are on their level when watch
hilarious ! cheech and chong's best movie . they're amazingly funny in their use of pot humor
if you need a good laugh watch this movie! !
funny!! !
two words ; fantastic movie
great title to the movie , sounds like a porno . but seriously was fantastic i think brad pitt is one of most talented actor his generation starts off kinda slow.. just hang in there
top rate - you like dags ?
this film had an unexpected ending . the kid actor was great i like supernatural movies , and technical side of filming good
ahhh , yes this was funny and dark . a perfect combo
i loved every minute of this film.it was entertaining from beginning to end . the acting well done and characters were hilarious memorable only gripe had with film that there some stuff in movie already used lock , stock two smoking barrels other than it is a fantastic that's worth watching again
i liked this movie ! different type of , very enegetic love brad pitt's charicter funny . the ending is great
great film . pitt really delivers a bit much of the ritchie trademark back-and-forth you're stupid no , you are type dialogue- i got enough that in 'lock stock...' but this was better full surprises attitude violence (the key to any movie) and twists must see real thrill ride shades 'the sting' 'rocky' with dash french connection'
this movie isnt for everyone,but if you enjoy weird english humor and pikie accents , then youll flick by guy ritchie . definently top ten material
this is a great movie . it was good all around brick top , turkish and the pikeys were my personal favorite i recomend that you should go see watch over
i read the name and was in love (ha ha) . charecters were developed a very unique way , with narration helping this development almost took part where dog is told not to snatch personally because saw myself jumpin on band wagon snatching it up movie seriously wanted watch again want be like any of that why liked are associated bullet tooth tony most he bad ass got job done or so we wre made think from story about him taking 6 bullets had his doing things worked avi did would also hire man black men added some comedy brit top (the nemisis) perfect villen enjoyed seent get taken out brad pitt pikers need say more ! now take trip england anybody know how antwerp ?
awesome ! it is a dark comedy that rocks . who wouldn't love movie with an dog and desert eagle 5.0s?
this movie was very good because it like a mystery . made you want to watch over and again great acting
this movie definitely makes my a list . i found it thoroughly entertaining , and hilariously funny have heard said that contributed nothing new was not already hashed over in lock stock two loaded barrels differ to be terrific finishing of stock.. if you are the mood for some fine humor with little gore good deal bad language would pick place same category as pulp fiction which also highly enjoyable
one of my all time favourite action/comedy films.there were good one-liners and hilarious characters.not character stole the show.neat camera work soundtrack .
i enjoyed this movie , it was like a rollercoaster ride full of expected unexpected things brad funny cried laughing . go see snatch
this movie rocks!!! ! it is awesome a must go see for everyone . i love funny and witty guy richie , want to do him
this is a really great movie.. . all actors played awesome parts.. i loved the ending!! ! movie will definitely see again over and , then when it comes out on video.. i'll be first in line at best buy!!
the dark humor , script action acting and dialogue were all five star . kudos to guy ritchie !
this movie is an lol comedy !
very flamboyant , and unlike the real world that most gay people live in . however robin williams nathan lane did such outstanding jobs their characters it made movie one of best comedies year i almost fell out my seat at theatre everytime hit screen as albert...he was so hilarious you couldn't help but like his character no matter how whiny extremely dramatic he got even enjoyed gene hackman conservative father this will be a classic someday must have for die-hard fans on final note- nice seeing couple portrayed life long partners who love each other bad gets...excellent !! !
robin williams is hilariuos
i just saw this movie and loved it . watched the tape about four times in one weekend recommend to anyone who wants see a genuinely good
birdcage is great
when you read the plot and what movie is about , it sounds completely stupid . but if your patient enough give a chance you'll find out that very funny sigourney weaver extremely beautiful in this ( which probably reason i really liked movie) tim allen's acting was well done
i found this movie hysterical on many levels . loved the beginning , which pokes fun at star trek people (if you've read any of biographies you'll know that that's pretty much how shatner was afterword) guy makes work being figurative red-shirts from : original series you them their lines went something like captain think i've aaaaaahhhhhh!!! ! red not a good color show
i absolutely loved this film ! how they went from a trekker spoof to actually becoming the characters played . my favorite is alan rickman , dr lazarus
this movie was really good , especially if you like suspense . it wasn't too scary that i had to close my eyes but did jump a lot liked the twist at end-how everything pieces together and find out that..
the best star trek movie ever .
excellent movie-entertaining , suspenseful exciting scary . the actors were great especially little boy you have to pay close attention details ending is with a twist
anyone who has ever been exposed to fandom communities and their attendant discourse can see how easily this hits the nail on head . an excellent companion piece recent documentary , trekkies
galaxy quest was a superb movie . it not only paradied startek , but also the culture created (convention nearby die-hard fans) i loved extra guy who thought he would die like redshirt dies first
why couldn't they get shatner ?
hilarious ! you will be surprised don't know why this movie didn't do better at the box office , it's a constant howler intelligent and totally goofy same time . actor from tv show just shoot me absolutely killed really must-see comedy
you just know they're making fun of star trek fans , but even being a trekker myself i loved this movie . the laughs don't stop! !
funny however , liar is my favorite . this movie sack- religious
greatest movie of jim carrey ! i loved this one . it teached a lesson had me laughing for days
one odd movie , but i like the part with parting of red soup !
as with 'liar , liar' i roared laughter
jim carrey was hilarious like usual , and the story suitable for everybody to enjoy . one of best comedies all ages come out in past few years
one of the best movies i've seen in a long time . acting was really good
i really liked this movie . it was funny but actually had a good , deep point with too jim carey is great and he shows off his talents in one
the best part of this movie , i think was morgan freeman's character . it's nice to see such a 'serious' actor take on an amusing role three main characters (carrey aniston freeman) all work well together is sappy at times but funny parts balance that stuff for dvd owners outtakes are by far funniest i've seen
jim carrey does it again ! hysterical , witty and not get boring one of my favorites
this was an excellent movie !
it actually had a message , and was good one . way
great movie .
it was soooo funny i saw the first day came out and then two days later !
funny , . jim carrey is the best
i still can't sleep well at night .
a really great/funny movie . one of jim carrey's best i highly recommend it
laughed hard
i definatly enjoyed this movie . it was a hilarious carry had many well thought out jokes that mad the audiance laugh load know would see again every person talked to has seen alot jim plays comic , but not stupid roll makes you jennifer aniston also good and she helps along think all true fans enjoy one even if your its really
this is probably one of the best supernatural thrillers (horrormovies) i've seen in a very long time ! sixt sense scary at some moments and i have to tell , it keeps me talking about even month after i'd . asked lot questions different people things that happened movie didn't quite get almost all my been answered satisfactorily can now say great film see how was going end because you could figured ending out were subtle exacuted joel has an oscar nomination for his performance as well pretty original script furthermore stylishly made
i love this movie !
i'll have a bloody mary , steak sandwich and ...a
go to your local video store , select this movie and charge it the underhill account  .
a good movie to see over and !
hysterically funny . the dead pan humor of chevy chase , whether it be as dr rosenrosen... or charging lavish lunches to underhill account explaining through false teeth an airplane mechanic that these days it's all ballbearings - if you've never seen this movie go rent
it pains me to say because chevy chase has become a homorless jerk , but this is one very funny movie . no more quoted
woody allen's best . made even funnier when allen ditched the academy awards to play clarinet in a greenwich village club
i just happened on annie hall last night . it's been a long time since i've seen it and each do find more incredibly funny wry lines from woody allen is genuis with lot of his movies , but this has to be one the best
woody's best ever , and he's done a lot of great films .
i don't know why this isn't in the classics . first time watched thought it was absolutely hilarious ! woody allen writes greatest one-liners , and diane keaton is great as annie hall herself consider possibly allen's best film even if has a simple story it's still an absolute classic summary : one of funniest films ever
fav woody allen film . unfortunately he's made over again a couple of times since
this movie was very interesting , i had to use a lot of my thinking .
woody is the greatest
amazing .
woody allen is hilarious , and not only does every scene of this movie make you think wow i thought was the one who got that ! but some scenes are pretty darn amusing both due to great writing his ingenious acting .
this is a great romantic movie . woody allen at his best annie hall funny everytime you watch it
gunga , la
everyone is forgetting how good charles demarr was . pure genius
the best movie of all time ! period
2 dollars
i want my $2 !
this movie had an unexpecting ending and many suspenseful parts . the plot sometimes seem skeptical hard to disprove
this is my favorite movie of all time . i recommend it to everyone when was a kid , watched and tried emulate john cusack
john cusack stars in this wonderful teen comedy.cusack is dumped by his girl for archrival and decides to kill himself.hilarity results.the paperboy chases are kickass . the same director savage steve holland also directed one crazy summer with an early appearance demi moore.it has several of actors as slightly different people both highly recommended
i love this movie ! a great teen film about and skiing trying to kill yourself .
definately a different type of comedy.. . and certainly john cusack at his best ! this movie is so hilariously funny as others have said , extremely quotable i'm girl i loved women don't assume boys only it may silly humor that men would normally like better than but it's also got its romance in there too
cusack at his best ! this movie should be in the top 5 hands down . it is a different type of comedy but that's what makes so outstanding if you walk up to anybody who has seen and declare two dollars , i want my are guaranteed laugh along with howard cosell wannabe race car drivers loveable french girl all grandmother dropped acid highjacked school bus full penguins dammit brilliant!
i love this movie as cheesy it is , john cusack the best .
i loved the 6th sense . it wasn't bloody which liked is a movie that makes you think , and when credits roll remain thinking about
i peed myself.. .
i rented this on dvd recently . it had been years since i'd seen we roared through most of it.. paul newman gave a great tongue-in-cheek performance one the benefits format is special features cool thing that learned was film based real-life carlson brothers...hockey maniacs two three "hanson brothers" in were jeff and steve carlson...the guys who inspired want laugh ? "slap shot" sleeper comedies all time
i am going to rent this tonight  . havent seen in a few years !
this should be way higher.. . the hanson brothers are timeless
one of the best sports movies ever . funny and unsentimental major league borrowed from this like crazy
one of the funniest movies ever ; along with scenes (fat guy in a little coat) .
this is the best comedy and an ode to chris farley .
very funny movie . a success to spade and farley
the story of a rich frat boy who needs to help save family auto parts business from being bought after his father dies . it's chris farley and david spade at their best (if you find lame slapstick humor funny) for anyone who's ever worked in sales especially funny
fat guy in a little coat that is very funny movies with one of my favorite actors david spade every thing him farley to .
one of the funniest movie all time .
this movie is a classic . it's ashamed that chris farley died though
i think farley was one of the funniest guys in world and this film proves it . best ones always die too soon..
chris farley at his best . i swear that and spade's chemistry equates of steve martin john candy in planes , trains automobiles  this movie really was hilarious has some scenes will never forget (i.e when he's giving the demonstration with businessman's model cars) th deer scene also not to mention cow-tipping a very funny ! rip
absolutely hilarious . melted globs of chocolate under the dash ; that oughtta really up resale value they're covered in a thin candy shell surprised you didn't know hahaha
hilliarous
i could watch this movie over and never get bored . love chris farley!! !
you have to look at the overall effect of this movie on american culture . people would not go in water when came out they were that scared ! great , characters a first class effort by spielberg
callmetootie is an idiot...ive read too many of her opinions and havent agreed with one . chris farley amazing in this movie if you cant enjoy it then i really think there something wrong david spade great his role necessary to be the straight man , but he also has ability dish out one-liners
this should be at the top of list for funny !
chris farley's best may he rest in peace . and those up there who voted less than 5 have mental problems
this is my favorite movie of all time . always puts me in a wonderful mood
the funniest movie i've ever seen . spade and farley's best , it's a shame farley has passed on must see
great drama , effects . story was well told.....
i'm a huge fan of this movie (not physically like chris farley , but you know what i mean right?) . there's 15 minute stretch in the middle it winding up with farley/spade crying while singing along to superstar (by carpenters) which is as good any comedy can think will definitely be missed
to add on a couple more great parts....when tommy is being darth vadar into the fan...'luke , i am your father'...and when he gets hit with board 'it doesn't hurt here or but right here' . what about part meets his new step brother and says 'brothers don't shake hands brothers got hug.' goes cow tipping falls then at gas station dancing around singing 'i'm maniac floor dancing...' this movie so it my favorite comedy tied dumb dumber you can watch these two movies over sad had die same time as crazy was couldn't have made too far
people , what is going on here? ! at the time of this message tommy boy last list! you can't imagine how sad makes me never as i was casually scrolling down page did expect to see . boy...last in line (head say that) looking for cable guy thinking a lot think that dark comedy and therefore half expected it be end but uh terrible let's just recap few scenes here shall we ? hear niner there richard (d spade) asking about phone number he called when loses during sales meeting smashes guys toy cars spade says they're leaving guy..might not call us or motel room whose your favorite little rascal alfalfa spanky?...sinner deer scene fat coat side road fight then restaurant hey mark my face nope are sure cause really hurts right along nothing great movie loss farley dying all again anyone him long
one of the funniest movies 90's . farley/spade tandem was unmatched there are so many memorable lines and great scenes chris farley's death certainly a tragedy , but he will live forever through this movie
good special effects for its day . the score is priceless , and recognizable anywhere
good movie
a classic !
this movie scared generations of kids out the water . great flick
i am not the biggest fan of romantic comedies but pretty woman is quite simply wonderfull . it has a terrific cast( richard gere and julia roberts are acting team made in heaven) , great script,brilliant direction from garry marshall one best finales ever to any movie ever.... love this film bits...
i would'nt call this movie a comedy , but great drama . julia roberts was just amazing
feeling a bit bored today , so watched my vid of pretty woman . dad sat all the way through it and pulled apart saying was obvious plot too full clues okay i said to him maybe is but thats exactly what wanted didn't want have think wonder how going turn out watch film where both characters are likeable boy meets girl you remember (if only for second before realise its just film) that fairy tales do come true
i love this movie ! its my all time favorite brings two people who are so different yet alike in many ways . has to be the best that mind ever been made and julia roberts richard gere should get married but of course thats only movies
no wonder this film sweeped the board at oscars . hopkins is fantastic in his stone cold stare chilling itself hopkins/foster partnership gripping excellent plot and well written other lambs prequel sequels haven't quite cut it for me will have it's place top of all time greats forever
it was a different topic . even though had almost the same ending as most movies , showed how two opposite people can be also gives hope that if you do have tough life change
i will never forget watching pretty woman ! it was the first time learned what a condom . my dad told me mini-raincoat
pretty woman was a great movie- needs sequel . the movie ended too soon , as there should have been romance after he got her from balcony
nothing can compare . the all time classic
best movie of all time in this genre . j roberts + r gere = couple
great actors story...can't go wrong !
best movie ever! !
classic 80s movie which i love
one of my favorite jack black movies (next to saving silverman- highly recommend this movie others who rated 3 or above) . good music , funny lines and is hilarious as always
one of my new favorite movies . jack black is great in it , but the kids that make movie
a great movie that could be enjoyed by both adults and children still remain funny . jack black is
funny badass movie
this movie was great , nuff said .
obviously since this is a mainstream family movie i was skeptical about jack blacks ability to be entertaining without black swearing like drunk sailor communicate his disillusionment with the establishment . however , one wonders where does authority (or as puts it man) begin ? in school of course so therefore who better teach bunch impressionable youngsters question hegemony man then keen wildly instill sense rebellion he turns class into fully fledged rock band always pretty much plays himself but sensitive tinge when consoles various and roll acolytes they doubt themselves me more than just feel-good comedy stadium twist (which it's good at) modern day parable how children adults alike have forgotten their dreams fun even rebel (this shown flamboyant wild metal bands old which touts are unknown repressed by adults) film cleverly analogous rockers purpose (his students suggest point score chicks or get loaded) curiously embodies true spirit most music videos ever could that shows characters able once again forget inhibitions express ultimately stick because my friends what all
i reluctantly went to this movie not expecting much , but couldn't help laugh over and ! jack black is hilarious with those kids . the has a new fresh plot that hasnt been used definatley worth seeing..
this was a really awesome movie , and for some reason that suprising to me . i always thought jack black funny loved all his movies but they were despised by critics when heard about sounds great too bad the will hate it suprised picked up my entertainment weekly saw an then more a's couldn't believe said myself have see ! did wow one of favorites year what good family film despite its pg-13 rating be sure check out if you get chance not disappointed
this show is great ! remember when the nose got flattened ?
funny . this movie is a must see !
classic sketches . humor that can often be pretty crude , but cleverly ironic the way boarding school boys act utterly disinterested during ott sex education scene is priceless ! lots of clever parodies concerning nuances english and american culture as well
i'd have to disagree with some posts here--i absolutely loved this movie . it's one of monty python's cruder movies , and should be for adult audiences only since it goes (graphically) into topics such as sex forewarned that is quite different from the other python but that's not necessarily a bad thing
the funniest movie ever . it is a holiday classic at our house
surely the best movie of wild bunch called monthy python . not as simple most their movies (wich i love too) but much more complex and intelligent incredible imagination visual invention (i terry gilliam s movies) mixed with great performances in a real master piece that you won t be able to forget your entire life
i have watched this funny film multiple times . it's got to be my favorite full-length comedy movie it was filmed in san francisco around 1973 think nonstop silliness !
one of the few movies that deserves a five . it is very enteranining and trippy story without happy ending(for once) for main character recommended
this movie freaked me out as a kid . the music by john williams really adds to mood it makes more suspenseful since shark isn't shown until 1 hr 20 min into ! speilberg did excellent directing and scheider , dreyfull shaw helped make classic film that will be viewed for many generations
this movie was fun and interesting . the idea great strange a little disturbing i loved john cusack in , malkovich too i'd recommend to anyone who wants see something different...but satisfying
if you ever see one movie (which i hope never happens to you) bjm . it has be the smartest and funniest only use all letters from a-o in its title
funny as hell . a great sophisticated comedy actors did job and john malkovich has to be flattered
my all time favourite movie !
this is the most bizzare and confusing movie i've seen in my life . great story , acting (by malkovich cusac) appearance of charlie sheen was terrific thumbs up
at first i wasn't even sure why liked this movie . it didn't have any moral journey that could see , except for maybe maxine's but such a weird was refreshingly unique and got my mental wheels spinning the characters were so well written - they all had endearing qualities as tragic flaws thought lack of an explanation portal would deter opinion fun imaginitve ride without being too dark or cheesey did seem to give sympathy-provoking light same-sex intimacy though then only scene never fails make me laugh is when fan approaches malkovich ironically says how much he appreciates retards portrayed compassionately on big screen 
this was a very well thought out movie , and goes down as one of the best i have ever seen . john malkovich plays great role cusak camron diaz story about an puppetier that finds work filing person discovers portal into head actor being someone else is deffintly theme in more ways than by seeing flick you will understand what mean deffinitly moves onto my all time top ten list must see !
this is a film that i had to watch more than once take it in . unique storyline and superb acting john malkovitch fantastic as cusack cameron diaz they work together extremely well made will be cult most probably studied by students i'm glad own
this was by far one of the best movies ever made . spike jonze is smartest men alive to take on movie number one.. john malkovich actors our time how crazy it have idea go inside his head two.. that they had cusack (a regular guy off street) as a puppet master word originality i could about good for day but there not enough space me write much love garunteed classic fits into every category at least scene or another must see
being john malkovich can be described in one word - genius . the bizzare plot around which film revolves , (a down and out puppeteer discovers a gateway into mind of actor malkovich) could so easily have been handled wrong way but first time movie director spike jones' direction is next to flawless his background as commercial useful shifts gear from subtle sublime blatant lot cast well chosen with cusack playing whos life irreversably change by discovery character provides good anchor for he infact least eccentric cameron diaz also proves decisivly this picture that she act without use her looks sporting wig would not look place lying on motorway bleeding star show eccelent my opinion vastly underrated acts himself truly believable very clever acting when 'possesed.' scene where enters own portal it funniest scenes i ever seen any all story odd brilliant superb inspired end result spectacular buy real watch again
wow , this movie was a breath of fresh air ! the original plot (a puppeteer discovers portal that leads into john malkovich's brain) takes you on wild ride reminiscent twilight zone . there are surprises at every turn and show is filled with incredibly strange situations bizarre humor well-cast too cusack as dissatisfied impulsive cameron diaz his dippy confused wife (diaz shed her glamour girl image so effectively i didn't even recognize until read credits.) gets off to great start never slows down not once did look clock during if you're in mood for mind-expanding creative being malkovich choice
most original thing , i've seen in awhile .
the funniest , most original movie of last ten or so years .
this movie is hilarious . i just rented it last night , and exceeded my very high expectations how often do you see combination of a truly original idea great acting directing ? definitely give points to john malkovich the actor for agreeing unusual that trip through his subconscious was one favorite parts takes an with sense humor go along even charlie sheen gets mocking himself in brief appearances as s friend cusak has started getting on nerves recently but he does job too tormented puppeteer who suffers from unrequited love be warned - isn t everyone if re looking standard by-the-numbers action comedy or drama look somewhere else mood something different strange rental being quirky twisted entertaining
i thought this movie was intelligent , funny and highly recommend it . the story completely original when went to theater see had no idea what expect didn't even know who john malkovich until saw his face left shocked at ended up being about great a bizarre doubt but in provoking way don't how anyone can say that there is poor acting did you recognize cameron diaz ? think she took role though wasn't playing beauty queen whole blew me away
one of the quirkiest movies ! awesome story and good to see diaz in a different role , ie not some ditzy blonde who gets all guys john malkovich was great loved scenes inside malkovich's subconscious!
a great film all around . when the started i was wondering what would happen if malkovich went into his own portal didnt think it but he did scene after is amazing as in subconcious an instant classic , one of my favorites must see for anyone who looking something different ending awesome wont spoil hasnt seen no doubt that this 5 out
one of the all-time greats . fact that you can't see shark until second half (which was originally unintentional according to spielberg) makes it even more effective personally i think it's his best film
it was an experience to watch this movie . i recommend anyone who wants see something that is creative and different
recently , i've become skeptical of the quirky and daring films that make movie critics swoon (like american beauty) which are so often just predictable pretentious . but here's a wonderful exception : being john malkovich is huge joyride almost every scene 100% bizarre humor mostly really subtle as over-the-top whole concept there's nothing gratuitous (the way any tarantino's imitators would have it) excellent acting funny script perfectly directed by spike jonez
a great film . it explores ideas of sexuality and celeberity in fun light-hearted way john malkovich's capacity for weirdness is used to puppeteering effect cusak always , here as loser tortured by unequated love cameron diaz almost unrecognizable but the sweetness her character shines through ending brilliant
this movie was great . the idea that there a half floor and portal for these people into man's head dialogue wonderful john cusak
one of the most twisted , funny movies out there this film shows off talent director spike jonze in so many ways . first scene grabs you and question how silly movie is just when think it can't get anymore outrageous next blows your seat with squeals delight
this is the best movie i've seen in a while . it was very entertaining because humorous corny kind of way i loved it's entire aspect and trippy addition , had an idea to film where camera person star flick did that for couple scenes great !
this was the most creative plot i've seen made into a move in long while . based on far out concept , movie will entertain you during its whole duration and even after when find your mind wondering off to thinking about if you're for fun well acted written flick is must see
as a thriller , the silence of lambs certainly serves its purpose . fine script with solid cast hopkins gave an especially chilling performance evil but brilliant dr hannibal lector overall film managed to keep my attention and never seemed slow down five-star
a summer must-see classic ! even thoug i've seen about two-dozen times (at least) there are still scenes i love to see (the shark coming out of the water while sheriff tosses blood & guts overboard) . this will always be and though special effects today might enhance visuals , it would probably ruin
fun , quirky and original . great movie
different kind of movie . really interesting i think it molds psychological ideas in
one of the funniest movies i've ever seen . easily best movie season thus far
this movie is definately in my top 10...if not 5 greatest movies of all time . never has a made me laugh , and cry so much reminds america the late 80's early 90's it totally underrated winona ryder christian slater even shannen doughtery gave oscar worthy performances but were barely mentioned at i highly recommend to anyone who digs dark comedy you might be pleasantly surprised
definetly one of my all time favorites . wickedly funny , and so very too
see this one and avoid 3 4 .
what a fabulous piece of the 80's . this movie is disturbing and over top , christian slater couldn't be any sleezier i just really like it can't exactly say why because it's good guess
i remember this being a killer movie . the topic of suicide is serious one ; like how they dealt with it christian slater was good here , in pump up volume
this has such excellent writing , i'd definitely consider it among the very best movies of 1980s . though last 20 minutes are pretty lame large majority is wonderfully great i'm actually not a big fan dark comedies but one gets me every time (i also like allusions to late rock band replacements -- westerberg high and color impressed i remember seeing some interview with winona saying that she used band's sixteen blue get into character for film.)
freaky , lil movie... . good though..
like i said b4 sandler and berrymore make a great comedy movie.. . with adams good singing in this movie it made too to be true !
my favorite movie of all time  !
i've seen this movie probably 4 times . it really is a great another work from sandler and his always comedy gold
cute , sweet romantic funny and adam sandler drew barrymore . plus mullets ! can it get any better ? no way
i love the story . fun suspence it
i think this movie is a wonderful comedy for all the people who are big fanz of adam sandler like me and to watch if you feeling down becuz alwayz cheerz up! !
the wedding singer is an extremly well made movie , and it deserves so much credit for what went into . has best lines adam sandler excellent role as robbie hart takes place in 1985 a small suburban town falls love with julie who getting married to rat cheating on her but he's rich robbie's poor likes better too nervous tell him
not only is this a film with all the trappings of good romantic comedy (there's little suspense , there's few unexpected twists and turns but best certainty that it will work out in end) has added value being set 80s - rubix cubes ? new coca-cola sweat bands bring 'em on ! really sweet to cuddle up some fun music along way .
this is a great movie . it's original , really funny and keeps you interested throughout the whole everyone in does job especially elderly woman who that hip hop song
i love adam sandler . he is soo sweet and sexy in this movie the end when robbie sings to julia on plane that kiss.....
classic mel brooks stuff . sheer comedic brilliance
this is simply a classic comedy .
*dink*
a fantastic movie . i loughed so much try it out and you'll lough too
another fantastic job by mel brooks . rick moranis is gold as the bumbling vilain , dark helmet
a great movie for nerds like me who to quote the funniest scenes of movies . my friends and i can go on spaceballls kick all day this is lampooning first star wars , think even people haven't seen will find one very funny
released in 1975 , steven spielberg's jaws set the standard for summer blockbuster movies that we now take granted . those who have been too afraid to get water film is new england coastal town of amity which suddenly plagued by a great white shark right before season police chief martin brody (roy scheider) thereby put conflict with mayor larry vaughn (murray hamilton) realizes closing beaches will devastate town's tourist based economy nevertheless push eventually comes bites and body sets off kill ichthyologist matt hooper (richard dreyfuss) crusty old salt quint (robert shaw) on latter's boat orca besides flawless casting spielberg uses camera angles deep focus contrasting dialogue literary historical allusions references (eg moby dick sinking u.s.s indianapolis) build tension mood instance taking advantage flawed fake prop shows attacks from shark's point view adds mystery horror unknown uncontrolled bottom line music scenes battle scars) lines you're gonna need bigger boat) are all part common human experience
spaceballs is one of the funniest mel brooks movies out there . it a personal favorite mine and it's just as funny ever time i see highly suggest this movie
another guy i have a soft spot for is john candy . he always makes me laugh
this was a good flick.man how i miss john candy , what loss !
it was a very funny movie i liked alot
so stinking funny ! i love macaulay culkin and john candy
uncle buck is in my opinion among the best of john hughes movies . it's a story about wrong-side-of-the-tracks gambler who has to get know his upscale brother's family and help them out bad situation macaulay culkin girl played little sister were adorable funny ; laurie melcalf as marcie , horny neighbor was priceless mother older added right amount tension make movie bit character study if you liked home alone planes trains automobiles you'll like
john candy's best role ever ! i still can't believe he is dead .
love it ! excellent comedy .
this movie is wonderful . i love it to no end think it's a shame most people my age haven't seen , nor will they ever
a very dark comedy , one of the best . bud cort and ruth gordon are excellent in their roles harold's suicide attempts actually funny harold maude's relationship is poignant believable as molfan pointed out this movie not for everyone i laugh everytime watch
it's a dark comedy but i loved it and thought was very funny . the acting exceptional
arguably the best film in world ever - i defy you not to be moved by it !
one of the best black comedies progressive director generation late 60's early 70's . satirical and sometimes ironic , h m is a great example movie made from perspective without being overtly hippie young upper class man harold living with his cold preoccupied mother has developed an obsession death to elicit emotional response (once seen years earlier when she believed him killed) he sets up mock suicide attempts varying complexities by time we see current become apathetic even bit annoyed behavior spends free attending anonymous funerals at which first meets maude over course how 79 year old spirit changes world this sheltered boy/man
it's hard to imagine a stranger screen couple than bud cort and ruth gordon . she's an elderly lady with zest for life after surviving the holocaust , he's very young guy obsessed death who fakes his own suicides on constant basis just upset mother pretty dark comedy but some of cort's fake mother's reactions them are hilarious
this was considered a cult classic comedy . the stars were ruth gordon and bud cort they both had preoccupation with death loved going to funerals , which is where met there some hysterical scenes in movie like maude driving pick-up truck trying rescue tree that dying while police chasing her you have right sense of humor enjoy but many us seen it over
lily tomlin , jane fonda and dolly parton had such great screen chemistry that they actually made a weak script into something awesome  ! i really think this movie would have been huge flop if it wasn't for the of these 3 women . comedy could watch over storyline as well
9 to 5 is definatly one of the funniest movies ever made , and may be called classic day . it never stops delivering laughs it's fast-paced exciting judy violet dorlee are 3 secretaries a sexiest egotistical lying hypocritical bigot boss mr hart was perfect movie colin higgins director recieves full credit
great in it's time . a little out-dated now but classic my book
funny movie ! and it had a lot of our favorite cartoon characters . was very original , i surprised the first time saw even though there are some adult innuendos stuff like that in thats okay cause its fun for adults kids to enjoy together if could watch again would
a great movie from start to finish , with one-liners and excellent special effects . the whole idea of toons living real people (or vice-versa) was fascinating i really wish they had made sequel this one
seeing a stupid comedy like monty python being number one and witty fun this 102 is an insult . awesome everybody needs to see the story cartoon rabit get frammed for murder only guy who can save him former detective adults will love adult themes play on words while kids cartoons slapstick of greatest films all time that no resist that's folks
a true classic , combining music suspence camera work and acting . memorable characters wonderful performances one of the best movies ever made first summer blockbusters
but i don't want the drink .
drink the !
very funny , a great blend of live action and animation .
a fun , clever and genius movie of bringing animation together with real actors . roger rabbit is just so cute it much watching bob hoskins interact all the cartoon characters
probably spielberg's best film , this one is overlooked at times even though it was groundbreaking . the use of live actors with animated characters had never been done in an entire feature length to my knowledge are fun and funny same time voice-overs brilliant unlike a lot films there actually plot someone trying destroy toontown
let's see , original characters disney warner bros . characters.. funny plot ! not your typical kiddie movie.. it was great
what a great film . if you haven't seen it - where have been living ? under rock completely original , fantastic deserves all its 5-star glory see ! i really loved the way cartoons and real people mixed was amazing when saw first it's essential too bad bob hoskins ended out making super mario bros summary : hilarious
i loved this movie ! is a great blend of animation and regular motion picture . wasn't the funniest , but it was
an excellent film , probably speilberg's greatest ever .
wow . until today i forgot all about this movie haven't watched it since was 10 and i'm regrettting is one of the funniest coolest movies ever ! have to go rent right now
this movie is a riot . i laugh my bootata off to day when see flick great blend of humor and drama not mention very impressive visual effects have you ever seen before or sense that blended both live action animation come out with better film ? if say the adventures rocky bullwinkle will drop kick swear god ! anyway , actors hold their own toon comrades in unforgetable crime capper farce weasles are hilariouse as well beny cab baby herman jessica rabbit has some definate sex appeal i'd still go her over julia roberts.highly recommended
who framed roger rabbit is a stunning display of film/animation . the story highly imaginative , combining cartoon world with real there still isn't quite anything like this movie it's in class its own
roger rabbit , a cartoon character is framed for the murder of live-action human . this movie combination and animation mix disney warner bros animated co-stars cameos (the fight between daffy duck donald not to be missed) live action interact lot more than any other made including phantom menace
this was a tremendous cinematic achievement and should be remembered as one the top films of last 10-15 years . brilliantly put together by robert zemeckis , who framed roger rabbit brings world live action with animation you get absolutely lost in interaction forget that there is obviously no way eddie valiant could having conversation an animated combination would itself make remarkable movie-making feat but story great well it both laugh out loud funny quite touching heart-warming if have always gone right film you've been deciding what to rent or buy next time stop grab you'll love whether you're 8 28 48 68
who framed roger rabbit was not only a classic and hilarious , but jessica could do it for any male . cares if she is cartoon ?
jessica rabbit is hot .
jaws is a great flim and it's very suspenseful keeps you on the edge of your seat! ! one those thillers that regretable if don't call this true , classic!
one of the best films last 20 yrs . never been anything like it since
another kevin smith movie that simply is funny no matter who you are . adams plays off affleck very well and the rest of cast hits their marks awesome script , though a little graphic vulgar until this point could do wrong
one of my favorite films ever . i love the dialogue , characters story everything kevin smith is a genious in his own right
obviously kevin smith had something personal to say . and this movie is a perfect thing though vulgar sarcastic (love that stuff) it totally real these are just everyday people not many lesbians would like ben affleck , i was actually in there for holden mcneil lets us forget hooper-x the black man god last but also best.. guess yet thorne ? banky ! f@%#$ % edwards jason lee once again gives dynamic performance that's why he's my hero oh jay silent bob save day with weed wisdom great aside from fact screws everything up it's still good renee zelweger hughjackman's mate .. joey lauren adams moron so i'll leave you this. four lane road canter crisp $100 bill at each end of male affectionate lesbian an angry as f@$# hating dyke santa easter bunny.. who'll reach first correct do know why?..
this is my favorite movie.....it's great
awesome movie
i feel that this was one of kevin smiths best films , mean even liked ben affleck . like how smith has a way taking thing might happen and makeing them funnier hell !
it's one of the greatest films!!! !
sweet and perhaps a little mindless , it sets out to entertain accomplishes it's goal- sneaking some life lessons under all that blonde . the comedy factor is fun steady smartly written reese witherspoon utterly charming her acting perky concise honest movie nothing deep but its certainly amusing enjoyable
this is such an excellent movie . it made me feel good , and was so cute as always reese witherspoon does a superb job if you are in down mood want lift rent or legally blonde 2 both available on dvd ! also cool for people who love chihuahua dogs very few movies show these particular smart they truly we  no actress could ever top your talent
cute movie . love the dog !
favor movie ever love it !
i'm just a big reese fan . her natural cuteness sells this film
a really pleasantly surprising movie , i enjoyed it even much more than anticipated ! now am looking forward to the 2nd legally blonde
this movie is entertaining and adorable . it gives folks a different view of cute,popular , seemingly shallow people its funny modern without being stupid vulgur
i love reese
finally ! a movie about girl who's just like me this is so wonderful , reese witherspoon great and there are lots of funny moments . (can you say bunny outfit?) i'll definatly be watching one over again until i get bored pink or/and grow up
such a delightful , funny movie . i really enjoyed it
suprisingly smartly written , and reese witherspoon was great ! very funny especially for those that worshiped clueless when it first came out . legally blonde brings you back but is more grown up definitely recommended
totally entertaining , a feel good movie for sure . reese witherspoon is charming i really enjoyed it
an american classic .  .jaws is still a great film 20+ years later robert shaw as quint example of character acting
wonderful movie . tommy lee jones and will smith are so great together in this they play off each other exceptionally well there some unnecessarily gross parts of , but overall it's hysterical pity the sequel wasn't as good
was a great treat in the theater .
hysterical and original ! i can watch it again never get bored
this is one of speilburg's best films and it has a great cast . the editing for film amazing especially when you have brodie sitting on teh beach looking out to sea make sure that its safe people walking past in their different coloured bathing suits determines how close shot richard drefuss as usual , him are trying convince mayor should be closed there was definately white waters makes comment about he starts laughing suspense element done perfection with famous music signature shame they ruined by doing all other jaws movies
all conspiracy flicks have to give stylish , plausible unexpected answers forgotten everyday paradoxes and mysteries . men in black did that a bag of chips funny smart perfectly cast even touching (though bit icky-gross) this is more comedy buddy cops than star-trek type sci-fi flick i laughed so hard an alien came out my chest
other than raiders , this is my favorite spielberg film . it just grabs you and won't let go..
creative , funny captivating movie . there is nothing else like it the was fun all way through i never bored probably due to casting
this was a very funny movie with great cast . tommy lee jones and will smith worked together i thought the story original script witty good
i had a hard time swimming in lake or an ocean for while after seeing this one . true classic that put spielberg on the map
hilarious , good special effects great storyline .
funny , x 1,000,000 !
very cute .
too cute , perfect and i still love it . this remake is just as good the original steve martin hilarious kimberly williams simple fluffy fun
one of the first non-disney movies i ever saw . loved it then , and love more every time see steve martin is funniest comedians !
excellent!! ! fantastic acting , terrific chemistry among the entire cast wonderful story filled with laughter and tears
classic , i must have seen about 500 times .
jaws is certainly one of the most heart-pounding motion pictures ever made . it introduced to world superb talents director , steven spielberg and musician john williams two men who have defined cinema today immensely entertaining highly suspenseful what psycho alfred hitchcock
callmetootie is an idiot . steve martin hilarious , and short one fo the great supporting actors in a comedy this movie cast makes it work
this movie is very sweet and realistic (except the martin short character!) it makes me go , hey when can i get married ! a real winner
the greatest film ever made . it's just brilliant
not for everybody . but such a wonderful cast , and directed by tim burton this film to very day is under-recognized it my favorite i believe stands above the rest has style way of pulling strings well pull !
great casting .
very good and funny i dont think seen a movie yet with johnny depp thats hasent been . he is actor
the only thing funnier than this movie are ed wood's real movies . problem is , they weren't meant to be funny he's a classic case of guy who had nothing but an insatiable desire make sci-fi flicks...and i mean whole real-life story poor bela lugosi and unbelievable true
i think this is a very clever movie , well scripted with some solid performances . if you're looking for many belly-laughs you'd best rent something else but funny nonetheless
my favorite comedy ever . i can't count the number of times i've watched it (i own it) best scene : tootsie is trying to hail a cab take her , late already first day work taxis streak by igoring meek little lady voice until squeeling breaks are heard after middle-aged women yells out taxi ! in very low man's cracks me up every single time
jaws is excellent . the shark scary and music good too
dustin hoffman brings the house down in this delightful comedy , that paved way for mrs . doubtfire and other crossdressing favorites a different movie from most comedies thereby making it deserving of high rating individuality if nothing else not to mention is insanely funny
i was surprised to see that tootsie so far down the list.dustin hoffman great as an out of work actor who dresses up a woman audition for part.{this after his agent told him no one would hire him.} he ends getting role on daytime soap  . being known be difficult , not much different when did like script show adlib and say it way thought his/her character well audience loved this take guff character.and temporary got extended meanwhile grows really actress still has parade results from all can real funny misunderstandings.he now back himself into corner must get we found movie enjoyable with lot laughs
tootsie is one of the best comedy movies ever made . unable to find acting work , michael dorsey (dustin hoffman) disguises himself as a woman and hired on soap opera dorothy michaels hospital administrator what follows series absolutely hilarious events based deception hoffman forced deal with women's things such building wardrobe applying make-up dieting dealing chauvinistic bosses etc. he also has fend off advances various admirers particularly funny scene takes place when john van horn dorothy's co-workers serenades her outside apartment flustered invite him in riotously which bill murray (michael/dorothy's roommate) confronts would-be suitor even though i've seen so many times lost count i never fail enjoy it thoroughly
this is an awesome movie . nothing happens ? actually a lot realistic , not charlie's angels plot : struggling alcholic writer and his soon to be married friend go bachelor party trip through the california wine country explores two middle age failures it very funny
my favorite woody allen film . it's hilarious , and says more about relationships than any comedy i've seen (even annie hall) when harry met sally......give me a friggin break !
i know loved it , but can't remember why . the soundtrack--the entire ambience for that matter--is wonderful enough ...my wry sense of humor and astonishing sexual technique.. --pretty funny coming from woody allen it's little things he throws in his natural
as you can see by my username this film terrifies me . even today if i'm far out from the beach i think of movie and it's music steven speilberg more amazingly was only about 26 (the same age me) when he directed it chances seeing a effective again are extremely slim also does anyone know new version that supposed to be released couple years ago in theaters i've heard nothing re-issue plans i'd just love on big screen , would really something !
brilliant . mabey woody's best movie shot in glorious black and white with gershwin raging on the soundtrack
incredible witty and wonderful . even more a joy if you know these types b/c then it becomes dead on parody well-written adaption i was worried enjoyed the hornby novel(back when he still writing amusing novels) , but film translated perfectly for american audience cusack handled rob gordon with comedic grace
rob and the musical morons are very funny . well scripted , brilliant performance by cusack a good soundtrack clever witty
very , funny . i thought it would suck because the novel tool place in england but film took chicago (?!) cusak is just damn jack black hysterical as uber-cool know-it-all music store nerd great and laughs get a look at tim robbins hippie conflict-resolution specialist 
excellent it was so funny especially catherine zeta-jones
absolutely and totally fantastic , steven spielberg was about 27 years old when he made this movie ! amazing the music's terryfying too
one of the best comedies i've ever seen . it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't try so hard be funny has great view and insights about relationships too
black is phenominal here . but cusack , hell i thought he was starring in the movie of my life for a while (i not total @#$% ! by 3/4 way through mark.) all time top 5 sure
the first time i saw trailer thought to myself : what is this ? second it , sighed . third became interested in going see and fourth was convinced unfortunately never did go instead best thing bought book read then video didn't mind change of cities much something that bother me remotely fact his laura blonde (in she a brunette) charlie brunette blonde) other than loved ! especially parts store burst out towards laura's new boyfriend like mentioned earlier they had changed lot things ('slight spoilers coming up') for an example one girlfriends on breakup list he visit parents meet couple with horrible music taste those were some most enjoyable moments but cusack (both them) brilliant simply jack black hilarious would still recommend people who movie (if haven't already) may take you by surprise
john cusack is amazing in this film . he has matured as an actor and i believe his best great fictional that tells non-fictional things about girls experiences happen reality
from the distance of twenty-five years , it still holds up as one greats . only minor caveat is robert shaw's hammy performance which clearly shows he thought was acting in a piece crap otherwise everything particularly direction brilliant spielberg's best movie along with television duel (not et not schindler's laundry list)
this movie is so classic . john cusack great in it and his staff at the record store really funny a slice of life , !
an innovative love story/comedy that made me go out and buy the book . film was much more eloquent endearing due to its presentation character development again , well integrated with a sound track
this was a great and awesome movie . i would recommend people to go see , especially if you are in relationship
my first cinema experience . still the best horror film and suspense thriller set on water spielbergs mastery was evident even this his third as a director music , editing screenplay well composed executed
this is the movie about males and relationships . surprisingly actually have feelings a great commentary on male perspective of relationship , focusing how one man handles break up with long time girlfriend also for music lovers by i mean obssesive collectors who really know their stuff stunningly well done adaptation book screen writers successfully change narrative from english slang (british) to american fine
once again , john cusack has created a classic . this is one relationship movie that any guy can appreciate also great introduction to music you may not have heard before jack black steals the show
cusack is great !
it's 2 years of relationship therapy packed into hours . a great deal !
even though there was an excess of cursing and farting , the movie still gut busting fall down funny .
the movie that kept me away from beach for over three years ! excellent music by john williams and direction steven speilberg . dvd is fantastic
how can you go wrong with gay satan and an ass-happy sadam hussein ?
this movie is the grossest crudest most offensive i ever saw . there anything funny about 9-year old children cursing like drunken sailors ? strangely , yes..
now i can see why to some this might be offensive , but like south park think it's a clever and funny show the movie was no exception . make it better written as musical parker stone went after canada- sheer genius!(btw do canada) could not stop laughing at uncle(you know what) song with lots of laughs for everyone
hello clarise .
spielberg's best movie (deal with it) . robert shaw makes you care the shark squirm schneider cheer dreyfuss is pleasant man vs nature to a degree that kicks hemingway's ass
i love south park and this movie yet am a conservative . i'm not race-hating warmonger believe that in the it was clinton who declared war kyle's ultraliberal barbara streisand-loving mother spearheaded whole thing main underlying theme of is about how parents don't wanna take responsibility for their own kids need to stop bitchin at all environmental factors some time talk right wrong calm sensical terms.. instead teaching them hateful intolerance toward people they disagree with matt trey have made clear over years are anti-conservatives fact when you watch show can pick up many often values issues like abortion , parenting ethics least persistance ultraliberals seek force beliefs on moderates others unlike fans intolerant conservatives
funny as sh*t !
i absolutely love this friggin movie!!!! ! its the funiest movie ive ever seen!!!! couldnt stop laughing and mai stomach hurted!!! anyways it . 5 stars dude
i give this 5 stars , not for being a good movie but an absolutely positively hilarious . could watch it over and again was scream ! ( shut your f**king face uncle f**ker ) see now the funniest i've ever seen funnier than austin powers even life of brian summary : absoutely original cartoon
i understand that it is a highly offensive movie , but if you are willing to let yourself go and just laugh at the jokes turns out be one of funniest movies around . nothing else least fastforward through everything songs music makes worth watching deserving four star rating by itself
one of the funniest film i have ever seen . never laughed so hard in my life and it was from beginning to end ! know this isn't high on list because people are pansey asses offended at drop a hat south park offers no apologeze must be watched with an open mind human sense humor jokes come you fast let up next cannibal : musical , is trey parker matt stones best work.actually very intelligent interesting farce society our constant blaming others instead looking ourselves highly recommended
i saw it when first came out was a little girl . still can not get into my pool and take night swim w/ thinking about that scene the is in ocean , dark aaaaahhhhhh. jaws kills her !
my second best comedy film chan is the man but not without chris tucker he gives movie it's .
i like jackie chan movies . he makes some of the better martial arts out there loved las vegas connection scene with gay (whassa word for high class clothing salesmen ? - yeah thats one) guys trying to get those two suited up properly was a scream ! my wife lived in years and caught all 'local humor'- are levels humor this film that if you know , jackie's think outtakes alone worth price admission so do our teen aged kids
one of the more funny modern non-disney comedy movies that i have recently seen , this is great with antics chris rock and sometimes-deadpan sometimes over-the-top comedic timing jackie chan . although not as good cartoon adventures it still a movie lots dialogue fight scenes wish they hadn't used bad language however
very funny movie to watch with a actors . this is repeat
a well done movie.i remember hearing that the reason why we did not see shark lot was because they could get it to work . when filming turned out good thing i think anticipation of coming keep me in suspense.the actors are all here comes music' great.the only bad part saw this movie huge theater for first time and television does give same effect though
chris tucker is an awesome actor he so funny . jackie chan cool stuntman the first movie was good this one great
i agree with glorybox . this film definitely exceeded my expectations , because wasn't quite as impressed the first one most people were but then time around it seems was more than a few certainly laughing out loud and much entertained since there lot of unexpected turns best comedies i've seen in good while oh yeah love zhang ziyi too opinion no girl can pull off no-nonsense (yet still likeable) toughness like she
a great film totally recommended to anyone of any age . the first rush hour was mildly entertaining only becuase it's 2 main stars , but this an extremely good movie chris tucker is back as wisecracking high talking bust your a$$ lapd and jackie chan once again tito duo defintiely fine see worth money time
i really didn't expect to enjoy this movie . thought the first one was chuckle-worthy at best , but not especially humorous went see it only because of my friends is a huge fan all things asian (espeically jackie chan)and she asked me settled in chair ready be bored with usual unfunny sequel fare and surprised myself when actually started laughing out loud antics (the still annoying nothing can help man)chris tucker chan (his american comedy date.)it nice zhang ziyi(don't think spelled that right) again after her amazing turn crouching tiger hidden dragon would highly recommened anyone need mindless good laugh most big time conossuiers(damn can't spell) ever even knowing how inane supposed they little know
that must be one of my favourite english comedies ever . witty , original with a perfect screenplay (they made wonderful use this lovely sheffield slang) few pretty outstanding performances (mark addy in particular) good kitchy disco music you may start liking after movie highly recommended
everyone should own a copy of this movie . i have seen jaws 143 times , so far the music is awesome love hate beach
good character study;cute comedy
one of the funniest films all times ! if you did not see it then surely are missing greatest comedies.....do yourself a favor and rent soon....better yet , just buy you'll want to own for sure :-)
jaws is my second favorite movie of all time . i seem to have a thing for movies set in clautrophobic environment this case , it the orca on which three men are hunting shark along with rear window can watch film over and again never tire !
this is my favourite ever movie . it has everything adventure,comedy cowboys , it's a road western i just love
city slickers is a great movie that most don't know about! !
an outstanding romantic comedy from the male's perspective . what is most brilliant about favreau's writing of this piece that he realized with men , occurs before romance ever starts a modern classic and should be pre-requisite for any young man
i'm not sure how i lasted so long without seeing this movie , but it just turned out that way . after hearing friends of mine rave about quote from ( did you get the digits ? ) and compare themselves to characters in was kind expecting worst swingers is fact an amazing - oddly touching it's a guys' through does very believable job portraying single guys act towards each other falling into trap beer commercial stereotypes definitely rent for your buddy who coming off rough break up five stars
swingers is one of my favorite movies all time . in college , this was our drinking i agree with the other viewers who say a movie males would like i've seen it few girls and only but friends we've at least ten times laugh same part isn't that minute its where you can relate also will have vocabulary your head for weeks
in the day of aids , internet and phone sex club scene has seemed to plummet past decade but swingers was just film revive it ! a about male camraderie drills holes into some our accepted stereotypes men while reaffirming other ones . heartsick,sensitive mikey down-to-earth sensible rob too cool for words trent his quick-tempered partner crime sue not only serve as main characters this stereoypes that have been generated since dawn cinema what is so wonderful favreau's script he gives us moments where actors can stop being their start human ie big t standing on table diner ranting going clubs those are when female preconceived notions breaking down ideal real thinking people replacing them i can't think better comedy gen-xers women see together would give chance ask questions explain
this movie is really funny . if you like to go out and have a good time you'll love you're dork not for
swingers is one of my favorites all-time and the first movie i actually purchased . it brilliantly written by jon favreau who originally wrote so that he his friends would have a to star in as another reviewer , ruby said this isn't laugh out loud funny instead any guy watches will see just about every scene hits home some way vince vaughn steals trent women want sleep with guys be fellas if you haven't seen film check your girlfriend won't like much do but make up for all times she made sit through those chick-flicks
one of the best movies recent years . it's not a laugh-out-loud comedy like many on this list , but its hilarious in parts and engaging throughout real life look at guys some ways swingers is male version fried green tomatos or those other quintessential chick after all about how four 20-something cope with friend that's lovesick depressed while i know female viewers get turned off by little flashes misogyny more important message movie quirks friendship friends rally to help each non-obvious
unique .
vince vaughn is a cutie in this movie jon favreau hysterical !!! !
i was the targeted audience when this movie released . great commentary on a group of guys in their mid-20s who all have different values and agendas there are so many scenes that make me feel like am experiencing deja-vu from situations been think sequel should be order
sup peeps this movie rocks the house
the godfather of all shark movies . started whole era in hollywood
one of the absolute funniest movies i have seen in some time . a must watch for any guy aftermath breakup
great ! love it
i really like comedies , romance or both . this is so cute lucy saves man from being hit by a train pretends to be his fiance while he in coma but falls love with brother jack her too she tells them the truth before gets married and then proposes they get go florence italy can stamp on passport
i liked this movie which thought was going to hate . can't relate some of the scenarios (talk about out an understatement!) but still found funny and provakative , say least
this movie is very freaky ! i think it one of the best , if not monster ever made . when first saw scared hell out me
i love this film ! and any female over 25 can relate to some of bridget's happenings if not all . haven't we sat there on a sofa singing into hairbrush ? been overally obsessed with our weight made blue soup is quite simply hilarious when she tells her boss/ex lover (hugh grant) i'd rather wipe sadam hussains a**e , laughed out loud you go girl fully appreciate would have be but are guys that like it too colin firth lovely in renee acts the part naturally english accent excellent
this movie was so great . any female who faces the dating dilemmas bridget jones does can relate to renee zellweger abolsutely hilarious in role-and convincing that an english acquaintance of mine thought british , intstead texan she really should have gotten oscar for role good it
oh my ! it's exactly the story of life minus vodka fags and happy ending.. .
i read this book a year or two ago and absolutely hated it . i'm still not big fan of fielding , but did enjoy movie very much quite sure why found charming liked that bridget was kinda chunky she got her groove on sexy have new respect for renee zellweger after watching film-not only british accent especially horrible played with lovely mix humor thoughtfulness absolutley love colin firth thought he the dry witty mark darcy well (interesting note : mr in e version pride predjudice novel which b.j.d is based somewhat loosley my opinion.) hugh grant surprisingly good less floppy too all would highly recommend to any romantic comedy last scene
i tend to be completely fascinated with sharks in the first place , but honestly who wouldn't like this movie ? it still raises fear many people . special effects were great for that time makes me practically speechless
wonderfully funny . on the way , though it is also sad and terribly suspending oddly enough virtually same story as pride prejudice  only set into moderns surroundings does not help that mr darcy played by colin firth however he perfect nice guy thought to be bad.. perfect.. movie for once much better than book
what a great movie.....i enjoyed every minute of it
you have to be a woman get the funny bits , though . and nothing can really beat book wich lauhed my head of reading couple months ago bridget is in many ways only true picture out ime because all we see are young skinny models/actresses hollywood they don t tell much about how but does that s it i am like want shag daniel for life mark respect someone who says : just way  both them so cute must say wouldn hugh grant world would good old darcy whenever if he could ask.... well this end rating hope !
what a great change of pace from all the so-called realistic message movies where goal filmmakers seems to be geared more toward political persuasion than entertainment . bridget jones diary definitely qualifies as later and , an added bonus even throws in little bouquet hopefulness for you take home remember kind film i m talking about ; leave theater discussing lines funny parts don t feel had dragged through gutter or insane asylum price your admission acting was excellent hugh grant pretty much cracked me up throughout colin firth wonderful discovery though know ve seen him before - this first time really sat took notice just talented actor he is ready cringe heard renee zellweger attempt accent but soon found could relax since she did job with it well enough sound convincing fellow americans like myself anyway impressive overall outstanding work her character if enjoy light romantic comedy being delightfully entertained choice
this is well done , witty movie that i highly recommend . it worth the ticket price and a second or third viewing !
i only mildly enjoyed the book , but had to see movie because colin firth as mark darcy alone made me want laugh (read then sequel really understand brilliant casting!) . loved this ! laughed out loud at renee zellweger was wonderful (and like her better with extra weight) perfectly darcy-ish and hugh grant such a cad totally recommend especially for fans of e's pride prejudice - there are lots inside jokes being least them keep your eyes peeled crispin bonham-carter name publishing house where bridget works
enjoyed book . thought film would be disappointment wrong enough twists to keep even most adamant fans of novel surprised a bridget who seemed unlikely at first , but came real by end laughed my way through it renee's accent little bizarre adds comedy itself her really is v good character full humour and truth hugh all with made for him without any usual nervous twittering that so famous colin firth looked shaggable in suit see if want english rom com
i haven't seen it yet , but can't wait to . great cast (renee zelweger and hugh grant are one of the best) i'll give a five just because know it's gonna be good
an instant classic !
surprisingly funny
this movie should be at least top 20 . i thought had everything a great comedy is supposed to have one of my all time favorites it was hilarious !
while i have never been prone to website postings , found the comment of jyoun06 on 10/26 so stirring my soul that it warranted an immediate response . rotn indeed featured share veteran actors but feel ensemble cast was highlighted by some smaller roles which though short screen time come up big presence and memorablility important note is performance carl cherry billed only as tri-lamb  recent studies film scholars revealed evidence this ghost in darkness may fact be lawrence mosquito fans will recall often mentioned rarely seen brother lambda brethren has denied his rightful claim role for 16 years hopefully with truth now clear cinematic world embrace him accomplishments would like commend lance lombardo accomplished set director,the rush hour (1998) money talks (1997) off (1996) 1984 a daring young actor few people were challenge portray lamar s date controversial homosexual inter-racial relationship society not sympathetic towards gays mid-80 rumor subject ridicule alpha beta camp if released later could yielded oscar nomination its abundance honesty emotion (remember when he bites phallic balloon hat.) finally kres mersky who made debut check out girl oh god ! (1977) gives portrayal mrs wormser forced drop her son (andrew cassesse) gymnasium refugee can anyone else see obvious reference sophie choice mother give child ? such literary references are common place writing team flores-tejada buhei render poignant social commentary however duo does leave one plot point unresolved at conclusion what happened gilberts dad
this movie has been greatly overlooked in american filmography . jeff kanew brings together an experienced cast including david wohl (d.a.r.y.l and brewster's millions) , who plays the upstart fickle dean eulich michelle meyrink( nice girls don't explode) judy a tawdy gorgeous accordion playing temptress it is difficult to forget writing that clicked thanks miguel tejada-flores also worked on made for tv film heads you live tails your dead buhai best known whoopee boys starring paul rodriguez rotn !
awesome movie . anthony hopkins has the ability to scare anyone !
my favorite movie after animal house  . this is definately a classic on list
revenge of the nerds is genius .
awesome movie . pure comedic genius jim carey at his finest (before the majestic) i love this brand of slap-staick "i just got robbed by a little old lady on motorised scooter... and didn't even see it coming"
without a doubt the funniest movie of all time . jim carey is maybe person ever , and jeff daniels isn't to shabby either i have say it ridiculus that this rated as low there are many classic scenes in should be listed #1 dumb dumber get recognition deserves
yeah , i'm disappointed at how this is so low on the list . one of those movies you can watch anytime and always laugh jim carrey jeff daniels are great together there many funny lines sight gags make just looking his face
why the heck is this movie so low on list ? i've never seen someone match jim carrey as well jeff daniels to utimately make one of funniest movies ever . i'll admit there are better movies.. but c'mon my big fat greek wedding while you were sleeping no way , dumb and dumber much funnier ! get too old laugh at kind if in order be grown up can't enjoy a like i'm not gonna
this movie was hilarious . jeff daniels just as funny jim carrey if not funnier
this is jim carey at his best . movie had me in tears the first time i saw it and still love to watch grade school bathroom humor it's
i love this movie ! jim carey and jeff daniels both do a great job playing couple of bumbling fools with sub-human intelligence . the writers did putting jokes in script as much possible , yet tying everything together i'm tired people who insinuate that one's preference entertainment has anything to course is ridiculous stupid but it's also hilarious dumb dumber not meant be cinematic masterpiece ; supposed funny entertaining which it definitely accomplished going say if you hated have no soul or sense humor like different laugh at kinds comedy just saying from my end can't imagine why someone wouldn't find flick
haha
irish , you just reduced me to tears . lol i laughed my head off at this crazy movie sorry !
this should be way higher . definitely a guy movie
one of my fav movies all time . jim carrey is great in this movie a classic
i really like jaws because when the shark eats people up . feel that are stupid and don't think
it was hilarious well so is every thing when jim carry in and jeff daniels .

hey irishgit , get a sense of humor ! this movie is an all time classic that keeps you laughing the entire . must have dvd when you're feeling blue
jim carrey's best movie !
i don't know why this movie is in the top ten on list because every scene classic !
my all time favorite comedy . i love this movie the sequel ruined it though
if you are into goofy , slapstick comedy then this movie is for .
jaws is , of course a classic which everyone should see and enjoy . one the first movies who used such high technology for that day after country saw people were actually afraid to swim in oceans again
this belongs in the top 20 . american pie is above ? give me a break ! jim carrey's funniest movie , and i've seen it 100 times i still laugh every time i'll never forget when cop drinks beer  absolutely hilarious you wanna hear most annoying sound world aaaaahhhhh
the best movie of all time ! i can't believe people on this website criticized it is my most fave and has been for years . it's one you can never get sick if you've seen i'll personally make you(literally , bought friend christmas cuz she hadn't it) anyway its a you'll quote constantly intance just today said to expected rocky mountains be little rockier than so have many times that seriously memorized it...word word me n bf love pappy frappy 4 life
one of the top 20 comedies all time . this will be remembered as carrey's funniest if you like goofy physical comedy , it doesn't get any better carrey is jerry lewis generation
one of the funniest movies ever . you are dumb if cant relax enough to just enjoy this movie i'm sorry my friend here is a little slow town that way
comedic entertainment at its best . and just talking about scenes from the movie can be every bit as fun hilarious watching it
one of the funniest movies ever made ! jim and jeff were hilarious together . a 5 just isn't high enough for this awesome movie
this is my favorite movie of all time . i wish more movies like one would be released they should definetly come out with a dumb and dumber2 because hilarious... as for you mat mann whoever are must have the worst sense humour ever if don't find jim carrey jeff daniels funny , then just end your life i'd hate to live that so dull
jaws is a good scary movie which has scared me since i was kid . the fact that something like big shark in water scares most people much suspense and violence
it's not supposed to stimulate your mind , but a damn funny movie . stills makes me laugh harder then any other
one of the funniest movies ever made , few you can watch 37 thousand times and still laugh at every great scene .
i can't help laughing every time see it . this was great jeff daniels nothing short of perfect for the role and needs to be said about good ol' jim
this really is a classic comedy film . the stupidy of two characters incredible there are so many quotable lines
this movie had me laughing till the neighbours phoned cops and even then i couldn't stop
i used to think that this was a completely stupid , silly movie . and jim carrey is just nuisance at times but now know genuinely amusing good film nothing like trip aspen california if only the ending different..
if people don't like this movie , they know what funny is .
i love this movie to death ! know all the lines and guess it's because jim carrey . he's brilliant in , as well jeff daniels story is unique original thge classic humour fantastic e.g pedi dead oh man i'm sorry harry what happened ? his head fell off yeah he was pretty old a crazy insane that will leave you stitches if you're not great fan of would say avoid nutty looking for bit fun definately worth watch!
dumb dumber is the best film ive ever seen and each time i watch it , just gets better . watched so many times know everything about who says anything negative this they cannot have !

will ferrel rules !
this was a great movie for kids consitering i am one . anyways love the part when buddy says these tolites are ginormiss that funny !
the four food groups are  : 1) candy , 2) canes 3) corn and 4) syrup . this is greatest holiday film ever & kids will love it almost as much grown-ups
very funny holiday fare . will be a xmas classic 50 years from now i like just about everything ferrel has done , and think he does great job here the movie keeps laughs plentiful hearty much funnier than either santa clauses dvd some excellent bonus features particularly games
a really funny family movie , with good message and values for everyone . moments that will make you laugh cry again buddy the elf whats your favorite color ?
jaws is the best horror movie because it still scares me today when i pass on regular channels . one of movies remember freaking out everybody in southern california so much that no wanted to go into water at beaches was good they made another two loved special effects great !
the music itself wasn't all that bad !
this is a hoot--puncturing the righteous folk music fad . i suppose most of you don't remember craze 1950's and 1960's lucky ! lots scrubbed up later scruffy cranks strummed hummed bummed their way around country warbling about oppression recession depression regression obsession , ad naseum movie skewers kingston trio ian sylvian others it great fun (i have an admission to make rather liked era!)
ea a o's ! if you've seen this movie as many times i have , you'll get joke . christopher guest's best so far....he manages to pull of good-natured spoof folkies sure some die hard folk music buffs may be offended but is satire with its heart in the right place
great film , really creepy and scary .
this movie gives a wonderful new spin on the idea of improvization . witty lines and amazing ability to sing brings out tun laughs...this is must see ...eugene levy so it katherine o'hara...the whole cast used their unique acting abilities create master piece thank you all
i love this movie ! but all of chris guest's movies he is king wha happend?????!!!!? ?
meticulous . down to the super-mellow balding backup musicians for mitch mickey adorned in all black peter yarrow-esque over-dramatic tenor of folksman alan barrows (christopher guest) after enough listening , music seems genuinely good i've always been a sucker bluegrass and harmony each actor shows great deal musical skill i will nitpick if may--if anything there were too many actors everyone who has ever christopher guest venture had make an appearance leaving little room character development but wow memorable moments improv is at its best it might as well come out on video it's not like anyone still going see theatre anymore me--great flick c co : i'll follow you ends earth
a mighty wind may not be as good best in show or waiting for guffman  , but it still gets my ***** rating . tells the story of group 60's folk singers who are about to reunite some have been more successful than others ones that certainly with their music characters wonderful actors amazing eugene levy is oscar-worthy catherine o'hara and parker posey you must see this film !
love eva mendez
great romantic comedy . will smith showed he's a comedic actor and eva mendes looked was his equal in smart very funny date movie this made me laugh smile thoroughly enjoyable an enthusiatic thumbs up !
hilarious ! will smith and kevin james worked surprisingly well together , eva mendes is smart sexy . even amber valetta better than the average model turned actress also look for julie ann emery in a small but funny role as eva's friend yeah it gets little sappy at times just when you start to reach pepto bismol smith's face swells from an allergic reaction or there some silly dancing not your romantic comedy most definately worth
it was not complex and oscar worthy but funny ! i loled my ass off all the way to las vegas with this movie . great casting too
this movie was hilarious , i can't wait to watch it again !
you want a funny movie , go see hitch ! it was hilarious . my friend and i laughed the whole way through as did her two aunts so wil smith cracked me up when he teaching guy to dance
my girlfriend and i found this movie to be completely hysterical . we haven't laughed that much at a in long time went with medium expectations (will smith was it , so couldn't all bad) were pleasantly surprised think works because it's reflection of how most people really feel about the dating scene particularly thought last half-hour or great when you see difficult is for him talk woman he loves highly recommend film!! !
i did not have any expectations when went to the theatres watch that movie . but was pleasently surprised will smith very funny and so were all other actors story crazy unique it made me laugh a lot is kind of you remember for long time great entertainment what looking
will smith is a date doctor , teaching all the pathetic guys in new york how to pick up even most stunning women . his motto that any man at particular moment has ability sweep woman off her feet he knows right moves things say until meets girl of dreams and kevin james are hilarious
classic action movie of the time and still stands up today . dun dun...we have all had that moment fear after seeing this movie-- jaws was coming for us
great one
a great movie .
mash the movie was very good . tv show pretty , but i think and its ability to display things they couldnt on give it a much bigger punch as is just one of those movies which will always be harmed ratings-wise by political message carried love humor story this see every time can find
when i first watched the mash series , was bored . but once you get into it is really good movie no exception has a very happy ending
a slightly above average war movie . m*a*s*h is based on the true life experience of author he was real doctor in unit korea book reads like newpaper account antics fortunatly , screenplay much better than novel elliot gould donald sutherland and tom skerrit all are terrific as draftee doctors only gary burgoff radr made transition from to tv series but robert altman wanted make point about vietnam have audience thnk so mentioned sparingly throughout it doesn't matter which set biting indicment against tha maddness causes
robert altman at his best.this spawned the t.v . series but is a much better product.elliot gould,donald sutherland and tom skerrit are three doctors not quite ready for military lifestyle.sally kellerman as hot lips duvall star army lifers who can't understand our heroes.great comic sequences especially football game abound.this isn't preachy like will make you wish was more film
i know people who are still afraid of going into the ocean because this movie . wish they had stopped with one and not made so many pathetic sequals jaws 14 , time he's really pissed coming to pool in your backyard
altman at his best .
among my favorites .
very funny . lots of physical comedy i just like how everyone turns out to be an assassin matthew perry as a henpecked , skittish dentist was good too
i'll admit...i'm a huge fan of chick flicks . the sweeter , sappier better many romantic comedies out there this is one best tom hanks charming and fantastic as ever i'm not big cutesy meg ryan but her i love that they never meet until end you're still convinced they're perfect for each other classic happy ending tale
this should be in a romantic drama category , but it also the top 20 . an excellent story with great actors
when i first saw this movie , was 12 years old . remember that the same weekend it my room getting painted and had to sleep downstairs in living on an air mattress all night long drifted out of thinking floating inflatable raft middle ocean with a 25 foot great white circling me not best night's ever but excellent classic
its a different kind of love story . i think that is what makes it great music and acting
i loved this movie . thought it was very sweet and romantic kept me hanging on until the end to see if sam annie met.i felt kind of bad for walter , because he a decent person even though still wanted get together am sucker those movies with happy ending
one of the few films that starts better than it ends.. . anyway : funny , sweet different ! i liked but if could give 4.5 would have prefered 9 out 10 :o)
very good...perhaps a stand up classic.. .
best stand up comedy i have seen in years !
one of the best war films ever made .
you have to appreciate this if claim like standup comedy . language is rough , but isnt supposed be for kids these men give insight into being black in america and make laugh while doing it
bernie mac needs his own show ! chris rock and tucker she be a king , too . cedric wasn't as funny usual
that movie was hilarious . i laughed so hard choked , cried and almost wet my pants bernie mac needs his own show
great actors/comedians with crazy senses of humor and plots intermissions within the movie which kept you entertained .
i totally laughed my ass off . this movie was so funny , especially bernie mac and d.l hughley they joked about stuff can relate to went see it with boyfriend he crying because hella highly recommended
i enjoy stand up comedy in all forums . although am not black , humor is descriptive and entertaining the skits were appropriate length transitions funny i've seen movie three times now it still to me
wow...this movie is powerful . i actually got the feeling like was a grunt and would never leave dafoe berenger were superb almost hard to watch
i'd have to say i liked this movie a lot . after whole year of dry , gimmicky comedies hogging up the screen is refreshing break from all that there little fluff in content and contains nothing more than pure comedy
the best movie of year . d.l hughley is i never knew how funny racism could be hope to see a sequel or tv show can't wait it on dvd
this movie was funny . it relates to you if grew up how the comedians did non-stop laughter throughout whole
very funny . i loved every act , from steve bernie cedric and d.l they all had material it kept me laughing the whole two hours
this movie rocked ! it was so funny , i must say all the guys did an outstanding performance . cedric entertainer ruled my favorite part when he said that no matter what brothers be runnin' you could in full on conversation and they just start running
finally , just a movie of jokes and more . four my favorite comedians in real life comedy by director
1 of my top 5 movies.wow!almost 100% flawless .
i like this movie because enjoy comedy . took off the stage and put it onto big screen provided non-stop laughs , which is a good thing for
this was without a doubt the funniest stand-up comedy movie i have ever seen . dl hughley , steve henry cedric entertainer  and bernie mac are comics in today circuit laughed from beginning of until end
i haven't laughed so hard to a movie in long time . their humor was very entertaining and it points out funny realities they are bad but is
hilarious . i usually wouldn't see this type of movie which really isn't a at all but was talked into it and very surprised the comics were kept me entertained to end
i saw this movie and it was hella funny . bernie mac the man
i liked this movie because have never laughed so hard and much in my entire life . the comedians were right om beat , they all excellent understand comedic timing
funny as hell ! a lot of racial jokes but they are very and all the comedians great .
the best movie in world !
just happened to be on tv this evening . always knew it was considered a powerful movie , but never actually watched before watching i have say it's the most touching piece of cinema i've seen since schindler's list my first impression : you know s**t like that's happening in iraq right now second should required viewing for any soldier setting foot there
i actually like this movie alot even though it is geared against the republicans . to bad president in democrate
one of my all-time favorites just for sheer entertainment . michael douglas is at his best in this type film and annette bening was perfect as co-star
this movie was excellent ! the american president had it all- good plot , great acting and directing by rob reiner . i origionally thought that michael douglas given his filmmaking history playing in movies like fatal attraction would not be a choice to play president- but boy wrong he brought sense of charm film j fox as paranoid louis rothschild martin sheen also aj annette benning have such chemistry together on screen
michael douglas was great . this is an excellent movie
a sure winner......if you dont like this movie then i think are from earth ! michael douglas and annette bening fantastic the chemistry they had in was really great wonderful story , acting lot of laughs
i'm with atomicsox -- this is not a comedy and was intended as one . it's movie to be enjoyed some people can only enjoy or tv show that parrots their own views ; they miss great deal along the way , i think
what an underrated movie . michael douglas and annette benning are both perfectly cast as the president his girlfriend , script is so well written i heard that when aaron sorkin first wrote would have run about 3 hours or he cut it down in all of right spots funny with several laugh out loud parts intelligently this also isn't a typical romantic comedy appeals to men much women it's on tnt once month but do yourself favor if you haven't seen spend $4 bucks rent good
i almost passed this movie by but was very pleasantly surprised ! good cast and funny . steve martin provides constant laughs entertainment not one boring bit in the whole of films that watch over
at first , i too was in the boat of saying hey this isn't a comedy but what else is it ? it's funny to be drama not scary enough suspense...it's closest fit . categories aside loved my all-time favorite way for tommy bust on scene
a great movie . however , i would not categorize this coming of age as comedy
this is a really fun movie . the premise of high school kid being left in charge house good to begin with and then delivers above beyond what promised
classic 80s movie which i love
every teenage boy's fantasy .
the subway scene is great who wouldn't like that
superb! ! that's the only word i can say to describe this movie . have seen it 2 times willem defoe , what man is not gorgeous but he act too! scene where runs out chopper barely alive excellent!
its a great movie if you don't take yourself too seriously . this is not meant to awe with the acting it make smile and laugh in that respect success
love it !
this movie is one of the greatest friendship comedies ever . romy white (mira sorvino) and michelle weinburger (lisa kudrow) were outcasts in high school now 10 years later , they're fun-loving ladies who go to dance clubs only problem their year reunion afraid lives great new looks aren't impressive enough watch for actresses janeane garofalo as morbid heather mooney elaine hendrix lisa camryn manheim hyper-spazz toby film about true being yourself not that it's hilarious !
such a great movie about true friendship . i can never get tired of this movie- it is so funny and 90's- you'll love ! the acting surprising good not bad story line either can't wait for my 10 year reunion in years to pull invented post-it line- we'll see who falls
i don't know why , but loved this movie . probably because the blond geeky girls who are actually beautiful kind of reminded me myself
a classic
gripping , violent depressing yet very watchable . the internal civil war between barnes and elias is fascinating a groundbreaking film in history of movies great casting- all actors are terrific
this is one of my favorite movies ! it celebrates friendship and opens our eyes to things we might not have realized about own lives .
oh , it's the backbrace girl ! hi shut up1 this movie i can watch over and . just too funny makes fun of shallow high schoolers who course don't get ha
this has to be one of my favorite movie .
this is one of my favourite movies . lisa kudrow fantastic , as well the oscar-winning mira sorvino it a classic-humoured most entertaining movie that you can watch again and stupid but that's what makes funny laugh also allows u to dream wish about your high school future reunions will be like (a bit inspiration if like) overall exceptional must c great 4 rainy day
you will howl with laughter when bill murray runs over that kid's bike .  .one of the best comedies you've never seen .how can not love a movie high-school kid doing his teenage version 'serpico' as school play ?
so good that i wouldn't dare try to quantify it . however , one thought occurred me was all of the main characters in story - boy bill murray woman even womans dead husband were same character mind but different bodies at ages explained their attractions each other
platoon is one of the best vietnam movies made . while i was seriously considering giving it 4 stars , aka good decided to give 5 because isn't just it's great fact that oliver stone in war himself makes much more believable a haunting experience really delivers acting sheen's performance as dafoe's and berenger's recommend this highly certainly deserved picture oscar must-see summary : 3rd 'nam movie brilliant
an amazing movie . funny , sad weird - i loved everything about from the dark role that bill murray played to odd soundtrack ridiculous scene when all little kids are dressed like wizards throwing rocks at bullies this is not necessarily a feel good but it's also tries be powerful by being depressing just flick really moving
i love this movie ! it was funny , had some great parodies and made me laugh at least every five minutes . definitly a teenie bopper but still all around my brother nad have endless inside jokes - so shows you how film is
another cool war movie . the music is awsome , i've loved adagio for strings a long time very emotional and twisted i love those kind of movies
the best movie in world . highly recomended
this one is great!da bomb!anyone who i think doesn't like it has no sense of humor and most likely to be boring cause hey if you dont laugh at movie never will !
i love it ! can't wait for the sequel
a movie so real it can almost be catagorized as horror film . the brutality , lose of innocence and lack compassion for ones fellow man how being put in center hell tear your soul mind completley apart this is one most heartwrenching interesting films ever made true classic that will hold forever with it's incredible depiction vietnam war highly recommended
i thought it was funny . marlon and shawn wayans were !
i laughed out loud more often than in any movie i've seen years . plan to buy this one
this is a hilarious movie . it's one of my favourites the way it takes piss out movies such as i know what you did last summer and scream really comical definitely worth watch
great comedy . i loved this movie hella funny , especially the boy in bathroom with a weenie stuck his ear
its was a great film , but is better if you see the movies it based in for to get best laughs . haven't seen yet what are you7 waiting
hysterically funny and stupid . marlon shawn did a good job with their mockery of current hit movies already out great acting also
i thought it was a great movie . very well writen , raunchy and funny it's perfect movies for us teenagers ;)
it was soooooo funny and stupid at the same time!! ! i loved so often watch horror flicks all while thinking these people are when they should be running like crazy , stick around to get killed but thats why its a movie liked scary because made fun of how films go . as far everyone getting uptight about showing penises c'mon weren't real were rubber or something we see boobs butts time no one freaks out wayans brothers rule
when you watch this movie will be shocked at what is actually shown . they show provacative stuff and the audience laughing because kind of that not on television unless it porn overall , hilarious
thsi movie is for our younge viewers and hilarious
very funny . includes great sarcasm from all the horror movies
i gave platoon a great rating because the movie was very well directed . from actors that played roles , to storyline it all good this is one of my favorite movies
this movie was really good . there non-stop comedy and portrayal of old movies i especially like the referral to sixth sense
the director decided to make fun of all movies from scream and i know what you did last summer . movie is so funny because they switch whole theme about it even made sixth sense thought he was smoking something that him see dead people
this is the funniest movie i've seen in a long time .
dumb and funny . carmen electra ! reminds me of hotshots loaded weapon
this movie was really funny because it hit off a lot of other movies and made fun them .
funny as hell !
this movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen.it really funny.but don't let your litle kids watch it there some disgusting parts but overall thismovie rocks .
platoon was a movie about vietnam . the showed good portrayal of how war for soldiers it had plenty action and violence which is entertaining
aaaahahahahahahaha!!! ! i thought this movie was sooooo funny either way just laughed the whole time . it doent even need a good story to , love movies that u dont have try unsolve anything can sit there and laugh for like an hour or however long is mean soo all other parts were so stupid lmao worth seeing in theatres
i love scary movie it was the best ever think should get a 10 ! but little bad with sexual content,violence,drug use language.but still rocks .
this is a great movie for anyone with slightly rough sense of humor . it takes the recent glut teen horror movies and spoofs them all...successfully gets on occasion its stereotypes slurs , but those an easy going nature will enjoy lot
i thought the wayans brothers were very funny . they do good movies it was to me because think it's targeted for teenage boys like how made fun of a bunch other
best movie on earth . appropriate for all ages very funny gets guys girls whazzup ?
this classic view on war is my first experience with the grotesqueness of . realities what was about and it meant to those trying survive through gives you a new appreciation for life
this movie was hella funny . i laughed throughout the whole wayans bros are plot stupid but they made fun of all scary movies and it cool
this movie to me earned every point it got from . it's funny and actor in film played their part very well overall , the should have rating of 9 or 10 you would agree if saw (i see dead people)
scary movie was a very humorous poke at the horror industry . it also alluded to many popular movies that everyone has seen target audience catered well
probably the best of vietnam war movies . oliver stone is a bit wingnut , but this movie his crowning achievement used own experiences in to bring an uncanny realism film
i thought it was the funniest movie of summer ; they way clowned all other phony ass scary movies .
this movie was very funny . i think it clever of them to make a based on the current scary movies that are out they did good job and should release in theaters again
this is the funniest movie in world . if you love to make fun of people who get screwed up on drugs , then your i trying act stoned
funny as hell . i saw it three times each time got better
this movie was hilarious . it kept me laughing the did a really good job making fun of other movies and added comedy great
i liked this movie because it kept me laughing the whole time . way they made fun of all sorts movies , and like wayans brothers
best action flick ever,especially when it was released seen this movie so many times my old vhs tape literally wore out(no word of a lie)
i liked this movie because it was hella funny . managed to make fun of or incorporate all the scary movies and put in one also cool stuff totally unexpected
i thought it was really funny and unpredictable who the killer .
it was a funny comedy . made me laugh all the way through had good characters and great plot
the bomb ! wouldn't want to bring your mom though . sometimes it seems inappropriate for kids too spoofs were definitely funny and extremely thought out usually of other movies don't match but this movie's plot really flowed
this is a raunchy movie . there are enough penis jokes for three movies the funniest of year with its blockbuster sales
the daddy of genre and still a million light years ahead pale imitations from stallone , van damme segal etc . works on tv even after umpteenth viewing that's test quality alan rickman's villain has got to be one best bad guys
another great movie i saw this summer . keenan ivory wayans knows how to make a comedy , all the in tear it up and carmen electra looks hot
the movie began itself with a humorous sight . it was basically funny from beginning to end director did great job making fun of other movies
this was my favorite movie of all-time until terminator 2 : judgment day came out . not bad for a runner-up
this movie was hilarious . although it a bit demented (even for me , captain inappropriate) made laugh and succeeded in spoof of recent flicks very clever funny
this has got to be the funniest film that i've seen in years . story was great and some of scenes are so gross they kind disgusted me yet it is still funny as hell i recommend movie anyone a must see
great spoof of all the scary movies . just silly stuff to make you laugh love goofy things stereotypes , good old trash talking humor
great funny movie , it makes fun of almost every you can think . good cast and jokes
who ever chose terrible are fuc#$#$ stupid
this is the best movie after don't be a menace .
this is the funniest movie i have ever seen although dropping of male sex organs off-putting it still excellent!!!!! !
spoofs arre also usually dumb . the wayan's brothers however were able to catch essence of movies without making it outright
this is a hilarious movie ! though not for the squeamish or those without sense of humor even questionable jokes about stereotypes . definitely funniest i have ever seen
the wayans brothers have done it again with their parody on recent horror movies to hit theaters . very similar style of earlier movie , don't be a menace.. is funny from beginning end warning : contains lot sexual content
if somebody woulda hired some marines to take care of that little a hole bruce willis instead stupid forigners he wouldnt be so hard die ! i wish was my father
this was another laugh your butt off comedy ! i guess maybe am in love with movies .
my very favorite movie of all time !
great movie !
