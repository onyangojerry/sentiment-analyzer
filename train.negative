i did not see this movie nor am likely to . it looked so stupid think the paper gave no stars
stupid . an unsucessful attempt at a parody i'm just glad i wasn't one of the people that actually paid to see this but didn't keep me from wanting time wasted watching it back or brain cells lost while
stupid ! i wish we could give a 0 rating
a lot of money was thrown away here .
hmmm...well i'm not a chick-flick person , so i didn't like it .
this movie stinks , its pretentious arty fartsy crap! ! avoid it at all cost .
couldn't wait to leave this movie .
one of the most crapy films i have ever seen . only reason watched it was because there nothing else on and regret
boring ! no plot , and not funny
ok...now let's add this to our top 10....worst movies of all time .
i found this film to be a disappointment . is measured not only in my view of the , but also that two daughters who it quite lackluster there was entirely too much adult (sex) humour for directed at kids personally don't care lowest common denominator : gee bear has gas and his poop stinks har bad enough directing away question about what oral sex thanks bill clinton now have kid asking an action shot guess after klumps should known expect ; heck from eddie's early comedy act movie slow weak nothing makes you really happens sorry baaaaad
should be called intolerable boredom . me and the missus fell asleep through large portions of it it's a comedy devoid humor -- very mean spirited one at that worst offerings ever by brothers coen
this affront to the ocular palette should be burned before viewing . if you like coen brothers , then maybe you'll find some amusement here however enjoy well done movies with a good plot acting and cinematography is not place go only saving grace was katherine
just too sad .
because of the titland scene
very poorly done .
totally lame ! i can't believe they bothered to make this movie .
bad hollywood remake off of the cartoon .
one of the worst movies i've ever seen
tried to watch this but i could not bring myself do it . how bad can a movie get was truely terrible
i like just about every movie see , but not this one ! it sucked the plot laughed 1 time maybe . don't
simply put , this one isn't true to the cartoon at all ! instead it ignores great that was its inspiration and relies on crutch of cliches make up typical teen comedy movie . let's see that's profanity disrespectful attitudes from protagnoists sex jokes believe me watch it's even got a laugh track
comedy , no . accurate representation of karaoke subculture way well-written ixnay engaging only the storyline about man who quits his job and goes crazy ; but - it went down tubes promise was broken
lousy movie i didn't find it funny at all
omg , could you have made a worse movie ? who's idea was this why????
unless you enjoy watching a grumpy , drunk jerk say the f word every 5 minutes then i do not recommend this movie . billy bob plays such miserable character it makes painful to watch in last scene when he tries redeem himself its too little late and seems way unlikely that loser would finally develope any sort of compassion dont waste your time
terribly offensive movie full of bad role models , extremely raunchy humor and even worse the great santa claus is turned asunder . not recommended in slightest
i am not offended by much...just bad movies ! this movie sucked was soooo prepared to laugh . the on me! ,
does anyone remember children ? yes i realize this is an adult movie , but those ubiquitous ads are seen by all day long . in age of absent parenting and single mothers de jour go pop some adults bubble leaves the kids alone !
compared to the first one i think this movie was just aweful . even by itself it's still annoying pacing way too fast and humor obnoxious at least somewhere in vicinity of trying be believable when went , thought she gonna running for office - that woulda been a better story idea where she's next phase her life tackling obstacles fighting battles level tests maturity but no they basically did repeat goes new place sorority-mad perkiness is scoffed eventually accepted through hard work good-heartedness word it lame
dumbest movie ever released with a bunch of stupid stereo types . if your iq is low you are gonna love this show
just awful ! has danny devito ever made a satisfying movie ? characters totally unbelievable , and robin (who i like) having total character reversal at the end after going in circles throughout whole ( i'll kill him oh now love pleeeze!) liked norton but what was deal with jon stewart what's point of all vulgarity i'm not prude it's funny anymore . any 'comedy' that you can count number laughs (two) problem even worthy blockbusters leftover table
this movie was totally gross , and filled with so much filth that i could barely watch until the ending . thought prince albert scene repulsive as well save your time money don't ever piece of trash if you know what is good for you.....i shocked christina applegate would have chose such a role...
bad sequel to overrated movie . disney should be ashamed shameless raven cameo
omg why is this even here , they should have held the premiere at a blockbuster
uninteresting , unfunny and unwatchable movie .
not the greatest movie by any means . i personally thought goldie hawn was totally overacting and no where near her best susan sarandon couldn't even pull it off , think she trying these two women just don't have that chemistry is required in types of movies didn't really like storyline well either save your money waste time with this one..
lopez has no talent .
this was a comedy?? ? wow , must have missed that.. .
tom hank's worst !
had it been a bunch of b-movie hacks , maybe i would give 2 stars . but considering that the coen brothers steven soderburgh and tom hanks involved this movie squandered all star power in very unfunny mess few laughs marlon wayans did was launch lines like f--- f---ing mother f---er you after while gets on your nerves know wouldn't find funny even if juvenile delinquent hood my wife turned off complained can we turn before dozing about third through miscast probably his worst role since bosom buddies an absolute waste time stinkers intolerable cruelty simply suck
third-rate remake of a truly great original movie . tom hanks put in his usual unconvincing performance , and this case that bogus southern accent he tortured the audience with was really annoying crass broad vulgar attempt at humor peter sellers alec guinness must be thrashing about wildly their tombs
jennifer aniston still sucks .
very funny bit by hank azaria as the french scuba instructor. . and jennifer aniston fine otherwise this thing reeks someone should stop ben stiller from making movies
it was so frikin predictable ! there were only a few mildly amusing moments . three words people : oh dear god
kate hudson still sucks .
will ferrell is one of the worst actors to ever come out snl , and this movie proves once again . script be very lame i did not find scene remotely funny
stinker . the scream series does a much better job at satirizing horror genre scary movie 2 (or 1 , or 3 for that matter) in essence satire of has all groaners and very few chuckles raunchy too
one word : obscene ! i'm not a puritan , but i thought the sex jokes were revolting . imagine that in italy it's rated g ....and parents will rent it for their 10-year-old children problem is isn't even funny at all..
like the trash heap that is american pie series , this movie never deserved to be made either . once again sex jokes are used as a crutch just attract teens when parody and comedy can executed well in clean ways don't even get paid watch it !
the title says pretty much all you need to know about this waste of space called a movie  ! too long , boring and just totally pointless.. .
what was the climax of this stupid movie . where jason biggs says f word to shock 9 years olds that were watching it ? or when punches dude in library and then becomes hero guy definately aimed at 8-11 year so they can brag there friends saw a pg-13 terribly falls flat no jokes (or least good ones) , nothing new blah
horrible casting . none of them could have ever been losers because the look too pretty plot stunk like rotting flesh best scene is dream sequence in credits
loser was a bad movie . i glad to go home it slow and not funny at all hate this film with passion
the word that comes to mind when describing this film is miscasted . christina ricci seems absolutely disassociated from her character often there no passion behind speech , even role of a severely disturbed person she obviously supposed have bulimia but mood swings and intensity come with them are where be found autism would suit portrayal amanda better then in word- wooden jason biggs who plays jerry about as authentic comfortable his actors late-night paid programming ads he simply cannot play part intellectual troubled writer acts same did american pie- an eager befuddled socially inapt young adult trying become world before himself it was source comedy anything else merely detracted not one scenes or bits dialogue seemed believable both may able pass buck woddy allen's screen writing pretentious verbiage like suitable for dawson's creek : college years cheap tool bad instead developing characters into intellectuals just use big words small little ones additionally waxed philosophical obnoxiously wasn't subtle at all overt guy nudging you going do ya get ? existentialism ! if only had contained any interesting existential themes worth noting been more bearable reduced name dropping pondering on fact humans we confront our own mortality sprinkle sarte dash camus neither insightful effective nor amanda's eating disorder very well done beginning obvious has really can said none acknowledge does serve purpose furthering narrative making drama complex compelling reasonable conclusion audience people know which it's doesn't build many such loose ends movie while majority terrible irony crap i must say were some good things danny devito playing jerry's manager best actor job ; funny entertaining- also great gems mostly spoken by dubelle (allen) useless trivia (not spoiler)- end says guess dubelle's seminal joke stopped clock right twice day bit actually whitnail unless first written somewhere (1987) juxtaposition lines cerebrally comical
if , like tarantino you find humour in murder and torture then you're one sick mutha who needs pyschiatric help pronto . why this film has become so iconic i dont know it's cretinous rubbish
vin diesel needs to be deported .
it is just boring .
adam sandler sucks !
i am a huge adam sandler fan , which is why went to see this movie . however was terribly disappointed at the gross stupidity of it not even one those movies that so stupid it's funny humor disgusting and definately poor representation sandler's talent as an actor producer would have given film rating 0 if were option
???? ?
movies like this should not even be allowed to maid . weed that makes you smarter sorry , but point wouldn't escape snoop after 40 blunts
dude-this movie sucked !
more like... . dude , why did i bother watching this ? mindless thoughtless juvenile junk a waste of time ! don't
somebody shoot the producer of this sh*t .
'kay , very possibly one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen . it wasn't even stupid like was funny just sat there for two hours literally feeling my brain go numb from pointless tatoo banter and stoned guys trying to some sort coherent conversation failing miserably
ashton kutcher . that explains everything i still like the and then thing but he can take no credit for
nasty violent movie , walked out of the theater half way through !! ! glorifying and laughing at killing people sick
worst movie ever .
the worst movie i've ever seen (though parts of trailer were funny) .
i'm a fan of ashton kutcher and even i couldn't stomach this idiocy . what was wrose how many inane catchphrases it created waste film reel with nothing redeemable about
are you kidding me ? lol  ! this thing should be in the $1.00 bargain bin at blockbuster . get real
dude wheres the dumb
i went to a free advanced screening of this film , and was still tempted walk out after the first 10 minutes demand refund . movie ad-libbed by class 3rd graders would have been more entertaining one at least able understand where writers were coming from whole plot revolves around two moronic stoners trying figure what happened them previous night ; they can't remember because incredibly high wasted stupid can only assume makers through exact process woke up found had produced abomination even people (including myself) who enjoy movies that are so they're funny will find themselves nauseated insulted brief exposure comedic black hole hope those responsible for inflicting world with dude where's my car ? very sorry poor covered honey fire ants
title alone says it all.. .
painful . couple of funny scenes (that showed up in the trailer) , but not worth a minute your life or dollar money
i frigging hated it . expected total hiliarity , but think maybe laughed once...then again could have been gas the story line was weak at best and kicked myself for actually paying money to rent
seriously one of the worst movies i've ever seen . only reason i continued watching it was beautiful ashton
i personally thought this movie was absolutly pathetic . the only way you can enjoy is to be stoned about losing a car on night of being trashed and trip retrievel they stumble upon clues what did last who really cares where thier can't believe even payed see someone shoot me ! think whole time laughed once ruined every joke by out doing themselves , too much stupid acting for simple little jokes
incredibly stupid movie . i can't believe anyone would pay to see this , let alone get paid make crap like about fifteen minutes was all could take usually can myself sit through a but even have my limits complete waste of time
how ed asner decided to do this movie , i'll never know . but aside from that it's stupid disrespectful and of course sick at times avoid
crappy and totally unfunny comedy .
foolish,ignorant and totally horrible.what was the budget on this film , 100k?how long did it take writers to come up with crap ?
what a piece of crap made for the amusement people who have low enough iq to appreciate . it was bad when they first one now there are two sequals next i want see would be last friday
definitely should've stopped with the first one . this was just dreadful , and next sequel friday after will probably be as bad
a waste of time .
pathetic follow up film for gere and roberts . not that pretty woman was any good , itself..
pathetic .
this movie brought back so many bad memories its not even funny . one's worth the $6.50 yankee fans
i never saw this movie but the stupid plot and a title say it all , don't see it's .
boy , did i make a mistake renting this movie . should have known better after reading the recommendation on back of box that suggested i'd like nurse betty (i walked out theater during ) anyway steve martin and thought novocaine looked an enjoyable dark comedy three major complaints about show first plot got off to pretty good start but it never went anywhere in addition actions martin's character were totally unbelievable my opinion found myself grumbling husband throughout finally is disturbing pictures mind rather not as result don't even think wasting your time one
i hate the movie
adam sandler sucks !
for the wovie in history my opinion has to be a tie between this movie and mr maggoo anybody agree ?
possibly the worst piece of crap ever made . some adam sandler's movies are funny , such as happy gilmore and big daddy but this movie was ridiculous
way,way,overrated and overhyped just like the kill bill movies.warped twisted every other film tarantino does,but when you have a mind what else can do?i challenge to make another genre of movies.if he truely has talent (which i doubt)it will show .
not even worth taking out on video !
is adam sandler crazy ? he not that cute or charming to make this load of crap sell . personaly i have , nor will see piece garbage the only thing thats funny related movie are ticket sales hey you thought about driving a city bus as new career now that's
chris rock is the lead actor in film . nuff said
robert deniro must need money . eddie murphy couldn't be then , go see the movie plays a career cop who wants to an actor rene russo is producer gets 2 of them on film but it's not that good skip this one
perhaps one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen .
chris kattan sucks .
ouch .
what? ! i want battlefield earth two . not this
this movie was absolutely terrible . whatever you do , don't waste your money on junk! !
i know garfield and this isn't it . it's just a boring , generic anaemic kids movie looks like c*** most of the acting is poor (especially jennifer love hewitt who acts so forced) plot not true to comic for example hates odie he doesn't become friends with him does here liz also jon any date they went on in strip was disaster each other only acceptable performance from bill murray as villain kiddy i've seen thousand times over acted out such rescue both unoriginal unexciting rest animals are normal which kind cheap related by name (for arlene appear be garfield's girlfriend) conclusion if you're fan don't see : could have been interesting watch but hate 1/5 stars - you've warned
i didn't actually sit down for this movie , but working at a theater saw enough of it . refuse to reward jim davis' next effort over-commercialize his characters and grab more money with than one star mean the garfield comic's storyline isn't complicated would have been so difficult stay true ? nermal is cute gray kitten arlene tall white having liz give in jon's affections completely butchers personalities both tough all animal be cgi not just
this has got to be the absolute worst movie i have ever seen!!! ! could not believe producers would put out something awful . there was none of that humor makes garfield comic strips so funny no kicking crap odie , humorous jokes about jon nothing lacked substance it really did rather lost $8.50 spent on ticket streets somewhere than sit for an hour and half forced watch mess because don't like waste money hated film!! least they done make animated as well then maybe some things they're known doing each other but you tell sh*t low-budget acting terrible set cast plot ridiculous (odie gets kidnapped by a tv show host he can dance guy wants him co-host sets rescue him) at end ends up with liz vet now never happen in actual strip stupid!! am ranting here actually big fan own several books full them i've bought posters works feel critic represent what is all pathetic
another attempt at a bret easton ellis novel being made into movie , and yet failure . why can't they find good director screen writer or even producers to make one of his books that is actually worth watching ? it complete travesty i very surprising would allow be butchered so massively without any care in the world almost cried by how horrible this was....you better off reading trust me
this movie was just plain stupid . it the worst i have ever seen insipid and moronic don't waste your time , people it's not a good
please don't see this movie .
this looks retarded .
if your not going to get jim carrey or jeff daniels , then don't make the movie . there also was way much of a storyline
i wish we could rate topics in the negatives , would have to this a -5 then . plot was joke thank god jim carrey and jeff daniels didn't accept sequel it still sucked
actually , if bob saget's cameo was the only humourous thing about this movie that should tell you how horrendous it truly is . just a horrible waste of space...why anyone would money on beyond me..
hill , you bet this movie is good ? should really see a before review it . know what they say about people who assume..
was this really necessary ?
harry and lloydd should shoot the director of this film . first one was hilarious then they go ruin it in second i can't believe that spent $20 to see , think excited bummer what a disappoinment !
this movie should have never been made . it gaves harry and lloyd a bad name
please take away the pain. .
i had to be dragged into the theater see this one . wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece or anything , but did it have that painfully bad ? first was better (and that's not saying much obviously) jokes were lame (again much) storyline terrible just movie lives up its title all right so guess it's false advertising at least
brittany murphy sucks .
i like a film that makes some sense - this did not! !
horrible . i didn't buy the whole poor-me-cinderella act on hilary duff it work nothing about this movie worked unless you're 12
trash . waste of money , time and space period martin lawrence is a sitcom actor only his series was funny very but acting in practically all movies has been pretty terrible to me i do like him though just not
the worst movie ever . lawerence can't act , period
the best i can figure out for this barrel of offal is that wayans brothers wanted a vehicle to poke fun at white people's sensitilities and play off against various stereotypes . strictly fare morons cretins ; but hey , they need their entertainment also !
ignorance.anyone who wastes money even renting this movie should do a serious mental evaluation .
one of those films where the violent scenes appeared to have been written by an emotionally disturbed person,who'd never seen anything .
shockingly bad . i went in with high expectations and left wanting to sue the theater for my money back realize support cast carried romano on everybody loves raymond , but you really get feeling of how much a dud he is when suffer through this flick
i like these actors....usually . i'm a fan of ray romano and gene hackman but wasted my money it is the writing script really bad
freebird is right about one thing ; i am glad only rented this . very boring , and extremely disorganized ray romano's comic talents quickly gave way to a poorly written script cliched jokes politicians didn't even know which route for in that election neither seemed any better or worse than the other
cynical tripe .
did anyone actually go to the theater see this dreck ? if so , they need therapy . i saw it on cable and appears be some kind of spin-off from rock's hbo gig dreadful !
america is totally f***ked when sh*t like this produced for mass consumption .
wonderful heart warming family film . you'll laugh , cry want you'r f*cking money back! ! what a stinky piece!!!!
it sucked big time !
a sequel .
walking into this mess .
oh lord , this was bad . the only thing that would have made it worse is having sandler schneider or carrey in cast
well , i have one thing to say . this movie sucked
kangaroo jack is one of those horrible films that the perfect candidate for raspberry awards . it's horrid to see these two hasbeen actors as a bunch drunk buddies always nice christopher walken , but he has no material work with does not talk exception long and obnoxious dream sequence which an excuse put move over 80 minutes
the worst movie of all time . it's so bad that not even funny what idiot decided to spend money make this piece crap ?
are you kidding ? is this drivel a movie i watched ten minutes of crap at my son-in-laws house , before got up and went into another room . tom greene should be put away forever for being total moron
absolutely disgusting movie . it's a total gross-out with no plot whatsoever
easily one of the worst movies all time . crude humor , bad language and tons disrespect around tom green should be arrested
marrying drew barrymore did not help his movie career .
i don't think have ever seen physical comedy come off any worse . was actually too embarassed to watch this film with anyone else , and while that tom green is funny he obviously must be controlled palatable for large audiences unless you like animal masturbation humor rent
i was genious with this rating because couldnt give 0 stars . awful disgusting movie snuck in to and still wanted my back tom green stick pissing off people on the street
i haven't seen this but was told that the message you get at end is joke on for paying to see movie ! good one tom....i guess .
why even have this on the list . it's a zero !
barbershop 3 : give it up
one was enough ! please stop
who are these apologists ? the critics were right to trash this dog of a movie .
hoolywood hyped it as a great movie , maybe thats what doomed !
this was a comedy ? i guess the joke getting studio to front money for wretched garbage .
this stinker was so far below dustin hoffman it is hard to imagine what he thinking when agreed take the part . beatty , on other hand another story entirely film only slightly above plan 9 from outer space - and in ed wood's defense at least had excuse of a low budget
this is a zero , period....no further comment exxcept i have bridge in brooklyn for the producer who fell pathetic carcature of script.. .
this should have come with a warning . no iq's over 80 permitted
this movie is absolutely awful . it deserves no stars truly , sucks !
another tom green movie that i will never see . who watches this crap and why do the studios keep giving people money to make movies with local paper also gave one no stars if could would note hollywood send back canada
all madonna had to do was play a version of herself and she couldn't even that .
way too far fetched . the judge had a roller coaster in his back yard , enough said
nothing this man spits out can be mistakened as comedy . isn't an exception
extremely terrible movie is what describes 'soul plane' . it was not only because of the lack a real plot , nor fact that cast could act if their lives depended on ; plain dumb funny whatsoever and everyone ought to be insulted by this horrific piece trash as plays worst possible stereotypes often attributed minorities especially african americans an embarrassment all moviedom period
how this ever got to the theaters is beyond me . no bankable stars and a stupid plot black movies were set back by garbage
this is one of 3 movies that i have walked out in midshow . piece junk should never been created it senseless violence , and really has no storyline worth mentioning the scene male rape was disgusting what broke camels back you can believe theatre gave our money as we left weren't only ones quentin tarantino possibly worst directors all time well do not recommend movie to anyone will leave feeling dirty sick just bad if watch also made me lose tons respect for john travolta rosanna arquette bruce willis..
not even worth being on this list.while i am here anyway , it gets two thumbs way down and a fat 1!! !
absolutely terrible movie . retched not worth anything at all
what a stupid idea for movie .
this sucked donkey balls
i don't understand why they felt had to make this again when it has already been made memorable in gene wilder's film . and a classic version was too
although i am the biggest john travolta fan who ever lived , hated this movie so much ! didn't understand any of it and thought john's look was a disgrace to magnificent handsome face god gave him only enjoyed one part that when he dancing with uma . can't say acting bad by actors but story just way beyond my understanding...however know in minority because all people i've talked they very
a mentally ill creep passes judgement on children in this creepy movie . the fat kid is despised and reviled simply for enjoying chocolate he never even gets chance to show his personality because he's first go singers call him disgusting repulsive no wonder kids at school have double rate of suicide attempts ! why it ok hurt ?
please e-mail me with suggestions , stories or lies to help get out of taking my wife see this movie .  .she's already mentioned it and i need an escape plan hurry !
more special fx and fantasy tosh...isn't hollywood fed up with all this vacuity yet ? so it brings in the dollars...but let's get some warming , real-life stories !
unless you need to take kids a relatively clean movie , i would avoid kicking and screaming . i'm told it's comedy but didn't laugh almost walked out of the theater 20 minutes into because it was so boring unfortunately stayed never got any better save your money see something anything else
jeesus h . christ , i hated this movie it's been a long time since wanted to walk out on film within the first fifteen minutes wait minute  no it hasn't there was "the constant gardener" yuck anyway back turd in question storyline had one gimmick good premise that went nowhere so story sucked but wasn't worst thing about milf every second she screen more seriously contemplated mad dash for door plain awful her overly melodramatic shrewlike smarmy dialouge bad enough i'll give credit decent performance fault casting director and screenwriter seemed be actress guess hard act your way of wouldn't know fact don't damn making movies except when see simply didn't buy idea "mom" sixteen year old son five daughter hips like seventeen girl needless say makeup & hair were always perfect yeah right major pet peeves mine i'm sick hollywood's version regular folks who look as though they stepped spiegel catalog only enjoyed flashed beaver ummm gotta ask just what hell all ? hey into 69'ing cheerleaders rough sex stairway expecting either particular at least not where put them from those angles set "tender moments" soundtrack hot scenes besides being place tooooo music aaaarghhhh ! mean if watching people bump grind expect some bowmp-ba-bowmp or screetching guitars bolero anything sappy hallmark week elevator god need drink
mindless and very boring movie that really goes nowhere quickly .
found the movie very crude and demeaning to women . good message at end but u have waste an hour half get it i'm open-minded , don't offend easily as are my friends....but i dont know anyone who liked was just a really bad movie..poor taste major of 10 bucks!!! ! american pie much better!! ur money!!!
i could never watch this movie . saw the trailer for it , and couldn't don't get scared easily but it's when i'm in bed with lights out that everything watched during day comes back to haunt me was terrified three days after just watching like demonic movies because unlike normal horror is actually real happen
i only went to see that nasty skank die.. . ((paris))
sucks
erf , me and my boyfriend went to this movie just make out seeing as it was soo boring. .
i was bored , looking for a quick laugh . didn't find any laughs with this movie recycled plots poor direction and the cinema had 15 minute rule if you walk out in first minutes get your money back know walked after about 20 of don't waste time or kranks..
jennifer lopez still sucks .
another victim to the hollywood remake trend . charlize theorn made an awful aeon flux costume is worst i prefer cartoon over movie
i fell asleep while watching this
very stupid movie . horrible voice-overs plot not worth renting or mentioning
it's a waste of money . i thought it was gonna be good cause the famous voices for animals boy wrong , audience only laughed once and wasn't fall chair laugh just simple ha warned ya
i can't believe they dragged out krik douglas' corpse to make a few bucks . shame on them
well , it was a good start to the new brangelina movement . they got make out in movie and not feel extremely guilty about all scripted...or so we think
hated it .
doesn't matter who angelina's currently spreading her legs for in hollywood...she still sucks .
unfortunately , a complete disappointment . i have been fan for years but this just didn't work...i felt was watching differnt film entirely why change successful format ?
ouch . painful ! allowing myself to be dragged see this at the theater is on my top ten lists of regrets in fact , tombstone will probably read : "one regret" dr kryptic i'm assuming there were no parachutes board
despite the fact that i watched this movie on a flight from boston to sfo , was so bad still thought about walking out it . used like will farrell but now after 29 movies over three years has become apparent how one-dimensional and unoriginal he really is he's same character in every most recently they have all been nicole kidman at least little (very little)likable she drops my opinion -- guilt by association what thinking taking role ? one of worst ever
my word to describe this movie : unnecessary . between what is truly entertaining and a pure waste of time , there line kinsey crossed it definitely i was interested at first because the sweet honest romance his wife shared their naivity about sex cute but remainder took beautiful thing shat (is that word?) all over image lliam neeson forever ruined
 . this is one of those ones where you're gonna either love it or hate i'm in the latter camp okay , so i haven't seen rob zombie's previous move house 1000 corpses ; did figure yeah probably going to be a little bizarre violent whatever can deal with that. besides my husband really wanted see he's type who likes that stuff violence but don't appreciate pointless much mean there wasn't plot : crazy possibly-imbred psycho family gets hunted down by equally psychotic sheriff if fairly sensitive depictions sexual movie definately isn't for you was just scene seriously actually vomit (which feat there's only other made me want throw up also has distinction being few i've walk out of) and what's worse people theater were laughing wtf ? know what disgusted at more that's fault should've done some research before walking into i'll take full responsibility care pushed extremes on nudity profanity it's never been doesn't make good all go ahead buy dvd knock yourself least better now skip any future zombie flicks
pathetic .
what an utter disappointment , there is no comparison between this tripe and the original (which a remake of superior japanese version) . had genuine atmosphere inventive cinematography real suspense film quality very standard time around lacks high contrast grainy first that added to main protagonist hasn't gained any more intelligence since movie in fact she complete ditz who needs iq infusion take it out double digits version somewhat excuse as stumbled across origins videotape began realize implications were indications was absent parent needed make connection with her child even absent-minded neglectful warning : spoilers ahead examples 1) right near beginning demonic girl makes appearance by emerging from body bag grabbing mother try pull into netherworld hmmm...you'd think would clue grab kid find police station hospital or some other well-lit public place lots people nope instead leaves alone big empty house while does investigative reporting at all hours night plus they have screen tv their new digs hello ! you after went through avoid being tvs costs gets worse not half way has either left lost him altogether additional 2-3 times example 2) be seeing manifest herself kid's room seep walls takes son romantic interest's house...and bathtub goes for drive loves water ; it's calling card mode transport apparently so naturally on his own again you-know-who don't get me started "scary" computer-animated herd roaming deer yeah that's --- vicious villainous venison oooo spooky one most unintentionally funny moments horror brings screeching halt floatation device ring otherwise save sinker
dissapointing
this movie failed on all levels with me . first of , if you've seen the ring nothing in will surprise you samara isn't nearly as scary one it was far to easy tell when aiden or possession scenes and i didn't think rachel's acting particularly good at any point special effects film are pretty much what got no surprises there two moments though deer attacking car (why rachel just listen keep driving?) bathtub scene he said want take a bath?) those were highlight an otherwise dull unremarkable skip
1 star...in honor of the first chucky . but...why anyone would think that he needs descendants is beyond me
doesn't live up to the trailer . not at all scary don't waste your money , skip this one
writer eric kripke is a hack .
paris hilton in the movie ? that's pathetic ! those who have seen and loved it should be ashamed of yourselves . hollywood brought into a new low big time
every now & then you happen upon a movie like this on hbo or some other 'movie channel' and let me tell -- is about as unwatchable mike myers 'the cat in the hat' .
you couldn't pay me to see this crap
pulp fiction was in a word , brainless . aside from the far to over used gore and shock factor there no point this film i left theater feeling not only stupider for having seen but also wasted $7.50 see it
if there were a marking for zero , i would definatley put it down . as fan of the show i'm little insulted this movie was incredibly lame and jessica simpson made horrible daisy duke
yet , another lousy overrated remake .
sandler was great in punh drunk love , but this one he is just there to get a few extra people pay thier money .
is 'superbabies : baby geniuses 2' stupid ? yes ! perhaps the stupidest film to come out in a long time , idiots who gave go make sequel of originally lame 'baby genuises' ought be tarred and feathered for wasting millions dollars on such worthlessness . this movie like its predecessor has no humor- nor does it have any real meaning short disgrace almost as bad total failure moviedom from years back 'the jerky boys movie' only positive thing about that can't possibly but comes fairly close
i hated this movie because it didn't' make sense and was disgusting . couldn't bare to watch that crap especially when the guy is getting screwed up ass ! turned off all cutting jumping from time didn't
more like stupid babies : baby geniuses 2 . how did this movie get the greenlight ?
let's do the math.....tara reid + christian slater = ?? ?
so bad....that it doesn't even deserve a star . why they let tara reid in anything....is beyond me
i just saw an advance screening of this in toronto , and have to say it is without a doubt one the most ridiculous movies ever seen . while enjoyed xxx found fast furious moderately entertaining for rental that rob cohen has proved himself as having worst eyes detail world.. or he simply does not any other skill except pointing camera shooting first 15 minutes film shows good promise starts off with bang gives you some coolest fighter jet action terms sequences they are certainly best but only saving grace if all care about will probably enjoy brain real military situations science even common sense find be stupidest piece tripe every laid your on give example at point pilot bail out plane (this shown commercials) person would know bailed few seconds pilot's nearly mile away however ejects downwards later blows up raining fiery debris over basic understanding heavy metallic from traveling faster its original direction than falling since did blow instantly directly above falls straight line down onto another fact there so many minor plot threads absolutely no importance overall story like writer needed fill space instead developing decided throw bunch unrelated undeveloped scenes main (which was interesting enough) we get little never add very whole these two examples how badly thought script list actually endless my friend spent second half carving jamie foxx going thanking maker won oscar before released least can still ride success much anybody else involved walk don't waste money want see rent better films spend i'm glad didn't cent
where to begin ? dark water looks like a fun , scary summer movie from every trailer that is shown and i admit looked forward seeing it . but now have sat down taken the hours out of my life watch film feel wasted part for this be frank boring un-scary thought as being along lines (in scares suspense) remake ring found myself disappointed in what watched take place on screen i'm not sure if it's just me dirty gushing faucet 5 min call obviously did nearly entire theater who saw with felt same way many people immediately got their cell phones called others saying how bad was one woman said her (husband presuming) she had been ripped off even though free screening trailers (panic glass breaking direction) all happens within final 15 or 10 worse first hour so dull you loose interest almost completely by time do dare say events occur beginning seems slow paced sad drama at scary/suspenseful thriller ending bizarre pointless mystery unclearly solved we are left thinking happened? director takes his setting up (drawing divorce custody hearings looking through apartment good 20 min. walking around halls riding elevator going school among other things) then when finally care about happening he slams book shut leaves beat fantastic 4 box office because previews interviews now.. after its entirety everyone wondering really : save your money will most likely very end
this film , like all other moore films is funny and entertaining but the facts are grossly distorted . if was to be a lampoon of some sort it would rate higher score as intended facual report that spews lies distortion i give one star won't reward
a few years ago , i believed this garbage . after his later fantasies i'm big fan of general motors !
shrewed guy this michael moore , makes millions selling lies . what's allarming is that many buy the "facts" in his "documentaries"
michael moore can kiss my republican ass .
everyone who rated this movie as great must really be truly blind . shroomwoman is exactly correct in the , mr moore expresses how he cares for victims of columbine about scary whole incident was made millions dollars from documentary and much do you think went to poor terrible tragedy ? $0 suprised shouldn't especially when balmes all wealthy rich people america people's problems yet man didn't give a single dime it anyone but himself god i hate hypocrisy anyway film if can call that nothing moore's own opinion mixed together with political views lies course visits weapons mass destruction facility described reality not making any satellites compares us gun violence australia well other countries only has few hundred vioent crimes while thousands then ask yourself what population vs teh lol ! its little pieces bits information facts are left out just like timeline blames 9-11 that's right watch feel disgrace your stomach did filthy liar trying brainwash into believing his don't fall him supports an idiot tool
i agree with everything shroomwoman and big baby said . michael moore presents an interesting problem : gun violence in america , turns it into illogical immature destructive mockumentary he lies reports false information uses deceipt on other human beings to promote his twisted view of our country this film is dangrous young minds
this whole fake documentary was all made up by michael moore . check out website ! bowlingfortruth.com
more of a propoganda film that anything else . i'm liberal , but i hate when my fellow liberals churn out false to brainwash the masses same for republicans and other politicians michael moore may be smart man he doesn't depict himself properly all does is piss moan about one problem instead adressing every aspect it thing only adresses 4 countries in world gun violence look at some places middle east worse there than america we ought go try help those poor kids also spins things control links makes between what causes it.......jeez opinion poverty overcrowding which mental instability among many
simply put , bowling for columbine is a disaster of movie . i thought it would be at least somewhat thought-provoking and instead found disjointed uninspiring too slanted to taken seriously the jumped around from one issue another with such heavy hand that seemed like joke (and perhaps was) michael moore's interactions along way were extremely annoying kept asking myself why he didn't ask more intelligent questions certainly had some interesting ideas work top off go on forever when see how much acclaim this received i'm baffled it's emperor's-new-clothes phenomenon..
false , contrived and utterly taste less . this corpulent fool is a liar who if he reported the facts of columbine would disprove all his opinions
b.s .
if you had a soldier who was for the war and against it do think would be in this film ? movie is nothing more then political garbage with extreme exagerations bias . anything he has made our nation stupid already should punished such filth
if you want to see the truth about how michael deceived america by editing footage promote his political agenda fahrenhype 9/11.spend 5 minutes reading up on mike and will he has a long comfortable relationship with deceit . can't even tell birthplace says was born in flint , michigan when reality across tracks davison
run far away from anything michael moore writes . the slant he with is unbelievable i find it hard to believe first amendment protects his type , but does betcha framers never saw him coming...betcha they're wretch minute they pile'o'****
pretty clear what the intent was , in that respect film failed to achive its goal.. . for left is
sheer rubbish . an insult to the intelligence a film that punishes you for actually know something
update : say goodbye to america , hope you enjoy your police state ? facts are reav whew . now there lots of things can blame on a public high school education but kool-aid distribution seems little more serious moore's movie is factual even the faithful deaniacs don't try purport that just line up in michael's when he tells it's fact good for i'll remain i voted and bluetar being propaganda doesn't make it false look definition again original comment 3/4/05 this wrong list where crockumentaries rates 5
just one of those movies to get everyone vote for kerry . plus , how could moore know anything about what bush did ? he's a director i only saw the beginning because got bored with it
i'm loving this bulshit . its troops like the ones in iraq and overseas that make it possible for a fat lard moore to flick just disgrace is unbelieveable how people can go along with liberal propaganda believe bush his personal reasons get clue realize we did not elect president who so foolish as fheit movie , poor insight one sided views whomever made needs kill yourself love you michael keep putting out bad movies because republican party loves bash your remember controls senate bill frist
moore makes me want to throw up every time i see him........ .
pure cut and paste.i thought documentaries were based on fact.a look into the mind of hollywood left.they see world as a big picture that is to be directed their taste.even sadder are mindless zombies who believe base arguments this garbage .
documentaries are objective and use facts . this is ultra-liberal propaganda
it's not a documentary.. .
a documentary - really ? i thought it was more of feature length cartoon . ever heard out context creative editing you know , like special effects manipulation get or do believe superman can fly
try fahrenhype 9/11
michael moore is a rabid animal . put him to sleep , please
lies , have you seen gearge bush talk about the men he sent to war hardly a man who did it for political gain .
this should not be listed under documentary....purely fiction trying to sold as truth an unaware public. . lies , misrepresentation and deceitful editing techniques get his blatantly weak points across..
this is not a documentary at all . its moore's distorted facts , half truths and lies that jumbled into one big disasterous propaganda piece because i just don't like him the movie jumps over place from issue to next it was poorly put together does poor job of linking bush saudi arabia saddam he only allowed soldeirs who were against war speak out also said congressman had family member in iraq which lie there are actually 4 them how can anyone take crap seriously ? every time tries get serious quickly ruins with cheap shots jokes bush's bad looks or his speech what mature fair notion given soldiers conservatives supported never once mentions several liberals including mr kerry voted for military action patriot act on occassions mainly reinstitutes information has already been told by everyone else learned nothing new watching instead trying make me support (which entire point film) managed president even more opening worst part saying al gore really won when sore losers left stop thier bitching moaning you lost ! back if moore would have three rating but didn't he's biased an admitted communist no did any money off purchased ticket another seen ive knew current events unfolded simply doing best- making millions deaths innocents awesome pieces joseph goebbels be jumping joy complains enough troops why doesn't sign up huh do fat body some good comment may sound personal attack way hate liars hypocrites love distort american public
christopher hitchens (a lefty , former editor of the nation who is redeemed by being intellectual honest) had best review this film : fahrenheit 9/11 a sinister exercise in moral frivolity crudely disguised as an seriousness . it also spectacle abject political cowardice masking itself demonstration 'dissenting' bravery read whole at http://slate.msn.com/id/2102723/
i don't plan on seeing this because see the point . after moore's performance at last years oscars lost all respect for idiot country is probably facing one of its toughest battles , am talking about war against terrorisim does every remember 9/11 or was that some kind republician stunt think not moron using to forward his agenda
what a joke!! ! you guys should really get your facts straight and don't trust puppet that's funded by hollywood . his documentary is riddled with more holes than slab of swiss cheese first all he used an excerpt from bush speech claimed it was regarding the iraq war in reality talking about israelis palistinians claims that invited taliban to texas for visit wrong , oil company had nothing do him failed mention fact mr bill clinton actually did invite this country nice try michael moron.. please yourself favor check out before believing any propaganda
what a waste of movie.. . if americans want to eat fast food , let them it this was just stupid movie about man who wanted prove how bad for us anything you 3 times day 30 days isn't going turn out pretty an imbecile
gross . imo
well if you overlook the fact that his assertions about mcdonald's are complete supposition based on scientifically inadmissible evidence then film is only , a piece of crap . mr spurlock makes no compelling case against or fast food in general he accuses being interested bottom line yet when doctor's advise him to discontinue experiment bravely forges so can finish and sell it masses who's now ?
just as michael moore spread lies about america in farenheight 9/11 because he actually hates , i have no doubt spurlock used this anti-fast food propaganda . putting aside the fact that a reality movie should never be made is biased mcdonald's all eats mean doesn't even take any nutritional supplements for goodness sakes fast fan know you can't eat every meal and vitamins are necessary optimal operation more so to make me sick believe someone said give chick-fil-a or death !
beautiful film , if you are willing to ignore 6 million dead jews that came afterwards off screen
this movie is a complete sham ! i love walmart . their success in very competitive market proves how great of company they are , with excellent upper management keep on bringin me those low prices
this sucks . didn't the same guy that made first biggie and tupac movie make ? i thought it was amateur filmmaking investigating director should be working for 'celebrity justice' or some sh*t
tupac : let it rest
no!...no!..a thousand times no ! tupac is the busiest dead m*****f***** that i know . what ever happened to taking a 'final' rest ?
i prefer tupac dead .
can this be categorized as a documentary ? what the hell . i'm ashamed that i've even seen it if i recall , had far less t*tties than expected going into my ass
dumb .
would someone tell me why a reality movie was made ? for , i have no clue .
garbage .
most people would rather spend their money on the latest volume of girl's gone wild  .
is this a joke ? why would i watch crap for $10 when can stay at home and see it free on mtv or fox . whoever came up with idea an idiot
what happens when you send 16 beer-drinking teens to mexico ? have the real cancun , possibly worst film in years . i was hoping for something along lines of world  which we interesting characters but just an extended storyline with some nudity and sex instead get a bunch drunk tiny bit this makes jackass look like masterpiece
just when things were looking up in the movies they made this...awful... .
this movie is a travesty . it not only explicitly contains acts of sodomy , murder and violence also sends out bad message to younger viewers as well
suck
that movie was an asault on my ears !
can't stand gangster-type films
you have got to be kidding me . this movie is so boring , violent nihilistic and acted terribly that it seems like no one would but everyone does glorifies criminals who kill not just hundreds also has protagonists beat their wives cuss up a storm are apathetic towards moral good people the length of insanely long re-aired much on television gets annoying even hear coming tele lacks energy creativity optimism masterpieces star trek wars pokemon toy story many more great underrated franchises get out here bad it's deal can't refuse
to much drama
i never got into the whole pulp fiction thing like everyone else did . personally thought movie sucked
the most boring movie i have ever watched . normally don't sleep while watching middle of a or in this case first 40 minutes
what an overrated film !
schindler's list is a fairytale about an event that never happened !
black & white
the only unedited r-rated movie to have nonhonor of airing in broadcast primetime , this movie's nihilism and headache syndrome is out control . stupid way too dark !
i see piano gets several oscars . guess if you make a film about the holocaust are guaranteed an oscar gee , what surprise
where should i begin ? this was a terrible movie , everything about it just plain . the only reason as well known is because holocaust cheesy and phony didnt enjoy beleive that shouldnt be considered great take from me dont waste your time with trash
i thought this movie sucked majorly !
man oh friends tell me that this movie really suck and im glad i havent seen yet not wastin on my money wasted movies
not up to the level of hong kong martial arts movies
i didn't really think it could be any worse than the first one , but was . a horrible movie with no entertainment value whatsoever what do you expect from degenerate like quentin tarantino ?
the godfather movies deserve nothing except to be destroyed and put out of their forsaken misery .
saving private ryan - fubar !
this movie is so graphic that it brings a whole new meaning to the word . sure , i can here sillies in hollywood now that's how was ! of course lame excuse do whatever they want including copious violence profanity and sexuality here's another avoid
the movie was good.. . but speilberg's politics suck
mr . spealberg , please stop doing that films i only liked the first 20 minutes
an unpleasant little film made by ubergeek who's clearly trying hard to compensate for his planet sized nerdiness . what was the point of it exactly ?
as a violence director,this is even more insipid than pulp fiction .
everyone is going to hate me for saying this , but : i speilberg's movies . he's cheap and he sold out the hollywood hype formula only good movie ever filmed was jaws
simple , simplistic utterly contrived and frequently just plain dull . there is absolutely nothing to this movie about as profound a bad comic book
forrest gump is , without a shadow of doubt the worst film i have ever had sad misfortune viewing . this celebration gross stupidity crass completely lacking in any genuine wit and moves at sloth-like pace from ridiculously contrived plotline to another tom hanks leviathan modern film-making as sickly charisma would sooner watch my grandmother being savaged by rabid tigers than view piece rubbish again
what's the point of this moronic movie ? acting is stilted , jokes fall flat and tone typically dark . can't compare to dramatic masterpieces such as star trek : nemesis pokemon 4ever or superman iv quest for peace
i've seen this ridiculous movie and it doesn't move me.it's boring.what does mean ?
the most overrated movie of all time !
overrated . terribley i demand they give back the oscar for best picture
overdramatic , dark boring and laced with useless profanities this r-rated terror of the night needs to learn some lessons from other dramatic franchises such as star trek .
a movie that has no respect for the middle class . scene in which mena suvari could have been shot from side and suggested nudity , but director mendes exposes her you can see discomfort truly ugly hateful film
the movie to see of year , at least according critics who didn't pan this . follows around a pervert man his premiscious daughter and her friend that is same way wife in an affair racist neighbor ditsy one has no with any sense morals anywhere it ! film laced graphic descriptions sexual activity profanity nudity drug use amoral attitdues tons other stuff shouldn't be don't even accept for cash--unless you tape something over like i love lucy andy griffith show or gus emperor's new groove
most overrated , overhyped piece of boring crap i have ever had the misfortune to try and watch . worst
i hated it . all american white trash moive !
american beauty is an absolutely terrible movie . anybody who has any morals should not like this film it a laboriously long that exlploits teenagers and very vulgar lame degrading piece of garbage never have been made why won so many oscars amazing ! maybe the academy taking more to trash these days though
i can not believe that this picture got best ! hadn't seen it before then so had to go rent . was enormously disappointed movie is about as highly rated magnolia both movies suck'
early on , i realized that the title among so many other things about this movie was meant to be sarcastic . it's obvious from opening scene there is not going anything even remotely related word beauty involved in fact had its creators been looking for a more descriptive straightforward they could easily have come up with ugly american  after initial shot of my brain conditioned such occasions long ago 60's and 70's starts telling me will now switch into late 90's hip nihilistic black comedy mode then remember whoops ! think warranty ran out sometime during 80's result when i'm faced brand tripe find it harder forgive makers several number one can't them insulting intelligence crud wins three or oscars two ; taking money exchange if did wait see at cheap seats theater - big cannot their basic statement because found yet another artistic witty original way present process also managed convince panel lost souls deserved national recognition we should all grow thank our lucky stars these forward thinking artists given us something which entertained educated dog-gone-it perhaps shed layer pesky morality thing seems keep popping as continues die words you're really times you genuflect golden statue swallow regardless stinks ice pardon while get gag reflexes under control unable ever proper easy direction ultimate destination moves quickly uglier ends violent crashing grand finale makes war roses (michael douglas kathleen turner) seem like little domestic squabble since viewers are treated generous portions perversion violence psychotic behavior irritating teenage angst pathetic mid-life crises three-layer selection dysfunctional families ugliness every age group personal taste (or distaste) add character entire film has redeeming characteristic ability elicit slightest bit sympathy great reason go
what in the heck is so great about this movie ! i thought plot was lame and acting it jus sucked oevrall
i can't believe this ordinary piece of crap got critical acclaim and that it received accolades for the writting . don't tell me was so clever characters were thinly drawn - just results in a whole film where every scene is unbelievably dumb we're supposed to be seeing humanity no idea
although there were some very poignant moments in this film , it completely glorified a sick obsession that is not only illegal all states (except maybe arkansas) but morally depraved - i'm talking about pedophyllic behavior . the language of 16 year old girl right out white trash trailer park totally disgusted me
this was a movie that tried too hard at depth . it about some guy going through mid-life crisis , and it's effects on others whooptie do
if only there were a lower rating than 1 on rateitall . this movie may have held your attention -- but more out of curiosity for how much worse it would get i'm certain loving must be reflection something very dark within you
i haven't detested a movie so much in long time ; while its good at holding your attention , it fails horribly being the important sets out to be . winds up confused muddle : lives are tedious until you delve into perverse ? there is appreciated our everyday which one guys by trying straddle both with characters that absolute cartoons comes across as dishonest and shallow
this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen . it tries too hard to be deep and artsy
i never thought that a movie version of this wretched book could actually be worse . in major cinematic achievement , its not only it is spectacularly unbelievably
and the indoctrination of america continues.. .
the director of this movie is a total jerk .
this movie was quite disturbing . it just too much and a little one sided racism lies in every race , not
i fell asleep !
i'm going through all the movies currently in top 20 , and this is only one i really did not care for . was so bored could wait it to be over
predictable , sentimental garbage .
it was a riveting movie , but like so many others ruined by giving us anti-southern stereotypes . those clowns in hollywood don't have clue what it's to live here the south tom hanks is fine actor and worthy of much better than this
another boring , sleepy profanity-laced headache drama with no light moments and happy ending .
suck
mawkish , overbearing and at least an hour longer than it deserves to be the green mile makes syrup of ipecac look like aperitif . hanks as straightlaced prison-guard-with-a-heart was so earnest about lending this film some gravity he apparently forgot how absurd story is now matter you cut giant blubbering black men who regurgitate flies are just damn funny -- even if they do have power cure urinary tract infections with one well placed grip worse studio treacle actually got nominated for best picture over boys don't cry rushmore explain that
can you say sucked!!!! !
saw it once ; never want to see again .
i gotta agree with dark . not a very good movie at all it promotes the idea that is okay to abandon your buddies and friends during time of war was long boring scenary beautiful , but just can't get over fact invested three hours my life $7 (us!) watch this worthless flick what can you expect from kevin costner one most untalented over-rated hacks he has made little actually watchable
over-rated garbage . guilty white liberal idea of how the noble savage was destoyed by man see black robe for a more realistic view indian/white interaction
so...long...and...boring.. .
a truly unremarkably film,,,,but remarkable in its ability to trick people . brimming with unrealistic sentimental nonsense designed tug on your little heart strings which disguise the long boring plot and horrible acting of kevin costner second water world as worst kc movie only titanic academy award history
maybe my copy is diffrent . me and a friend watched it we bored stiff last 25 minutes of are pretty good the rest will put you to sleep im big de niro fan thats why i got but even he could not save this film
my all-time least favorite movie . took me 4 times to get the end wish i would have never started watching this piece of trash...
filled with so many profanities , it has no use at all .
i really hated this movie . thought it was boring , and wasn't original or unusual there is a scene where matt damon minnie driver are eating big cheeseburgers kssing at the same time saw that in theatre on screen all have to say eeeewwwww !
just another psiquiatrist movie . predictable the characters didn't really say anything , to me
it's good for insomniacs . it put me right to sleep and the plot is a wee too cliche acting though who said these guys came out of nowhere ? ben affleck did other really films long before this one
just shoot this horse already . i laughed cried almost lost control of my faculties film is the height , epitome chick-flickism trials tribulations : whoa me if you're forced to watch it bring some arsnic
the fact that ron howard directed this may attract viewers , but it will only leave them cuonfused and bored out of their minds . apollo 13 is story 3 astronauts whpo go into outer space spaceship breaks down leaves there stranded without families i was extremly disappointed you be too
i just got so pissed while watching it that couldn't stand to see the screen anymore . wanted leave theatre
more action in a tom & jerry cartoon....slow , slow to boring. .
can a movie get any worse than this boring drama ? i am sure , but not much  !
boring , uninspired totally uncreative headache drama filled with bad acting and writing .
the only reason real life guy was awarded nobel prize out of pity . they had to dredge up some obscure theory from his graduate days that wasnt nonsense and pretend it something relevant today
terrible movie ! deserves the bottom
booooo !
this movie is very bad . it shouldn't have won best picture
lord of the rings deserved that oscar.....not this pile crap .
josh nash was a nazi and an anti-semite . you people suck
i thought this film was absolutely rubbish and had no reason tyo be enjoyed by the viewer . have my opinion so dont care if u others it becaus ei didnt
good acting but a terrible over politically correct plot .
what a pile of dog crap this was and over rated . it is supposed to have some deep meaning about internal struggles , me the story mad man told from slightly saner personality
pathetic.what is so great about this movie ?
one of the most violent , useless movies ever made . not as bad a clockwork orange however
a movie that contains no optimism and has protagonists spreading evil , this one should certainly be avoided at all costs by everyone . the hero of containmates restaurant food makes illegal soap these insane people then want to fight able feel sense course leads alot gore blood with senseless violence around terror got critically acclaimed but we know adult means sexual gritty filled brim whatever happened g-rated live-action genre ?
this made no sense whatsoever . at least the book it's based on is worse
this movie is so unrealistic it isn't even funny . and the acting by cast was awful , considering their talent i think would much rather watch adult porn version of called driving miss daisy crazy  ! lmao ha
unpleasant , pointless trash from the most overrated film maker of our time . tarantino is an uber-geek desperately trying to over-compensate for his extreme nerdiness i suspect comic book guy simpsons would be a big fan

i fell asleep .
this movie was as about much fun having detention on a weekend . it just goes and really who cares they are bunch of brats that deserved to be locked up lot people go how great is i don't understand one the most over rated movies all time
i really don't get it? ? is it because the chick hot !
very disappointing - and what happened to the ending did they run out of money?? ?
needs more asian male actors
stupid picture . actrees
bad movie . honestly the only person in this film,no,movie who was believable or likable for that matter francis mcdormand.what do you expect?she steals every shes not one second did i believethese guys were rock stars.this is an extrememly watered down pasturized version of and roll so it can reach a broader audience offend anyone there nothing about film hear elton john,but we all know doesnt count.i changed my rating from two to because hype terrible makes me ill
i'm in the minority i know , but this movie was not what expected . it pure cheese
i respect tom hanks as an actor . like many of his movies but , c'mon.. what were you thinking ? the movie was 2 1/2 hours long and it just on island could have been a better flick should've cut out most volleyball wilson crap horrible!! !
boring , heartless mean-sprited and too dark headachey to be of any entertainment value one . maybe tom hanks should consider doing a bosom buddies movie or toy story 3!!! !
stupid movie tom hanks should be sorry he made this good thing is such a big star or it could of hurt his career
suck
i hated this movie . it's incredibly unrealistic and very cheesy personally find its ridiculous fight sequences to be a disgrace all martial artists especially the legacy of samurai (whose sword art was poorly portrayed throughout film)
what the hell were they thinking when came up with this movie idea , its sucks ,one of most boring i have seen
really , reallly boring movie!! ! don't go see it!!
this movie was horrible . what the hell up witht whole whale scene please dont see unless you bring a bag to vomit in trust me i wanted projectile all over place needed some zombies am out peace
how did this movie garner so much critical acclaim ? furthermore , could be bad when it had many fine actors the plot moved way too slowly for my taste . i found myself not caring about any of characters (they weren't very likable) which caused me to care what happened in one worst films i've ever seen
what an awful film!!! ! clint eastwood tried hard to steer this movie into something that is intriguing and interesting it was for a while but then the film fell apart storyline became really stupid .
this movie just about has everything i do not like in a . the characters are anything but upbeat and optimistic world that set no creative flair--not even stylized chair can be seen dramatic movies should good vs evil , with lines clearly drawn one certaintly isn't there's gory violence gobs of coarse language sexual material as well topic is also highly disturbing friendly finally ending happy blissful ignorance justice or law
a overrated pile of rubbish . unbelievable story manipulative bad boston accents as for sean penn , see 21 grams better richer performance tim robbins his in jacob's ladder runs circles around this kevin bacon....(don't ask)
so much violence and gore that the movie has no redeeming value .
i can't believe people actually liked this god awful movie . a real lawyer wouldn't let some piece of trailer trash that dresses like she's friggin' prostitute yell profanity in their face but guess if you flash cleavage can get whatever your tiny heart desires
i couldn't agree more with the comment of eb.b5644om  . this is a very manupulative film laughable scripts and false emotions , worst all julie robert most annoying ever ! obviously usual robert's ugling duckling comedy sugar coated in dramatic form since it claimed itself adapted from true story many people thus thought they have seen great cannot believe its popularity critical acclaims except roger ebert (check out his comment) bad langauge unbelievable doubt real erin could get job law firm degree foul mouth rude attitude prostitute-worn wardrobes let alone insult lawyers made completely idiots remember films based on do not always right details or even lines
congrats to quentin tarantino for once again proving that he cannot make a movie without pointless violence.....the man is seriously sick and has no talent whatsoever.....why anyone would show him any respect after the horrid pulp fiction beyond me... .
when are people going to realize that julia roberts is one of the least talented actresses ever (dis)grace screen ? this movie an insult anyone with even a modicum intelligence . chauvinism aside , theres not company in existence would put up bitch like past her first coffee break grotesquely implausible forced acting performances (especially from roberts) and vapid dialogue makes rates must avoid 
suck

i hated this british drama . it only glorified drug use and stupidity the movie is highly overrated a waste of time to watch
seen it . heard been there , done that only i remember was better last time
a phony movie from top to bottom ! true story of racism disneyfied . (i have yet see group people break out in song) waste time
if you liked the other 2 indiana jones movies than probably won't like this one . filled with cheep laughs and dumb one-liners it tries to be more of a comedy an action movie harrison ford is still good , but supporting cast could have come off street somewhere in any city america few parts though admittedly their are major dissapointment
another angst-ridden drama with no bright spots and smile-worthy moments . stay out of this bedroom
i mean come on .
is mel gibson acting out some long suppressed hatred for an old history teacher ? that seems like the only explanation all these unhistorical pieces of crap he does
aside from one humorous scene involving a rocking chair and the occasional cute moment , this movie is not enjoyable in slightest . acting too low-key very angst-ridden plot wholly uncreative cynical borders on nihilistic battle scenes are terribly done gore factor kills them completely drags for way long even historical aspects of film cant redeem it rene auberjonios (star trek deep space nines odo) plays an interesting characterwho killed that also good thing
a fraud and sham
i thought that this movie was pathetic pro-american propaganda . it historically inaccurate and made the british look like baby killing tyrants some people would pretend is historcally accurate scary pure entertainment nothing more similar to braveheart , which twisted history try make seem worse than nazis
scandalous treatment of history . this movie is a fraud
ill smack you and trust me i can
this is one of the most annoying movies i've ever seen . i was hoping winona's character would get brutalised by guards she thoroughly deserved it - whinging on in that horrid nasal voice hers watched movie with a doctor friend mine who working psychiatric hospital at time he said basic plot (they wouldn't let her out , even though voluntary patient) completely lacked credence as for angela jolie's there didn't apopear to be anything wrong what doing nut house ? having undergo est if any do sane person against their will 60s ! load rubbish
ha ! this movie blew it was some pathetic goth kid's wet dream
what a very bad joke of movie....pathetic .
talk about a boring , pointless disappointing movie ! i mistakenly thought that girl interrupted was going to be moving inspirational story woman confronting serious mental illness . instead the main character (played by winona ryder) has no legitimate reason for committing herself institution and viewers are subjected watching her pathetic self-indulgent behavior as she finds among crazies even worse- drags on feared it would never end started feeling suicidal myself during last third of only watched rest because my husband wanted see ending you have been warned
oliver stone needs to read gerald posner's book , case closed - that is if mr . can stand the truth (he also learn as all film makers need actors who aren't from texas can't hope imitate accent or any other for matter)
any one who believes there was a conspiracy should read posner's cose closed . anyone with modicum of critical thinking and common sense looks at the raw data assassination would come to logical conclusion that oswald line gunman anti-castro cubans , pro-castro military cia fbi dallas police mob lbj secret service .... yeh they were all involved oh what about aliens i guess oliver stone did not have enough time include them remember occumm's razor - things considered equal simplist explanation is usually correct it get over it! !
suck
he sucked as president , so the movie would also naturally suck .
walt disney pictures should of produced this movie since it dealt with fantasyland from beginning to end.. .
dumbest movie i have ever seen !
this movie however true it might be was way to depressing for me .
absolute worst 2bux i wasted in a looong looooong time.....this is one god awful movie with nothing redeeming it whatsoever..michael d talent here this poorly written downer of film . wonder if there was actually director on the set turkey , simply no emotion captured whatsover chemistry between any cast/characters....very boring to lame space music score which only amplifies lack original story...not single credible character care about...ridiculous scene where michael (the dad) meets up his daughters negro junkie dealer and does about ! pretty dumb when he's head top federal dea type agency dozens agents at disposal entire plot borders improbable....9 count em seconds screen time for salma hayak? ? wished they would have given her couple actual lines say...the teenage daugher miscast she isn't very or believable....whoever wrote terrible screenplay needs their wga membership taken away again most can remember (but love forget) past 5 years easily -----todd wiseman -----ohio univ college cinematography
sucked
walked out on it .
junk . it is a tour of what goes on around brilliance , but never actually portrays any this leads me to believe that it's writers are also not brilliant smoke screen you hear about how great the kid's book or see writing marilyn monroe's old jacket so ? at end michael douglas says oh and crabtree he's still busy being huh (downey) got virtually no exposition statement exactly supposed mean us beats there's dead dog in car trunk one point now that's wacky i hate give such low rating movie pushing for all can be some kind poets society simply has none substance which movies essential can't people get suckered by obvious hype waste time
i rented it and fell asleep.boring silly . one of the worst movies have ever seen
i gave this movie a rating of 1 because it was not interesting or appealing to my best interest . throughout the constantly falling asleep
whatever ! this movie sucked .
show me the value! ! this catchprase-originating movie isn't worthy of doing so . bad all around
suck
i just don't understand why this movie got so high ratings and is still talked about today . when watched it , seemed like a plain to me has such common uninteresting plot maybe didn't get the meaning behind i'd be more than happy learn though if anyone's willing discuss it..
tom cruise should retire from acting , because mainly he act for beans and that makes a total fool of himself in them . also fools the other actors actresses with him jerry maguire is perfect example how bad really
gay ! no other word for this tobey macguire crapfest . man what a chick flick
stupid !
terribly dark , violent and nihilistic film about the second world war . bad acting combined with no creativity make this a failure through
this movie was stupid in that it wasn't filmed very well . you fall asleep the first half hour because there is more talking than action film often changes to black and white which makes whole picture suck
not exactly a true story . this is someone's version of using elements they want and disregarding other
i must have watched a different movie or something because all saw was an annoying woman , that looked like guy shoot and rob couple of men . can't help but wonder if charlize got the oscar for lesbian love scene
julia stiles sucks . so does sean patrick thomas
insanity! ! how does this movie even compare to a real film ? any positive feeling could have left me with was sucked away by julia stiles's nonexistant acting talent blech . give break mtv , i can't believe payed see someone out there somewhere owes 8 bucks
i have to agree with an above post when he said...poo .
poo
i had absolutely no trouble falling asleep on the airplane when they aired this extremely bland movie...it was a nice sleeping aid...boring , boring  !
she had me feeling bad for her right up to the point when cheated on husband . wtf was that ? loved so much and cared , is thanks -- cheats him with freak sorry ruined movie it would have been great a real tearjerker even guys like until sh#t before all you over-analyzers get my case about fact wanted experience life only made love shut ! just because dying does not make
incest and abortion . need i say more ? this movie left me with a sick feeling in my gut not at all how the previews portrayed it should have read some reviews before went saw
dull director working .
of course , there would not have been a missile crisis (and the movie) if jfk had left cubans to die on beach in '61.. .
dumb , and dummer . don't seem to see the director making anything these days so maybe there is some justice in world a rip-off super 35mm just another version of cheap superscope that came out 1950's only good fim shoot process was vera cruz
this movie was about 2 1/2 hours to long . i cared more the ship then useless made up characters that brought very little plot most over rated picture of alllll timmmmeee
god-awful maudlin junk . the ship should have sunk an hour earlier and saved us all angst
by the middle of movie , i was ready to root for iceberg . long on dialouge and short plot passes like molasses in antartica acting is atrocious predictable (even without sinking!) it just goes prove that popularity does not always mean quality
why is it that you could eat in the finest of restaurants and still have bad food ? money spend for this movie revigorated economy a small 3-rd world country.and what result?love story between social classes?yeah , very entertaining.a young picasso on his way to america?yeah realistic.a upper class vilain spiting heads poor?pleaaassseee.....ok sinking ship was excellent,but who cares?like i said can crapy meals .
a terrible film that deserves to be sunk (cool pun fully intended!) entirely predictable , the instead of focusing on plot ship or fascinating technical blunders occured focus yawn-inducing romance . course ending is obvious anyone who knows history...but...i wrote short story (used as prologue in my own) where crew enterprise (along with such allies mario sonic some power rangers etc.) save titanic and introduce lead male character video games fast food therby preventing nude paintings from occuring :) i also snuck cameo mr limpet reference ariel starfleet's first mermaid
i tried to watch this , really did . but right from the start film was not compelling me bill paxton is one of first faces you see and although he seems have some gifts late in directing his own films a terrible actor could no reason at all why an ancient old lady would take helicopter ride out site wreck order tell her story what don't telephone ? takes place 1996 after leo dicaprio bad love usual claptrap hollywood script bin completely unrealistic how hell won best picture beyond my comprehension james cameron's abyss original terminator had more characters better presented stories frankly dances with wolves (another overrated picture) than titanic honestly think they both pic only bacause audiences were surprised themselves for being able sit thru 3+ hours
what a sad , useless thing was created here . the acting sucked it porrly directed woman had barely any boobs this movie totally mocked whole concept of boat sinking i saw once and to go home watch forty-eight hours back future indiana jones rocky clear my mind crap
this is the one of only movie i will ever give a 1 star rating and gave it because couldn't 0 ! hated dicaprio worst actors i've seen . as you can see don't like romantic crap , it's ok once in wile but base off doesn't work that first time made me have to pee so bad wouldn't recomend
after the first hour and 1/2 , i was rooting for iceberg .
this movie was horrible . it set a new low in filmic history for academy award winners , and possibly marked the point at which film reached maximum sentimental hogwash right down there with dancing wolves (fools) cameron has developed into total fool having created rather remarkable terminator then divorced his talented wife
this was definatly one of the worst movies i ever saw .
one star because of the music . i hated this movie ! what was academy high on when they made win best picture ? leonardo dicaprio can't even play dead , he's such a horrible actor and no else did much better plus it about three hours fourteen minutes too long if you don't get i'm implying please see me pointless have plans to ever again
most over-rated movie of all time .
really bad movie only good part was when jack died , it so funny i could'nt stop laughing . rose deserved to get smacked in the face
has to be the biggest disappointment this decade
i did not like this movie simply because there was too much hype involved . it four hours long and the graphics were that good soundtrack could have been better
this movie had only one positive.. . the real picture shots of original titanic under water other than , love story thing was a huge joke i absolutely hated it
what a horrible movie ! leo can't act . there are many holes in the plot too big of an age difference between winslet and dicapprio modern cliches this early 1900's film why didn't have accent like others on boat ? i liked detail props , plates clothing etc it was so long
this movie was too long and predictable . it relied much upon the star quality of its male lead to sell tickets it's hard make a about historical event not predicable , but we all know that in end ship sinks also if you watched previews already knew everything happens very disappointing boring i fell asleep during
biggest all time flop of 'titanic' proportions . don't even bother considering it because the acting stinks , theme song will never get out your head and you'll spend better sleeping
this move stunk ! rose was nothing but a slut . the acting over done it not historicaly accurate to bad people dont really know there history they would see how lame movie however americans are for most part well educated on anything directly involving them so fooled masses
you aint neva guna get cold mountain
this movie was absolute tripe , awful! ! you can tell the story taken from a well written book and instead of being true to it completely hollywood-ised where half-way through we were seeing whose who hollywood which detracted . nicole kidman is good actress but failed stretch her ability or show any growing potential like hours others accents awful if your getting paid $15 million for least could do some respect audiences intelligence convincing southern accent
this is pro notre dame propaganda and that's it .
one of the worst movies all time . it was not powerful , and certainly didn't move me sean astin so unbelievable as rudy....
this piece of crap winning best picture over saving private ryan has to go down as one the biggest travesties in academy award history .
most over-rated boring movie i've ever seen .
shakespeare in love is the most overrated film . it had a stale plot and bad acting i don't think gwyneth paltrow deserved an oscar for this movie
capricious use of shakespeare .
this movie is terrible in my opinion . what a waste of good actors i tried to sit through it twice unfortunately , the first time was on an airplane and there no escape! ! (shades clockwork orange ? ha ha)
oh my god ! this movie sucked so bad
suck
this movie is simply awful . from the start , you are assualted with coarse language and goriest violence that i've ever seen highly pessimistic death angst around every corner creativity nowhere to be found nary an imaginative spark
not worth my time or money .
this movie sucked . i mean it had pee-wee herman come on people
it sucked a fat one
this movie was just creepy.....i can't believe i sat through the whole thing .
very disappointing !
just read the guidelines for writing comments and you stated love to laugh . i'm sure were amused at one of your rate-its who believes that sexuality is only thing binds us humans together statement makes me want cry poor unfortunate soul lives a life believing same writer also states human race nothing more than cattle thank god.. said can do moo...he did give quills 5 stars , which about what cow would it another comment from was writter marque wrote his passions sexual urges in time considered wrong have i missed something or not still capture under age girls exploitation guess masturbating into chalice be termed but there anyone out cyber space thinks some things are morally ? film represents freedom......and ask freedom what?? does rate-it believe any carries profound weight responsibility this pornographic its scary our society today gives pornography all while worshiping golden calf they call
while reading your opinions on this movie i was astonished . in all sincerity can't image how you guys could have possibly seen for more than a vulgar pornographic flick believe that seventeen year old children can walk off the street and see film , our society's moral standards should be reviewed one would to agree played their roles well..they were full of emotion very dramatic still just anyone find makes sex look so dirty amazingly good most at show left appauled who enjoys slightly twisted lacking something own sexual relations really feel been rated nc-17
i thought this movie was a waste of time . the acting ok , but story line ridiculous what w/ singing ? don't think could have stood another minute tom cruise his caracter incredibly annoying can't picture as womanizer
simply the worst movie i've seen this year . they should use to torture prisoners
a 3.5 hour waste of time.. . very disappointing ! though the cast is wonderful and acting awesome storyline rotted i watched waiting for lives to entwine or coincidence (as portrayed in beginning) occur was left empty with too distant connections alot off wall incidences that spoiled what you would view as serious movie - each character singing same song frog shower.. pooh good music throughout but could buy soundtrack without wasting so much time
i don't think that they should of re-made this movie . it's a classic and have stayed way hate when movies are it shows total lack creativity plus , changed the ending so now not as good recomend film see first one instead
i hated this movie , it was so boring . way overrated
i couldn't stand watching this one , my girlfriend and turned it off after a half hour . didn't find clever at all if want to watch film about crooks i'll goodfellas casino usual suspects reservior dogs etc falls flat on it's face
having read the objectionable content described on screenit! , i can certaintly tell you that would never watch this movie .
pure crap .
one of the few films i've walked out on early in film . opening scenes it shows effects a would-be plane crash...i turned to my friend and stated "it looks like movie set," which he laughed agreement then we see victim from crash laying there supposedly dead , but who doesn't even look real...so at that point decided was either leaving theatre or falling asleep - left
i'd rather see "sack lunch" 20 times consecutive before watching 10 minutes of this borefest . if you think i'm an idiot , just remember elaine benes claimed to have iq 180
i actually am a man who likes well-done dramatic love stories , really lol . but just like elaine on seinfeld twisting in agony my chair waiting for this yawner to end
a great movie if you run out of tylenol pm .
this movie was incredibly boring . it took too long to figure out what going on and by the time you did , didn't even care anymore
i only hate this movie because elaine hated it on seinfeld .
this movie was so stupid and boring .
the movie just seems old way overdone
the actors couldn't save this movie from what it is . whole premise of and its screenplay completely off biggest problem that written for you to feel sorry sam (the retarded father) him regain custody his 7 year old daughter but every ounce common sense sides with bad guys believe should not have sole aimed at making a father an iq be able take care himself just doesn't work
pathetically stupid and completely unrealistic .
[update : i did finally see the whole movie . to prevent people from buying or renting it...the goes like this...all dogvillians treat outsider nicole kidman crap and eventually get point where all men-folk chain her bed rape her...except for dude who truly loves (even though he is an absolutely pathetic idiot) stupid end up calling gangsta daughter , knowing that they will probably kill well turns out of she hates running away but even more gangstas everyone in dogville burn town down personally kills idiot so-called boyfriend nothing help [original post] went blockbuster last night van helsing's were checked so it was either envy picked poorly if just one humanoid reads my review avoids viewing feel rateitall serves some purpose mankind horrid ; dog pile i'll a second pretentious rich brie chianti latte liberals drive huge hummers sundance festival (yet object common families driving suvs) praise this anti-american dreck no why every airs at sucks am much touch with pseudo-intelligentsia our country turn yet invest heavily defense stocks also cannes considering seditious fahrenheit 911 won palm d'or doesn't say something except i'm sure poseurs artsy-fartsy phonies marvel naturalistic setting instead mean barking word written on floor supposed represent purportedly canine story deals miserable little village called (symbolic america) are talk real slow stupid-like americans) drops into as bimbo gangsters (i think symbol enlightened foreigner cares) cast pretty good lauren bacall paul bettany others should have known better despite big-buck has high school thespians reading off cue cards boredom tedium bludgeons you opening credits wife kidding ko'd sleep by first 5 minutes took me three days suffer through would fall repose only be bored back somnelescence again dreadfully stultifying sonorous dialogue does anything interesting exciting after about 45 pulled plug watch auburn-mississippi game (far intellectually stimulating) then boring disturbing depressing supposedly danish made flick making allegory how awful rotten we americans particularly treatment outsiders guess thinks ugly cordial arab terorrists butcher 3,000 us god really stinks anybody says friends funny can't too gay transpired because had coming hopefully helsing available next week
i read all the books from this extremely talented woman . unfortunately can't ever get into a movie once i've book visual is too distracting imagination not to mention , it easier mind of people in than probably why prefer over any day
i hated the book and movie . kids going around brandishing knives families falling apart ? where's fun in that my vision of 50s goes more along leave it to beaver or happy days lines than this uninspired , headache-inducing dreck no at all
the book was alright , but motion picture extraordinarily corny and only somewhat reminiscent of novel . once again i have to agree with lord waves this an embarrassment
i would rather slit my wrists while crawling over broken glass than ever have to sit through this negative experience again .
hated this film as it was very dark and created a macabre feeling in the senses . of course , that its intention but disconcerting one nevertheless
awful direction with non-sense camera movements and continuos wrong use of the time in scenes . i save music but not inclusion all musical parts everybody may think it is great terrible
maybe i was watching a different garden state from these other posters . did they make 2 of them ? because the one saw dull stinkorama that put my wife to sleep in 15 minutes and intermittently me out reposo all menadering mess gen-x gen-y slackers , losers dudes dudettes wasting their north jersey lives doing nothing interspersed with drugs unlike seinfeld neither funny nor interesting it had look feel kevin smith movie without humor just don't have interest or patience film about going nowhere like zack braff hate him scrubs his attempt be next david schwimmer even vaunted soundtrack sucked humble opinion
this is probably the only movie with jodie foster in it that i hate . whole thing was just boring ,  ! don't even think a child would care for
amovie that makes you feel like jumping off a bridge . depressing as hell
i agree with irishgit : junk !
this movies gives chick flicks a bad reputation .
after reading the book (which was ok) , and seeing a list of cast members (natalie portman stockard channing ashley judd sally field) i thought that this movie had some potential . boy wrong ! it awful from start in fact so bad many ways started fast-forwarding hope i'd get to something at least watchable never did acting crummy story didn't translate very well noticed got one-star rating my local paper can definitely see why don't rent where heart is under any circumstances
this movie sucks
the usual old jokes and stereotypes about italians : rome in ending looks like a cross between naples venice . oh gee ! i feel sorry for david duchovny , who's good guy...
expected some fun here . found a sh!tload of virtual emotions based on the political and other things brutal pointless see forget this movie can be seen for time wasting but you wouldn't want to it after again shmack !
this is the most disgusting movie i have ever seen ! talk about blood and guts it's only slightly less boring than matrix  . come on , 4 guys go out to get some gold from iraqies...how can you possibly make a story of ? no plot whatsoever
nihilistic , violent and just plain stupid .
jeepers . what nonsense
originally i wasn't even going to rate this stinker . but feel the mass must know what a horrible job littly boy leo did movie  !
the most offensive piece of garbage that i have ever seen and that's saying a lot considering don't get offended easily . all can say about this movie i'm sorry but fail to see what makes brilliant or even interesting felt nothing for characters didn't really care epic battle between irish natives 
'gangs of new york' is probably one the most disappointing films i've seen in my entire life . epic ? lawrence arabia just long , as far i can tell with a few historical sidebars thrown here and there to flesh out an otherwise rambling somewhat pointless story this was fascinating time our history no doubt about it but facts dates all re-arranged main boiled down simple revenge tale.. i'm not sure what scorsese getting at while turf war theme certainly plays into current horrifying political situations that alone doesn't make me feel anything for these characters daniel day lewis does fantastic job question leo isn't half bad either couple terrible musical choices (ending u2 song it's 1800's love pete!) discernable visual style (it seems said he needed say fighting 'raging bull' you'll only get warmed over braveheart here) movie became least favorite scorsese's brilliant career
my god i couldn't wait until this movie was over .
wow ! what a stinko this movie was praised as being entertaining . that tells you where hollyood has gone i guess anything isn't remake of 1950s , or sequel is considered original and therefore good hollywood needs scriptwriters bad the person who wrote sreenplay for lost in translation probably didn't even graduate from high school simply awful
if you ever want to watch a movie that isn't good at all , i recommend lost in translation . heard great things about this so grabbed six-pack and sit on the couch watched was priceless compared crappy (and it cheap beer) have apologized my dvd player every since for making play such garbage p.s.- sorry
to say that i dislike this movie is an understatement , loath it . lost in translation was a painful watch know the point of feel character's alienation but didn't sympathetic towards characters waaaaaa japan such strange country my life so boring overrated piece fluff !
this movie didn't hold my attention at all . as much i had heard about the sweet , simple plot and gentle charachter development was looking forward to it husband watched whole thing but zoned out after 30 mins very slow boring artsy for sake of being so would not recommend
did not care for this movie at all . a total waste of time do recommend it
i fell asleep and never saw the end . asked a customer (i work in video store) about it he told me ending all can say is : 1) boring!!! ! 2) what was about?! ? do they really think people will swallow that
i hated this movie . am so happy that rented it and didn't spend $6.25 to see fell asleep the 1st time tried watch a 2nd could get into 3rd ,
this movie was a waste of $8.25 2 hours .
little boy gets laid story . about as interesting someone popping zits
hated this movie . it was like going to a strangers high school reunion and listening all their old stories you just don't care about the or people it's boring
nothing beats watching 30+-year-old bad actors portraying teenagers in horrible movies .
spike lee , for some reason received a lot of praise this film . i thought it was foul-mouthed bore movie whose message got lost in all the cussing anyway by end characters--black and white--were so annoying didn't care what happened to any them said after oscars that year he robbed but think only people who were ones paid see mess
the passion of myth
one of the most overrated films ever . truth matter is that it's plotless , slow moving pointless and boring with silly unrealistic kung-fu choreographing stick bruce lee jackie chan absolute cr@p
wait , so what is this movie about again ? it had no plot good acting traits for that matter yet.. . still considered a because the us infested with retarded christians who keep babbling jesus was petty excuse mel
terrible movie . focuses on jesus' torture in attempts to guilt people into believing him or going church where was the focus his teachings and beliefs ? a big-budget horror nothing more
i really can't see what all the hype is about -- this movie was no different than any sunday school class or biblical epic from years gone by ; it just had more blood and gore . there violence for violence's sake , gibson did tell us a story we already know yet it's that uncontested subtitles were distracting took lot away performances given actors saddest part gibson's statement (along with his father) holocaust mainly fictionalized event but unlike death of christ actually have documented evidence sickens me making so much fortune off film religious figure kind ironic not ?
this is the worst movie i have ever seen! ! although , never laughed so hard from a almost cramped up man . flying looks silly at last couldn't do anything else than laugh hooh by way if could would give minus 5 stars
what a grossly overrated film ! one of the worst i've seen in last couple years . people flying and floating air hell was it about anyways ?
for the real truth of this disgusting portrayal go to www.letgodbetrue.com and read animated crucifix . total blasphemy word god tells us if any presents another jesus other than bible we are refuse it was not a long haired sissy mommas boy mary had nothing do with his work on earth she be saved just like is dead in her grave now has no power authority but pathetic lie commercial twisted perverted catholic demon doctrine from hell woe those who add or take away pure fiction supstitions fables only totally biblical illiterates could believe garbage
the passion directing was very poor . only good thing about it that language fitted setting besides , editing and angle shots were not original there is a big mistake at end of movie where jesus' hands get nailed to cross discovered few years ago jesus could have been by but rather wrists nails support his weight focused too much on one spectrum life as oppose overall picture mary's portrayal more effective if she would appeared be convulsive see her son die instead had occassional breakdown difficult imagine who seeing child tortured lack expression deeper emotion frankly i dont believe mel gibson did this for money nonetheless should stick what he does best-acting movies
i did not get this on at all you've folks jumping around like they are in the matrix and no one seems to know why . a couple of nice fight scenes but whole way over rated
mel gibson is a pandering opportunist who creates intense images that play on our religious and emotional sensitivities . the bible says jesus died for sins but economics of this movie proves dying wallet if he were anything better , would be showing it in theaters free
a most vulgar and offensive exploitation film . an anti-semitic slasher flick with wes craven overtones like faith professions of contemporary christianity , this nonsense focuses almost exclusively on the cult personality jesus emphasizing his identity as god made flesh while shortchanging more valuable significance agent divine providence redeemer prophet devoting about five minutes 144 minute running time to teachings extreme anthropomorphizing falls just shy blasphemy larger moral message gets lost movie's unrelenting obsession cruelty brutality is cheapshot opportunistic ploy satiate american moviegoing public's worship gore carnage in gibson exploiting what referred synoptic gospels circumspect fashion central issue scripturally speaking not human suffering christ but redemptive process which it part mad mel's telling story freddy krueger vein apparently cynical attempt optimize box office receipts result heavy-handed ill-advised reliance shock effect that actually tends desensitize viewer after fifteen prime focus masochistic flaying/cruxifiction spectacle lack affect by participants characters are insufficiently developed there shortage significant connection become mere cardboard cutouts has cartoonish feel acting isn't even worth talking hence emotionally vacant sensationalist torture crowds out ethos depiction jews especially pharisees seen being evil vicious totally without redeeming qualities justification for their actions position was crucified iconoclasm rabble rousing three crimes very justifiable punishment back those days given cursory reference discounted negative windowdressing perpetuation medieval stereotypes grossly intolerant atavistic irresponsible addition presence craven-like satan figure also troubling : firstly image depicted woman example typical rc misogyny akin anti-semitism ; secondly shown only within manic jewish further underscoring implied thirdly extension imagery demonized children theme (seen berating judas bald midget held during jesus) serving no defensible narrative or scriptural purpose mel tries take romans off hook culpability passion pilate brute who recalled from judea due excessive he inflicted portrayed contemplative conflicted goodguy caught between demands duty conscience at odds historical accounts roman soldiers abused mostly pictured loutish functionaries merely following orders subscribes conservative form catholicism follows he's attempting here sanitize record through revisionist denial movie marked simplistic comparison/contrast all good vs women (the two marys) bad figure) child (jesus christ) (mentioned above) reductive black white manichaean thinking primitive way apprehend existence figures prominently bore notable inaccuracy both versions christ's final words (found matthew john) moment expiration uttered critical contradictory inauthentic unscriptual were several depictions typically hokey catholic magic destruction temple reattachment ear garden gethsemane etc yet perhaps greatest shortcoming turkey opportunity ascendance would have been spread christian love tolerance mercy grace forgiveness redemption seriously lacking these themes if anything few them bum's rush near end repulsive liberties taken earlier extended scourging scenes obviously considered important great tale deicide pervaded sense surgical detachment devoid any palpable uplift
not funny . i didn't laugh once
horrific , disturbing disgusting revolting sickening and spectacularly violent . as a christian i don't need to be tortured love jesus
it is difficult for me to express my suffering in actually having sit through this violent foreign language movie .
the passion of christ is like a religious version texas chain saw massacre . its cute trick by mel gibson to use blood and gore create controversy line his pockets at same time i am sure he grinning ear laughing all way bank
this was a horrible movie . i actually went and saw it at the theater , mainly because of good ratings had received intrigued by storyline did not care about one person in film or bad feelings could tell you any characters name mark wahlberg may be stiffest actor history cinema basically no just little snippets into lives porn actors even interesting pieces that after came out there talk burt reynolds winning best supporting for his part ? lol what he have maybe 20 lines am college educated appreciate well done unique movies but really curious professional reviewers see when they review why rated so high
one of the sleazest movies i have seen . kept waiting for something good to happen found myself being very disappointed this movie about a guy who gets into pornography crummiest
this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen . it seems to try for a tarntino-like quality , but doesn't even come close avoid..
although the film started of hopeful and with a great message , ending completely ruined it for me . acting from helen hunt kevin spacey is good but could have been executed more energy there are few moments depressing kills entirely
lame , too preachy . i love kevin spacey but even with all the good intent (i saw making of stuff on hbo) movie just didn't work subtle is better than in your face preaching also gang stereotype was unrealistic
looking for a boring movie that will put you to sleep , and make have your iq 50 points?? ? pay it forward must me .
an r-rated movie that is shockingly marketed toward teenagers , this one promotes sexuality as freedom like too many trashy teen movies of our time . it includes not just premarital sex but drug use violence and nudity the creators actors in film note they had to find a non-obnoxious way make modern virgin that's right my friends being pure obnoxious unpopular (i've never heard anything more ridcioulous!) thankfully didn't gross much several i know wanted watch at school certainly has cruel intentions corrupt avoid all costs
if you watch cruel intentions and then dangerous liasons , realize the difference that world class actors such as john malkovich glenn close can make on a film . unfortunately makers of selected wb who apparently didn't understand or appreciate importance chemistry / dialogue etc in this movie's plot
this is a terrible , movie . the acting atrocious direction awful and dialogue painful to listen do not waste your time with pathetic rip off - get real thing by renting dangerous liasons
pretentious , pointless and a waste of 2 1/2 hours my life . i dont care how this dross is dressed up as art-house there are dozens plotlines (for want better word) characters (ditto) that go nowhere fr'instance the men in diner talking about nightmare night visit to weird theatre symbolism blue box...i hate film with passion ok naomi watts buff was alright but that's it
i can't say it any better than shroowoman , read the book . and film is totally inaccurate first off not a gun company that was sued in tobacco only one juror kicked three jurors are after being approached about her abortion rikki coleman attempts suicide ; they never even approach rankin fitch meets nicholas easter if wou want to see good movie jury '12 angry men' trust me tons
an excellent example of a perfectly-awful movie . this has all the elements that cause me to dislike it with passion first off , there is no creativity or imagination present--like too much today's entertainment pure reality present day nothing beyond norm are clear heroes villains and everyone many flaws be chosen as character support angst anger omnipresent throughout not single ray optimism can found anywhere in feature ending perfectly dreadful well either dead miserable but one reasons i very rarely watch r-rated movies less enjoy them
if the woman had just said , hey ! i don't own a small business so why do have to pay this tax ? then all of that ugliness could been prevented . but course there'd be no movie after big lose there
i would say it was good.. . but wasn't
this was awful . couldn't get through 30 m's of it !
i didn't like this . it's not exciting at all , and more a b movie
((spoilers in here...not that anyone's going to see this flick again)) movie was pure sap , emotional drivel all its disgusting glory . you could tell when it's time cry because the piano ensemble would thunder background telling it told me patch's [much younger] girlfriend cryptically killed but rather than tear up i do think what hell just happened? ! main message of is : rules are bad authority eeevil and course acting like an idiot will cheer terminally ill people don't i've ever seen a more mindless
flying??? ? what next?
robin williams' dramatic cry alongs get really old in patch adams . the movie starts out okay but soon progresses into an overly that will bore you to tears
one of the worst movies i have ever seen .
truly dramatic and a bit corny . the dialogue did not fit in modern day scene it destroyed my love for shakespearian work leo's just an impressive actor i don't know what is about him could never understand why many women thought he was/is attractive only thing like movie where romeo tybalt battle think leguizamo stunning this his costumes are amazing
this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen in my life . didn't mind idea of making a modern romeo and juliet , but bombed it badily who had stupid using old language with ? nothing from can be saved except to say that was crap
romeo and juilet was a great shakespere story that people read loved , but after seeing the film i have different feeling for . if you try put leonardo dicaprio is kind of role know what movie are going to
i didn't like this movie because it took away from the essence of original . although gave a modern perspective , seemed as if they were trying to mix today's behaviour with ancient language
this movie sucked! ! i watched it because my daughter loves , but just thought was terrible . partly can't follow shakespeare quite that quickly and shakespeare's version a love story- story about gangs
worst movie i have seen in years . a bunch of legendary actors gather together into whqat would be great if it were about something completely different donald sutherland is one the greatest to grace planet but not even he could save this terrible
incredibly insulting movie . yet another film that demonizes businessmen just because they are easy targets the opening scenes in thie wickedly cruel towards for crime of doing their job
i do not know what led me to believe this would be a comedy but was truly disappointed when quickly found that it wasn t . further the entire story depressing , pointless and had an ugly edginess drew barrymore did convince she woman at age of 15 36 or anything in between failed her character deserving my sympathy respect half time wanted slap some sense into other simply lost interest self-involved mindset set herself up fell then proceeded whine blame everyone around kept wanting say if you re as smart think are college career so important get off your butt part-time job student loan go for join rest real world were we really supposed feel sorry self-interested idiot who ignores child proceeds dry pot oven government subsidized shack quick cash ? apparently no more than meant enjoy dreadful tale woe
i hated this movie  . the acting was awful and it boring
i hate it when hollywood gets all preachy and this movie was the ultimate in . liberals are innately good conservatives right-wing psychos is getting old didn't we already see an american president or on west wing ? stop already! ! both sides have flaws so why doesn't make more realistic movies about politics , like primary colors -- how should be bullworth
this film has many conceptual problems as well my own with the politics in movie . first joan allen is portrayed being a centerist democrat who was once republican party however her closing statement interview by judiciary committee filled not only democratic , but extreme leftist views which could never reality come from had at one time been believable member of type positioning serves to make far leftists think they are actually moderates and further divide population secondly based on mouth piece for liberals produced directed starred wrote tripe additionally any candidate vice president under conditions she be appointed would confirmed too radical there no need reporting sex scandal or adulterous acts simply furthermore jeff bridges makes bones about his want have woman (not just that woman) fill position regardless experience qualifications while may agree approach i do must test individual before hiring them concluding scenes requests an immediate roll call vote joint session congress approval followed standing ovation entire applauds though were going war complete utter bs if stated earlier brought up appointment unbelievable entirely unrealistic venue republicans centerists alike stand words finally equates leadership skills some sort political destiny you against true leader might congressmen can see through such propoganda apparently makers american people cannot fear generally rather poorly attended so believe most tell when someone trying veil dialogue guise suspense
this movie states that after a jewish contestant there would be christian who do better 2% of america is , therefore the odds are 50-1 in favor next not being all things equal even non-jewish what goof trying to imply anti-semitism?? ?
this movie was stupid .
the most overrated film i've seen since shrek 2.(and that was just last may!!!)one of worst and boring films ever saw .
i hated this movie . really they don't explain anything until the last lines of figured out what 21 grams was supposed to be about early on and still didn't make any sense it just seemed like a horrible story without meaning behind sean penn does good job , if you're young horny male you'd interested know that you get see naomi watts naked but those are only possible things could ever anyone liking sucked
samuel jackson was awesome , but this the most anti-arab movie(along with delta force) . why pick yemen as bad guys they haven't done anything serious(prior to cole) never said what problem in ; just assumed that there always trouble mid east show arab civilians barbarians love kill people(kids and women) besides ending so predictable verdict could have been guilty or somebody die also us government hypocrites can 80 because of 3 navy men do not rent movie unless you like see racism a good thing
what the hell is adam sandler doing???he had a promising career in comedy,but he decided to move into deep thought pics just win an oscar-what wus . i'm spending my money on rob schnieder
i've always been told by my girlfriends how great this film is . after i watched it decided that the only reason why they had come to conclusion was because brad pitt in a cast , but very slow boring script and plot which lacked any depth of character resulted wooden shallow performances from everyone
it is hard for me to give this film a very high rating.as great cast has and as wonderful the performances may be , lacks any positive or happy moments . there not one redeming quality about feeling you get from picture do like watch family loved ones go through complete anguish misery ? every up turn in movie does horrible down swing towards an unimaginable worse brothers watching their die husbands wives shot without doubt most pointlessly depressing ever made what i walked out of when saw sixth grade tried year ago my junior school found almost unbearable crew job at creating beautiful looking nightmare than horror have seen no message except that life sucks little good world end after nothing but sh*t happens your entire bear will eat people say was way pointless negative
how could such a great ensemble suck so much ? katie holmes naked . see the last five minutes of movie that's it sucked anal leakage
make a movie about tyson he is the greatest
this is the only movie that i have ever walked out of . story and characters were uninteresting just seemed to drag on it was boring
oh jezzzuz , anyone seeing this movie is a complete idiot and deserves kick in the ass . some people will undoubtly claim best performance ever by smith well duh ! he cant act so anything better than past cr p playing ali,,,,its like tom green albert einstein truly undeserving of major hero our times
ewww ! i would never ever waste my time on this movie again . cant believe wasted $7.75 it kept thinking the was going to get better but didnt soo boring.most of people in theatre walked out like half way thought dragged sooo bad-no mean reeeeaaal bad still dont understand point its all good
this film gets my vote for the most beautiful looking terrible of all time . it's like staring at a postcard 2 hours  ! every teeny-tiny detail that goes into making movie was wasted in case truly awful stuff
a group of five us went to see this movie , and only one walked out liking . not even the person who first suggested it liked it! ! matt damon gwenyth paltrow were absolutely wonderful but would have been better had they good script work with same thing happened over i think mr.ripley's personality confused himself was mundane boring worst i've seen since crying game 
the storyline had a lot of gaps . for instance , ripley's character was not completely developed in addition it rather long and began to drag towards end also very sad depressing
what a boring turkey ! it would be hard for any film to more pretentious and contrived than this one . my 13 year old son , martial arts master shunned he was right.unless you're into asians swinging around on cables alot skip movie dutchvu
the movie wasn't very real to me because of a lot factors . percussion work is impressive but too over done i think film made other people "oh cool , they must do that in drumline!" nah-uh nick cannon's not good actor
nowwwwwww  , denju not every movie like this ,needs my criticism .and rating isn't the only 1 ,or 2 star review .
where's mcgowan on this one ?
if there were negative numbers id give it a number but one is as low gets
the plot was horrible and special affects too unbelievable . acting did not help much either , especially males (chou yung fat or such)
jack nicholson always plays a crazy person well , but this film is bad . the movie starts low and goes lower darkness never lets up while point of pledge that drives man insane audience left completely unfulfilled by end i felt as though my time would have been better spent watching paint dry do not see unless course you already watched
one of the most disappointing movies i can recall . jack gave worst performance his career and it was a herendously slow boring movie character development is thing but just showing guy fishing isn't really entertaining first ten minutes were exciting then guess penn decided all action used up my friend that watched with me , fell asleep for time ever watching in theater if you haven't seen make pledge to yourself not do so
this is beyond wretched . gibson running around with his face painted blue makes me think he's trying to imitate some medieval glasgow rangers supporter an embarrassment anyone any real concept of scottish history or pride
i think i'm still suffering insulin shock from this sacchrine nonsense .
this rating is based on the movie itself , and not it being a religious rated by devout loudmouthed atheist . simply it's artistic merit passion wasn't any good acting seemed forced unemotional as for story i noticed several errors just to name few : flogging went too long believe romans practiced forty save one method of (i.e 39 lashes) counted well over fifty lashes didn't pound nails into hand they through wrist yes know showed jesus tied cross but done increased time took poor victim die peter's three denials could have been taken having all lumped together incident in reality were propably more spread out if was already dead why did blood water come with such force ? no heartbeat pushing very accurate film mel gibson should be ashamed at himself putting dreck
why should we care about this low life ?
a movie about pornographer ? i think not ! hustler , the supertrash magazine that this fool created is disguistingly sick as it was first to show full nudity . makes nut out be hero when he should locked up and focus on someone else has an open marriage with sex before married of course avoid r-rated terror at all costs watch any trek or star wars movies kill mockingbird for good dramatic here's hoping pornograhpy becomes illegal soon..
i wouldn't tip this caddy .
legend of uncle tom , more like .
a silly film with bad acting .
this movie did two things really well , it bored me and made upset i spent the 8 bucks on . agree that critics opinions aren't correct a lot of time they nailed one blew
my husband and i both thought this movie was terrible . the visuals were only good thing fight sceens to hokey with all flying why did girl take a horse when she trying save chow yun fat if could just fly through tree tops ? silly for words waste of $15.50
again , id rather eat crap than watch this movie a second time . wow i cant believe how much of waste film was its 3 and half hour or whatever have always liked sports films but one is too everything about it ridiculous even al pacino's performance
awful its in chineese or japanees whatever the hell that is horrible who makes a movie freacking chinees this america we speak english!!!!! !
i love the nfl and thought this movie did a horrible job of trying to deplict life in . it was demeaning intelligence both fans players
sorry but you can't sell me on cameron diaz.....umm she ain't that good looking not by a long shot , and there is no bigger turn off than some sour foul mouthed girl with downer attitude who's blames the world for her own screwups
this wasn't a good war movie . some things in are not true to history of the battle scenes , japanese soldiers appear be bad most couldn't kill american standing right front them reality were best trained entire world i think cage is too old play part he's almost 40 and playing marine sergeant for if your haven't noticed from watching everything off grenades make an explosion size artillery shell shown as having no hand combat skills terrible historical film
the cinematography made me really nauseous .
this movie sucked . i only watched it because of robert deniro , and his character was really boring that dragged on nothing happened
eminem is a poseur who would be slicing meat at deli if it weren't for dr . dre lesser-talented white artist propped up by the media to sell records and lame-ass predictable movies don't you know when you've been sold bill of goods ?
a horrible movie that is r-rated and promotes depravity all across the board , everyone should be ashamed of this trashy . boycott terror now ! eminem...arrested soon...let's hope
i think ted turner funded this so he could dress up in a confederate uniform . some excellent cinematography is utterly wasted tedious , overblown pompous sequel to the far more competent gettysburg
being a southerner , i was truly hoping that gods and generals would be good movie . believe me -- read the numerous negative reviews but decided to see myself because concluded yankees who did not appreciate southern history wrote however seeing huge mistake ! am exaggerating when say is one of worst movies have ever seen in my life anyone tells you this great complete denial at best serves as how video for civil war re-enactors nothing more sitting through four boring tedious hours torture again southerners are depicted arrogant far right wing extremist religious zealots with respect do yourself favor--stay home
after many succesful modern day shakespeare adpatations 10 things i hate about you (the taming of the shrew) , romeo and juliet 1996 version) hamlet 2000 they decided to grace our screens with this dribble . thought that it was far too ambitious using a high school as back-drop mekhi pfieffer for me brutal play othello josh hartnett made good iago julia stiles very moderate desdemona only exception rain phoenix who excellent amelia no thanks won't be watching again
is it all julia stiles can do films with interracial relationships ?? ? not being racist at , but enough already we get the point!!! !
this movie is a zero . what waste of time and money
i won't see this movie ever!! ! meg ryan is being black balled by me! she showed her true color's to son,her husband and the whole world! don't want give a penny of my money! no respect for family while was sleeping with russell crowe! thanks . you screwed up big time in book!
wretched , predictable claptrap . a waste of two hours
i just rented this movie by mistake , started to watch it anyway . in our video store was listed as a comedy the first 30 minutes were pretty unfunny.. but then there ben affleck soliloquy that so poorly done -- horrible acting and writing made me laugh hard suddenly realized why ran over here computer could give 5-star rating alas ria has drama guess i'll have judge from perspective
oh , you've got to be kidding me . why can't we have a minimum age requirement on the web? !
right down there as one of my least favourite films alongside gosford park , crouching tiger. . and mulholland drive like those a pretentious load cack with wafer thin storyline even thinner characters tom cruise's worst film to date that's saying something at godzilla make no pretence being anything intellectually stimulating in word..it's b*llocks
i heard a lot of bad things about this..and they're all completely justified - confusing , pretentious and overlong . the denouement was as much an irritating cop-out bobby ewing's dreaming whole one series in 'dallas'
couldn't hardly follow this movie . made no sense whatsoever
pathetic , especially with that stupid penelope cruz in it .
this is up there with one of the five worst movies i've ever seen . two hours my life i'll never get back ! for those you who think depicts real , i feel very sorry negative immoral movie was most depressing representation humanity have although it a study in bad decisions humans make every day their lives if what going on modern-day relationships generation however all experience see less kind muck and more people trying to behave used like clive owens weird thing he's happily married couple kids certainly didn't did anything jude law's or julia robert's careers then leave me out felt taking shower at end found so disgusting (and believe not i'm prude) know live way - new friends but too short waste no idea that happiness resides within jumping from bed
i found this a distateful little film,cold , cynical,clinical with no redeeming features whatsoever.i personally couldn't care for any one of the characters . it seemed an exercise in debasement four actors involved and does them favours
a good sci-fi movie . i grow tired of people constantly focusing on the sex scene & forgetting about how badly main characters treated their children was very sloppy hallie looked drugged up in ecstasy which is something never expected her look like this woman harbours such tremendous hypocrisy when she states hollywood racist turns around protrays some poor needy black who willing to sleep with my god where bottom am glad mom white
how did halle berry win a freagin oscar this movie is crap thwe was rigged they just wanted uhhh...ya know
after watching this piece of crap from beginning to end . i find myself asking why? !
this by far was the worst movie i have ever seen . someone please tell me why in world halle berry won an oscar for her role piece of crap not only wanted my money back after over but time spent watching returned too made! ! very bad choice! did they see same as me? ? would think not!!!
tuna and i agree that you should avoid this movie at all cost!! ! the dramatic moment was execution suicide . however halle/billy bob plot wasn't exciting they break up kiss blah also love writers for killing off kid so his mother can have more sex with old man.(sarcasm)
don't go see it . the local paper gave an a- minus part was right it's a story about people losing their hatred and bigotry falling in love masked tale of death , more even yes billy bob thornton is great character actor halle berry can act too we get confirmation for anyone that didn't already know she has body but to watch sucicides electrocutions parents ahting children telling them faces blechh
awful film with boring old mel gibson . historically inaccurate only good thing is the actor who plays king edward 1st
brando must have been hurting for money , such bull crap......a 1' minus. .
what a piece of formulatic crap . this movie is just another example that hollywood has run out ideas it serves no purpose other to have talentless actors showcase their bland personalities in badly written script , and highlight current rap music one will remember 5 years (except missy elliot) the dancing nothing new plot overused probably make some impact at box office but goes show intelligence going public i know isn't supposed be art formula movies should effort unique different
crap !
awful. .
i left the theatre feeling crappy . purposeless violence
unlike the novel by bret easton ellis , which is one of best pieces literature ever written man this movie was so horrible . i know not meant to have deep meaning it but could been close book obviously any true fan tell you don't think his books made into great movies date except for maybe less than zero do recommend waste space anyone :(
gross , sick disgusting no purpose and defiantely not worth the money to see or hire . sure it has great actor christian bale but doesn't do anything for audience is also at most points confusing u get mixed up with what real unreal a bit of weird movie that isn't look just read title american psycho
a horrible movie about man with pefect life who hates it so much he pretends to be others and murders people in gruesome fashion . redeeming factor- threesome two girls
this movie is the equivalent of a soft porno . end leaves you confused and lesbian sex makes queasy other than that , acting was alright but still didn't makeup for rest
based on brett easton's equally absurd book , this turkey belongs in the elite class of films like ishtar heaven's gate hudson hawk etc . granted it does accurately portray greedy power-hungry self-centered stepford wife mentality 80's yuppie wall street crowd but everything else is pathetic christian bale was too old for lead role and his acting beyond terrible willem dafoe great reese witherspoon were wasted their small roles failed miserably at it's attempt to get real deep psychological so movie tries even harder fails worse did he or didn't angle a idea neither author nor director had talent pull off then make tried look 'artsy'...puh-lease !!.. i think every copy pitiful should be burned what waste time effort
they tried to make the movie too deep . it was a good idea for but turned out horrible very confusing and just dumb got boring watch crazy guy getting crazier killing people over again
this movie totally sucked . there was no plot what so ever and the actors didn't do their best it nothing that i expected at all to be a suspense/horror film main character really psycho murder scenes were very grusome
there is a real david gale up here in canada he wasnt pleased they named this movie like that the host of cooking show called loving spoonfuls syndicated but luckily film tanked wont be associated with such terrible character spacey portrayed
about a bunch of teenage or teenage-wannabe potheads.. . bah humbug
ugh . what an amazing disappointment ! there's nothing worse than going to see a movie you expected was be good , and it all ends up blowing in your face like bomb i cannot believe saw this completely crappy pointless i'm sorry if being crude here but just so disappointing leo make fool out of himself paid 5 freaking bucks 1.) have my friends joke me for about week (because the one who made them go it) 2.) no at trust when would say hey looks let's (no matter reffering to) 3.) sit 2 hours that seemed longest life discover had myself by actually dragging along (atleast wouldn't been only suffering) feel unwanted can't describe anymore deserves 0.1 lowest 1 i'll compromise
yo matt likes this move so it must suck!!!!! !
a lot that i just didn't need here . little of what the movie needed those rebels on beach tore script , or smoked weed island (actually that's certainty.)
hopefully they cannot find any more pieces of crap by stanley kubrick . as always , this one is junk like the rest his movies i do not recommend it to anyone will just leave you feeling empty and bad...
i cannot believe this movie made the top 100 list . it should not be in 1,000 ! is a self-indulgent , vague badly-acted piece of tripe that no way deserved preamble and hype got casting cruise kidman together was perhaps it's biggest downfall.. two them seem to spend most time trying out-act each other patently uncomfortable throughout almost as though team who put sat down thought likely ingredients for big audience hey - kubrick 3 hours long artfully plot let's do (no thank you!) eyes wide shut has dubious honour being only have ever walked out oh tried god knows but 90 minutes more than enough convince me had come across one boring movies motion picture history
strange movie . i wasted my money renting it
there is no point in this movie .
this movie was a lame attempt at trying to be shocking through sex and nudity . i've had kinkier parties than that , that's no lie story didn't excite me or entertain it dull people should have orgies from time it's good for the ego i would say could gone in so many other directions make tale an interesting one doesn't more movies need made tease sexual psyche of like kubrick just not last his
very boring movie filled with a bunch of nudity and sex . i fell asleep wouldn't recommend this to anyone good cast ,
the plot is not clear and acting was that great .
what ? was that porno don't know going on . drove me carzy the best thing in whole movie seeing nicole kidman naked and i'm straight !
are you kidding me ? did see this movie i'm not sure where to start . and a bad is even worth long review but i feel the need do my civic duty warn people who thinking about renting : don't make same mistake made ! if ever find yourself wanting rent , have friend hog-tie until come your senses really - awful it's in funny way boring overly dramatic what was tom cruise his character (along with all others) just likeable nor he unlikeable love hate hard enjoy when can't empathize any of characters poor kubrick how can director clockwork orange deteriorate so much proper story decent directing acting might been ok kidman had nothing work they put their faith laid an egg on them
nothing that i can say make this movie seem worst then it already is . one of the stupidest movies i've ever watched
ironically , this is what i said when heard that jennifer lopez was in another movie .
horrible movie with ridiculous , phony acting .
truly horrible . bad acting every cliche in the book dunst strutting around tight , little shirts and panties for 2 hours wasn't enough to make this movie worthwhile
this movie made me hate richard gere even more . i could never see winona fall in love with aperson like there was no cemistry
that was the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life . there no plot whatsoever and story line very shallow pathetic hated this !
this was one of the worst movies that i have ever seen . it depressing and bad acting
sucked . it is difficult to get over the fact that richard 48 and winona 22 additionally , ricahard dated winona's mom how are we supposed swallow !
this movie was just plain unadulterated terrible , shame on winona and richard for ever agreeing to do . i hope gets real fat that goes bald...my wife suffered through were both discusted waiting eddie scissorhands come rescue something
i maybe remember seeing bits and pieces of this movie when was younger . like robert redford don't get me wrong , but to imagine any chemistry between him barbara streisand blows my mind keep watching for be on amc sometime have never been able catch it seems one the those movies guess that not aged well with time
maudlin nonsense that portrays the hollywood witch hunts as an inconvenience similar to not being able get a table in fashionable restaurant . streisand and redford have same profound chemistry you can see between department store window manniquins
this movie is nothing but degradation to african americans , and a mockery of white .
ponderous , portentious and pretentious . use one of the feathers to tickle back your throat you can bring up this load garbage
one of the most boring , dry and joyless movies our time .
vanity fair is a cure for your insomnia . 2 hours of boring fluff !
i'd sooner take a fastball to the berries than see five minutes of this again .
its for movies like this that i wish you could vote lower than 1 . what can say-horrible acting , dialogue storyline...it just sucked no wonder justin left britney should always get off a sinking ship
horrible!!! !
this award-worthy movie is a total disgrace...now we all know that britney can't sing or act . well , what would you expect from pop star bases her whole career on lip-synching and bellybutton ? stop acting but please don't go back to your day job either
up until this movie , harrison ford had the most spotless list of good movies that any actor would only dream having . some say may have started a chain lacklustre with later titles such as what lies beneath and hollywood homicide be true biggest problem wth main reason why it's so bad is concept two different people meet one another because strange simultanious deaths their lovers that's it ! there no real plotline to follow on audience left resolution you might well ends 30 minutes into in mind anyone watching will state bordem drains life out them reminder time do yurelf favor pass pick sabrina remake before
hopeless ! this movie you would think is going to be great because of harrison ford , but it a shocker that just drags on and . i walked out i've never in my life has good idea doesn't reach climax or leave the edge your seat slow isn't worth watching even if someone paid avoid at all costs!
anyone who actually liked this movie should be dragged out and shot . defication of a was almost the worst i have ever seen to bitches that like , suck my child shooter...spooge
the constant flashbacks were annoying and unclear . i mean , after jumping back forth through time find myself putting pieces together since it seemed as though all of scenes just slapped ending was predictable realizing that only katie holmes sees bad guy watching this movie from beginning to end wished had hit me over head with a rock left for dead
it's too new yorkie . that elitist stlye has been around in movies since the silent days please stop
more like afterbirth , as in this stinkeroo was about yucky the stuff . though i would have given it 2 stars because didn't sleep through my wife actually booed heartily cut to credits horrid movie had no mystery suspense or scary moments (theme : married dude dies jogging and is reincarnated a creepy little 10-year-old boy who insists he widow's dead husband finacee (who real schmuck) not amused) nicole kidman plays goofy widow/bride-to-be gets mucked up some mary kay latournoesque scenes (which really grossed out wife) since so stinky am happy give plot away but mixed-up kid whose head becocked by games anne heche character best can tell either dude's mistress first something don't even know) one lives happily ever after particularly viewers has been 3 atrocities row (dogville stepford wives stinker) think her judgement impaired leaving tom cruise birth need of an abortion
this has got to be the worst movie ever . i was so looking forward seeing it and could not believe that wasted my money on
could possibly be one of the most mindless movie 2000 .
boring much ? i really wanted to like this film but just kept getting more and annoyed . didn't have any sympathy for whiny bunch of rich folks become engaged in the story at all thought richard gere's character was pretty vacant a with so many familiar names on marquee , totally unremarkable think that altman is an acquired taste anyway can usually get into flow his films one left me hanging waiting punchline tragedy something liven up lifeless excuse movie
i so wish there was a rating below one star . my kind husband brought this movie home to me after mentioned would like see it looking forward snuggling in early and watching some of favorite actors actresses also laughing great deal suffice say the complete joke , that not funny least however have no idea who talked these skilled into participating but they should given their salaries back pay production company burn film it's worth renting trust
i rate this film terrible with the same confidence that gave murderous dictator joseph stalin a one-star ranking in another ria category . star-studded cast like (helen hunt , richard gere kate hudson farrah faucet laura dern etc...) you'd think there would be something redeeming about plot characters anything ! is nothinig good to say issue challenge find very worst i've seen except perhaps for caddyshack ii last unicorn and dark crystal actually may have been better than
one word - brutal !
i thought it was a parody myself .
this was a drama ?
lame title , movie . i can't believe some people actually liked this piece of garbage !
you are joking right?what kind of people watch this nonsense?how do movies like get the $20,000 that it cost to make ?
stupid! !
the most stereotypical drawn out , movie ever . this was worst than a master p
worst.movie.ever .
they're running this hideous thing on television now . so , i thought i'd see what all the negative hype was about and watched part of it can't believe ; these two dinks actually managed to come up with a new film genre - comic porn both sad funny
if totalitarianism is like a boot stamping on human face forever , then this movie surely for two hours .
a 1.5 . i will give it an extra half point because gigli at least did not hurt the mentally disabled person he kidnapped othewise this is flat out boring movie dialogue awful plot stupid even though do think that jennifer lopez great actress , have seen her act better in other movies she was convincing as tough hit woman ben affleck came on talk show and said very good glad only spent 99cents to try one
i didn't see it but know sucks .
this puerter rican cant act for sh*t
ahh gigli...i like saying gigli . suck mine to the people that this anyone would rather slip on some ice and split their head open it be less painfull humane douche bags
this is absolute trash!! ! it well...gigli for god sake .
oh my god ! i am so damn sick of hearing about jlo and affleck let it die stupid media
truly deserves a zero . terrible the worst
my girlfriend had advance tickets thanks to a contest . i begged her not take me pleaded with go we went ben is killer for hire (?) who wants seduce the lesbian-killer j-lo (!?) in one of worst films have ever seen dialouge god-awful  .when gets ready perform oral sex on she says it's turkey time , gobble ! can't make this stuff up laughed because numb pain sitting through horrible movie worse than waterworld ishtar and even wedding planner .i think i'll pop taxi driver right now remember what decent film looks like need smelling salts anyway gigli bad
terribly over-rated and over-acted !
worst movie i've ever seen..... . the kid would have figured out that something was up.... it not worth time
this is the most overrated foreign film ever . moral of story seems to be : if something bad happening , lie about it make life into a game and you'll hero by far dishonest depiction holocaust that i have seen
excrement on a stick . no , retract that not quite good
terrible
boring , depressing and very confusing .
boring
a very depressing , dark and dangerous movie the features not only downer of theme but boatloads profanity violence sexual innuendo . for good mystery watch murder she wrote or columbo this klaptrap

awful movie with a screwed up history , lots & of errors mel gibson (william wallace)would have been 350 years old this hollywood boloney... .
a horrible movie . i can't believe sat through the whole thing it was painful
kudos to you andyrue . i agree 100% with your comment
like the book it was based on , left behind : movie just shows how arrogant some christians can be about their faith . for thousands of years people have been saying that world is going to end soon but still here same true today not come an any time despite what this pretentious film tries convince its audience anyone who says contains truth a liar they could possibly know and dishonest claim otherwise
this was a boring movie . the acting bad , plot and storyline difficult to follow idea good but it not executed well do waste your money rent thing
typical french film . slow moving , muted dialogue incomprehsible plot..it's all here the only one of trology worth bothering with is blue and because lovely juliette binoche
a dismal movie
the american version seems oscar-worthy in comparison to original .
the ring was a terrible , horrible movie that too long . it didnt explain anything and just may have been worst of all time is until japanese version ringu came downright awful
awful . a script so full of cliches it could have been written by grade seven student might better if had
most overrated movie of all time . it's not just that scary , but a good
inaccurate twaddle .
this is soooooo stupid !
this has to be the worst horror movie i've ever seen ! i wasn't scared once , didn't care about any of characters and killer was laughable . just sitting there thinking : is it ? considered one greatest when nothing interesting happened nope i'd rather watch dentist 2 again
stupid
verry dum .
stupid
didn't like it at all . jack nicholson is a great actor but the other cast members weren't that good i just hated storyline
this sucked
when i think of this movie , one word comes to mind : yicky !
this was supposed to be a horror film , but kubrick's ego forced him attempt an artsy comical with those absurd hidden messages all combined the and he did ruin actual tale from novel make proposterous movie . truly pathetic stuff
the only good thing about this movie is it's 2 stars performances . sucked !
most overrated horror movie of all time . this wouldnt scare my poodle bad make up acting and everything else bride chucky was scarier than joke a if i in the room with that possessed girl would have pooped on her face laughed
i will never see his abomination of a film as long live!!!it is the most satanic horror ever!!!my 10th grade math teacher was huge fan,but she hated this one 'cause it 100%blasphemy!!!she says couldn't believe they got child to play role!!!and my mom thinks that's tragic well!!!also,i cannot would tell god;my father f--- you!!!she outta be shot for saying that!!!i have heard lot bad things about godawful film!!!true christians such myself need stay far away from film!!!because subject matter!!!people "the passion christ" instead!! !
stupid

not at all scary . i am sorry , but a 12 year old kid is just to me this movie way overrated
this film is just disturbimg you need scary exciting entertaining and have a good time to make horror disturbing .
i never watched this and don't think missed a thing .
mainly stupid
don't watch this movie !
i hate this film...it is not scary but it makes you paranoid
i did not find it scary . thought was funny , but must admit that linda blair totally convincing as hillary clinton
not scary , all around it wasnt good
yawn...i saw this movie when i was eight and it totally bored me to death...i almost fell asleep ! however my 2 something year old stepbrother is still terrified that he's gonna get possesed .
if you like this movie something must be wrong with . it's a sick litle that insults the good christain name don't waist your'e time on disgusting junk
i know this movie was made when born and would probably have been scared all but saw it a couple of years ago laughed don't see nothing scary about .
this movie is a shocker , and totally one hundered pecent not scary . i am 9 year old boy poo if anything hilarious especially the girl going down stairs omen far better !
could be the most overrated movie of all time . that whold climactic scene is retarted that's a fact
one of the most overrated movies ever !
this movie wasn't even scary !
love stephen king , hate this book and movie !
this is one those movies i only whant to see once . didnt enjoy movie because it was a very dark and weird
i don't understand what is so scarry this movie? ? she gave them they deserved in a more gifted & clever way!! !
have rented a dvd and watched it while ago . the movies is way too outdated , those scenes look rather gross than scary carri was clueless about periods at her age when she already graduating from high school oh dear
what is soo great about this movie i dont see anything
hated the book . hate movie king should have quit years before this mindless drivel bates did ok with what she had to work gore does not equal horror is an emotion blood and guts spewing on screen that doesn't scare me
misery was a horror movie ? i thought is cheesy drama .
this was stupid not scary or interseting just boring
pa-thet-ic
i fell asleep halfway through this crap . it and the exorcist are 2 least scary movies have seen
omg , how can this movie possibly be tied in rating with the best scary ever exorcist ? i swear to god is worst horror flick have watched my life . whole was expecting something freak me out.. but it never came!! ! horrible!!
just stupid .
stupid
the worst movie ever . it is directed by some loser pollak director , roman polaksky or something no clive barker and sign of those brilliant actors freddy kruger iii sir jason voorhes j.honeyman-pinhead from hellraiser i cried when ended one was disemboweled tortured to death this what clean toilets all day for ? be ripped off fancy-pants foreign polak directors?? where my valium?!?!
this movie should not be classified as a scary . it trippy or strange the ending is pretty inconclusive and its at all
what kind of horror movie is this . i've never heard one
january 15 , 2004 . i saw the first trailer for dawn of dead remake asked my father about he said yeah it's an old zombie movie made in 70s later figured out that it was greatest ever march 14 stupidest thing had seen(and i've seen house dead) terrible acting unrealistic zombies no action pointless where near as good this sucked almost all romero's movies suck night living and a couple non-zombie did they do not watch
this movie is just not scary .
bad this sucked not a classic piece of crap
how can this rate higher than the 1974 original ? have fans of remake even seen version that is a drive-in classic , real product its time----graphic without being in-your-face gritty darkly funny beautifully shot and edited . viewer actually feels "dirty" after watching it none above--just exploitation heck i'll take renee zellweger "remake" from 1994 over thing
first of al it never happened tobe hooper said himself second all the original is way better this depends on jump tactics and boring predictibal "scream" type suspence while was a step into bizzare nature showing how cannibals act so see listen to commentary they say them selfs
one line for you..... . never screw with classics! !
awful remake...don't waste your time on this crap .
awful , like the first !
hated it !
that was a terrible movie!! ! i can not believe you thought , scary!! is astupid
i cant believe this is as high it in the ratings- its such a non-scary movie! ! think pathetic - so boring almost fell asleep . together with bad acting and an unbelievable plot but holy water waterpistols cmon! crap!
if you want to get scared watch halloween not this garbage .
wow this sucked . horrible acting by no name actors and wes craven must have been asleep behind the camera to create such a stupid movie ready here is an easy formula for anyone interesed in making horror films- gore does not equal scary!! ! go out watch shining instead
one word , bad . it may scare kids but it's just the film quality is horrible characters are shallow and story thin only redeeming factor rober englund who can somehow turn any character into something interesting
let's see , a bunch of people you are never given any reason to care about knocked off one by in variety grisley ways . whoopee pretty much sums up the modern slasher film general if you're that into blood and gore why not just sit on an overpass pray for car wrecks
ooooohhhhh nnnooooo . you just did not put this piece of trash before the omen..or even freaking lost boys , for that matter johnny depp's acting was horrendous and campy (even when one considers he pretty much everything with his part could.)and it seemed almost as painful him to say those bland terrible lines me listen them legend sleepy hollow is a horse beaten death..why can't we let rest in peace ? what really rubs wrong way,though tim burton directed film don't make masterpiece like nightmare christmas then do..whatever hell if want fully experience said tale read book by washington irving please see movie oh christopher honey.. why no would do yourself?..
not good at all
avoid like the plague . trash.......*vomit
let's see now , we'll take some anne rice dreck add hearthrobs cruise pitt banderas and slater mix it altogether what we get . trash ! avoid
what halloween should be number one not this junk
this movie is boring and it a amature horror so predictable .
i think it'll take a 5 star as comdey movie . but would give it 3 for the stupid silly story !.
about as scary seeing dog droppings from another in your yard .
this movie almost single handedly ruined the slasher genre . it sucks
not good , now watch texas chainsaw masacure that was a pretty movie !
sorry , i like to be scared by horror films
oh , the awful trend this crap started .
this was the worst movie series ever . it wasn't scarry in least just plain stupid
i have had more fun fly fishing ! the only good part of this movie was randy but course as in all crappy movies best guy dies sequel (which a great thing for randy) . may liked it back day that before started to understand what made if you find try shakeing pen front computer screen might think stabbed deep man.
one of the worst movies ever made in horror history .
the shape just absolutely cannot stand this flick , and he really doesn't have a nice long explanation as to why either . thinks it's suckiest sucky movie that ever sucked
scream...what can i say . loved it in 8th grade am a senior know and my likes have changed was an original concept liked for that did one good character could relate to randy the horror movie geek yea him but he is such tiny sub only few patrons even cared about cried eyes out when watched scream 2 couple times just sleak well shot fairly o.k acted not this more of action than anything else.if you want be scared don t come any closer if wish put your brain into cruise control watch tediouse time filler with whippdey doos right ! oh yeah! almost forgot film what brought teeny bopper loses major points by hilfiger...where gun ?
scream was a really stupid movie . it got more boring as the proceeded
this movie sucked . it wasn't scary at all they should've kept to one save tape once again the plot was so boring i actually fell asleep during
i hate scary movies . don't get scared really easily and find it pointless to watch , a waste of time all the sequels scream are same
i'm sorry , i didn't find this film at all scary . a kid getting sucked into the tv ? oh come on !
extremely dissapointing movie . i had heard lots of hype about this film and decided to rent it boy was dissapointed there is little horror in , even less suspense if you are looking for a scare forget piece fluff
what do people see in this empty movie besides a great strobe light show  ?
this movie has no heart soul , it relys entirely on special effects which unfortunately started a trend in hollywood horror movies . jobeth williams was very good though
terible not my kind of movie weird strange and i was thinking what is going on did even finish it good
one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life ! o stars
one of the worst movies i ever seen . i'm surprized it stuck to tape !
a crappy , overrated movie with the overly annoying nicole kidman .
this movie sucked!! ! am i the only one who was actually watching???? ? falling asleep! when over jumped up yelling hallelujah
sucks !
others ?
i saw this one when a long time ago so don't recall much about it except girl running away from maniac and screaming to death the whole my mom loves that part eh ma ha :)
too base even to be campy , this waste of celluloid has absolutely nothing recommend it . i'd willing bet is the top cult horror pick dukes hazzard crowd down at ye-ha university though
don't ever watch this movie . it has a terrible plot , effects and even worse acting the whole series drags on i regret wasting my time money renting watching
this movie gave me vivid nightmares for a week . it had no plot , just gore and blood psychopaths i saw the almost two years ago still get goosebumps when think about
even the presence of hopkins can't salvage this naff film . attempt at accents are laughable quite simply a farce
over-rated .
sorry folks , but this movie sucked . hey i love francis ford coppola and gary oldman winona ryder as much anyone out there was just bad the costumes were terrible (excepting of course that see-through nightgown ms ryders) acting not very good it bombed in theaters has no business making list so high a forgettable piece junk
this movie was bad to the point of being offensive . and what is idea making dracula's head look like a big powdered butt ? i feel wasted my time only redeeming value that can advise people not watch it
visually stunning , but poorly written and horribly acted . keanu winona were miscast they can't do the accents !
way too silly not scary just a rip off of halloween and if you took away the direction atmoshere acting music intence feelin brilliant mood add some blood gore leave in style there go got friday 13'th
a slasher flick for sadists .
i have seen some of this movie but it is just a rip-off halloween they tried to take the juicy eerie scary feeling and add in horrible story women nudity blood gore . so other words do not waste youre time on you are way more better watching extremley classic john carpentetrs moviehalloween
awful , . nick cage's worst movie and this is the guy who made con air magnetic boots that hold prisoners in place ? what am i six years old
cheap . can i stress that enough?? ? god , the only money they spent making these friday 13th stuff was on a hockey mask and an old jumpsuit truly dissapointing there are some good moments though
it seems this is the movie that started trend of using gore as a cheap way to create shock . horror genre has never been same since thanks
this film is a blatant ripoff of psycho by simply reversing the mother/son rolls and acting was appauling . even worse it begot zillion sequals
just a rip off of halloween and who knows what else . boring tripe
the absolute pits in horror movies . not one good comment about this no-brainer  !
all my fans know that im from mn i love hockey . this movie $ucks , woulda rather watched the ncaa finals ! go wild if your not a goalie only thing left to be is fruit>
i would rank this as the most boring movie have ever seen . scary ?? ? for a 7 y/o possibly
i have a question about this movie : the whole thing is that if you make copy of tape , wont die . (it was discovered at end) rachel made begining but why through out entire having all these symptoms and signs as she going to ? (bloody noses blurry picture hair coming her throat etc.)it's hard for me watch thinking
you mean all have to do is make a copy of the tape and you're safe ? what if gave someone would they still copied it onto dvd over one youre dukes hazzard episodes rosco p.coltraine step out tv . that be sweet
i just watched this movie last night . way too much hype ; even my friend at blockbuster recommended it to me the little girl that was in on fox morning and she laughed when interviewer seemed surprised her mom let watch because supposed be so scary may minority here , but have agree with axelrod2003 can someone tell where part ? also bigbaby ending totally sucked many unanswered questions pieces didn't fit together as though director had several ideas going once couldn't decide which direction go a very sad disappointment if you want say for is your money
i hated the f***ing thing ! it was so darn scary got me jumpy that wasn't even funny ending worst have seen in years . what is with modern horror movies and bad endings ? first jeepers creepers now this why did they to kill guy he only cool movie that's totally not how would end a just wanna say part of reason scared much nasty mean dead bodies didn't be ugly.. bigbaby right , too many unanswered questions think horrors should while you watch them supposed rid viewer all fear because everything explained my butt considering actually rip-off other japanese its identical copy one might director has done poor job message directors : please don't make senseless
bad movie . it was allright until the ending coming out of tv at end and killing guy completely ruined who made videotape ? what thing on horses about too many unanswered questions to be good wasen't a tad bit scary
if i could give this movie a minus rating , would . sucked so bad got my money back at the ticket booth ! don't waste your time on one or absolutely horrible they just make horror movies with any real in them nowadays last that actually made me pick feet up off floor sheer terror was exorcist  do yourself favor rent classic and hold honey tight
quite possibly the worst movie ever , except maybe for scary 2 . made no sense whatsoever i am still trying to figure out who videotape or how why little girl was so evil
as someone else said - great plot , potential boring an eternity in hell and acting that makes you want to claw your eyes out . not british films best however shaun of the dead is would recommend seeing 28 days later it embarasses us brits even more oh soldiers are like
i am sorry but have to disagree with every single one of these comments . maybe if the ads for this movie were different rating would be a 3 everyone was saying scariest since excorsist yeah , right is zombie that not scary at all it seemed like scene pitch black its very difficult find out what happening love movies showed how many zombies ? 5 looked normal people just little blood on thier face starts off horrid ; animal rights activists cause disease spread after good until action which where gets dark finally too questions unanswered hate idea modern day night living dead turns non-scary mess lives !
over-rated and lame . this movie bored me
how can a horor movie with john ritter (no offense) be good ?
ahhhhhhh ! oh my god! this movie scared the crap outta me! i couldn't sleep because of stupid , creepy clown that was so freaky and scary extremly gosh everytime see in store scream for real!
really , bad film . the older it gets dumber seems
this movie was gory and offensive to religion . i have no idea how it got be in the top 20 , but sure doesn't deserve
you're kidding right
this was not a horror movie . i got so bored couldn't finish watching it blah
not a top 20 horror film .
why the hell is this in top 20
a pathetic attempt to exploit religion and make movie.poo .
you people are so thirsty for a good horror film seem to settle cheap hour and half long x-file knock off garbage . i saw this the night it was realesed with high hopes of great exorcist like wanted be jolted frightened give me something think about instead got another budget attempt at money making is prpackaged cotton candy crap ! my i.q dropped 10 points just from witnessing such an attrocity ashamed am all religion in cinema myself not religious man even though raised christian house hold can see how some message stigmata opens peoples eyes new world but those must realize they seeing based lame fictitious movie that no solid evidence made make schmuks who believe tabloids paranoid sad stuff,man..
this movie sucks . the only thing that scared me were doves i didn't like it was messing with my religion
a stupid movie that made religion look like joke . it the bible nothing was bad , and actors even worse
this movie sucked ! i thought that the plot was a little far-fetched and patricia arquette wasn't great . romance between her priest unbelievable trailers made me think it about something else
this is the sorriest movie i've ever seen . too predictable and redundant bad acting not even scary !
godawful sequel .
definitely a film you either love or hate . it did not appeal to me the storyline is unfocused main character full of himself and relatable special effects are laughable
john woo proved that he can make horrible films with this one . completely unplausible , the story is garbage not to mention sappy crap thrown in nick cage's love interest plus chase scene was ridiculously stupid don't waste your time on film
the title says it all , really .
this was a stupid movie .
crap ! the only reason it got one star was cuz johnny in it..and hes awesome.. .
boring , ! if i could have had the chance to give it a 0 would .
john woo proves once again that he is the worst diector ever . this joke of a movie features nonsensical story line , highlighted by boring dialogue and awkward action sequences only value brought was knowledge nicholas cage can dodge upwards 2,000 bullets per second
awful a good idea ruined by terrible acting hip young stars and overly gory effects .
funniest horror movie i have ever seen . i'm in favor of originality but when someone dies because muderous toilet water don't tend to take the too seriously still can't believe that they made a sequel with killer
highly over rated . while it does deliver it's fair share of campy fun , this is otherwise a boring movie good mention should be made for slaughtering the pretty little blonde girl half way through with an out control city bus...very creative !
this movie really sucked . i don't think it even tried to scare anyone it's just an excuse show some ridiculously unbelievable and over-elaborate deaths the end is what bugged me most a bunch of losers these 'filmmakers' are
pure exploitation . the actors who appeared in this should be ashamed of themselves
i had very high expectations for this film based on not only the hype , but everyone knew saying it was great horror . to me that's an insult genre thing give credit it's advertising a low budget that did well suspense extent kept you waiting suspense...but never comes ! acting hurt movie severely movies just don't work with terrible and as plot twist at end let say anyone who's seen silence of lambs wasn't shocked in least stop reading here if really want see without knowing ending let's think about what exactly would purpose be having dead guy laying middle floor throughout entire why is he there ? there's point unless...*gasp*...he's tricky like excess gore yourself being terribly twisted few almost shots sawing his leg off aftermath jawbreaker didn't do much...come big lame so disappointing
way too gory for a comic book hero type movie ! in general , the sucks .
this movie was pointless . the plot typical didn't make any sense it tried too hard took parts from other movies and to put together as one
how did this get under the title horror movies ? blade was biggest joke i've seen in a long time . i feel sorry for wesley snipes , that's going to take live down
this movie sucked ! it had the worst music , and storyline was horrible .
the beginning of end for romero's classic zombie flicks . all these return of.. movies did was make a joke out what truly creepy horror series waste !
sucks big time nowhere near as good the original overated
i liked this movie better when it was released under its original title mogwai droppings
the only thing scary about this movie is fact that it exists . seems you either love or hate q tarantino's work , and i guess fall in latter camp gratuitous violence t a don't really do much like script originated from role-playing game gone terribly awry doesn't just switch gears halfway through mutates into bad vampire (not i've seen many good ones but man one probably of worst) if stuff might be alright otherwise i'd suggest new
wow , what an awful movie . i mean really miserable as shallow this sounds rented from dusk till dawn because the ads featured salma hayek dancing around scantily clad and it turns out that was only part of worth watching plot is idiotic acting worse than you'd expect bad tv it's not at all scary attempts humor fall completely flat if any could almost recommend something to laugh but even enough be good
this is one of the worst movies i have ever watched . for some reason , it until bitter end guess was hoping praying begging a twist thinking there no way that movie can really be awful acting joke plot bordered on hilarious (not compliment so-called horror movie) and writing bomb from very beginning if you want to see bunch actors in their roles with effects..go waste couple hours your life rent dusk till dawn !
again.... . don't screw with the classics!! ! why try to immitate ? be an inovator , not immitator romero can't even do like he used original night dawn and day of dead movies were creative fresh scary new crap just wants flood screen gore
i'm sure it would be a good movie for people who like horror movies and such , but i saw the ad was terrified ! looks really freaky if liked (which don't) love this now you wouldn't catch me dead (no pun intended) watching .
has to be one of the worst horror films ever made .
silly not scary
i did not like this movie at all .
one of the worst movies i've ever seen .
terrible
es injusto que esta pelcula est en primer lugar . simplemente los promedios deberan ponderarse con un ndice corrector por la cantidad de opiniones
are u kidding me ? this film sucks a root!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
verry dumb
get this movie off the scary list please . its a mystery , not horror flick plus really blows i wouldnt watch again if someone gave me $40 bucks
sorry , i really disliked this craptastic movie . it's nothing but a waste of time
i dont get it...hey what the hell is going on ? boy this stupidest movie ever .
this is stupid how could you compare to halloween was not even a slasher it almost nothing like and john carpenter said he never heard of black christmas until years after movie verry unsuccfull unpopular can with comparing fast food gorme watch
just stupid .
i can't decide which is the worst movie ever made , this or strangeland . only good thing about that got it with a free coupon although feel should have been paid to watch don't waste your time
the first one was bad . this is worse
not scary  .
the sequels to this movie were even dumber than originals . these people can't act in a horror
i thought this movie was horrible . the plot very boring to me it like watching first one all over again , and ending same whole followed wasn't even that scary
this movie proved the theory that scary sequels suck . it's almost as if they thought of story filmed it had little intelligence and couldn't live up to first one
no matter how many scream movies will be made , they all horrible . every 'unexpected' spook and fright can seen a mile away when someone is walking through the dark camera on close-up of course chick turn around to find there don't go get scared you should take your girl so she hold
oh my ! people r gonna be sorry i rated this one . who could actully find movie entertaining theres ass raping on here thats sick to fan : im couldnt make you laugh with , movies disgusting love all killabuds4every1
i had very high expectations of this film given the calber actors . what a let down real snore !
not near as disgusting alot of people told me prior to watching it . they made sound like a movie that had be seen , was just gross i thought one the worst b-rated movies year...and still wished wouldn't have watched pure cinema torture...not actor did good job...should been shelved...horrid  !
made no sense at all
i only have one thing to say , poopy !
puke ! this film is totally boring and overrated .
i hated this movie . the ending sucked and to me it didnt make a whole lot of sense but thats my opinion kids liked
what was the point of that movie anyway ? i wasn't even scared , just very confused.. .
at first it was creepy and kinda scary . then made a turn for the worse all of sudden , didn't get much better from that point on ending just horrible one worst endings i have seen in horror movies long time am scared to watch sequel hope doesn't suck as bad this bleah
jeepers creepers why did you kill my peepers ? this was a horrible movie that made no sense.the premise could have for good but didn't execute.a sequal is due later year.save your money !
this is like a childrens storybook made into horror movie . haha how utterly pathetic !
i got this movie on a free rental nearly fell asleep over it was plain stupid not scary dont rent
i spent most of the time trying to figure out what that piece crap was and then got bored walked .
omg horrible! ! i thought it was incredibly stupid and my friends must of rolled our eyes laughed through the whole thing . well at least did
terribly rip-off of texas chainsaw massacre .
ha ha!!!... . ha.. it was funny
if you're looking for a scary movie , stay away from this one . i had saw critic rate it as the scariest i've seen in years  which is why went and over couple of others mind however instead getting scares got disappointment unless course your opinion movies like scream
really stupid .
cute with alot of black comedy . jason looked horrible and the movie wasn't too good at mixing fun violence i felt sorry for re headed counsler who got splattered all over her cabin see friends
this is the stupidest movie i have ever seen  , well. . if that excluding cider house rules. lol
afauwl terrible acting poorly scripted wierd mood messy dericting rip off of friday the 13th strang corny feel boring weird strange ending this has got to be one worst horror movies i have ever seen
so darn corny ! let's take off our clothes we can here better my husband commented to the kids searching woods . i can't believe wasted almost two hours of life on this
this movie has horrible acting and to be one of the worst horror movies ever made . i never completely watched it because in first 30 minutes or so was filled with some perverted scene a cook little girl at camp
this wasn't a horror movie . was just dumb
good performance from richard gere cannot even touch upon how horrible this film really is .
my son saw this movie on friday , and says it's not worth the money .
i waited and for the action that never came . this movie was slow dull , almost as if they were writing it went along
not enough people killed in this one .
generally i've liked the king mini series on television but this one just doesn't live up to past successes like it , salem's lot and a less extent storm of century . covering familiar territory with nothing new at table makes for uninteresting viewing casting show is weak as well (i shouldn't even notice that i did)
couldn't get through 20 m's of this one . awful !
also a terrible movie !
wicker man ? whatever .
warning to my loyal fans : this is an art movie , not a sado-slasher . don't even bother clicking the helpful button guys i still have 158 horror movies review !
movie seemed like it was 4hrs long . there were about 3 lines spoken in that4hrs & none of them made sense!! ! great director terrible movie! don't waste your brain , just grind up make pencil eraseres!!!
ehhhhh...just not worth it
crapola . a shameless rip off of duel , the hitcher and just about every other manipulative horror flick '90s (even though this came out in 2001) roger ebert gave it four stars was he on crack ?
i hate this movie . it is not scary whatsoever and the whole plot of stupid
i fell asleep .
this movie sucks ! the only reason anyone went to see it is j.l.h . who did a good job in an all around bad truly just pop fad
it would be better with some sex .
i...i just don't understand why anyone would give this over one star . people cheered for such an atrocity scare factor - 0 suspence likeable character bad guy you can at least root because the charactors and actors all suck so add to overall poonessity of peice teeny bopper bubble gum bullsh*t a movie usually if slasher flick sucks there is killer kill off dorkass kids in as big loser he's trying ! he gets hung up on fishing net ? kills everyone with ease but can't even catch jennifer love hewitt his own friggin boat aaaaarrrrrggggghhhhh!!!!! complete utter poo where are michael myers did go leatherface norman bates these movies makeing our horror fans stupid not it marketing money naive out idiots who am i say could be somebodies american beauty or exorcist anyway , has definatly mastered art sacred push bra lovely clevage dear wish same acting i'd rather watch teen wolf 2 maybe
it's almost embarrasing how bad this horror movie was , because it liked by teenagers and the critics . jennifer love hewitt totally silly unstable in her role rest of cast too tired craweled throughout whole film
an awful movie with as much suspense a cupcake . humor targeted at those the intelligence of four year old horrible acting couldn't sit through it again
this movie did not make sense and it was pointless . i understand the plot
if stephen king was dead , he'd have rolled over in his grave
how can anyone like a movie about killer car ?
horrid and painful remake of the classic 1950's horror flick . not even worth reviewing
lame ! just another boring canister in which to shove a whole bunch of special effects . the original one was infinately better
how could they waste such a good cast on piece of poop movie , as this !
one of the greatest waists talent , money and time ever made . a huge smack to face any contemporary horror fan old hammer films for this has be most god awful remake next night living dead you would better off watching bring it on or an equally horrid film like pearl harbor house haunted hill 1999 is pure sh*t stay away at all costs
that producers of these atrocities know they will make money on sequels is more horrifying than the movies themselves .
other than the original , none of others justify more a 1 .
this one is like an mtv music video , and it not scary at all .
wth...are they kidding? ? stupid sequel , to an even stupider movie . so many unanswered questions who cares! !
i like mindless fun action movies but this movie wasn't fun..it was just minldess and boring . the plot is ridiculous , cgi overused sound so mind numbingly relentless hoping for some truly scary parts none came charcters are flat unintersting dialogue terrible you're great van helsing says dr.jekyl mr.hyde a deranged psycho ...good comeback ending disappointing after finished felt nothing had wasted my money to see bunch of overdone pieces atleast deserve characters that have care about little less rental only...discount
oooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i have yet to see a movie as poorly directed , written and acted (except by jackman) this one . was so looking forward it being big universal monster fan myself supposed be dream come true instead got convoluted plot with mediocre special effects (a stephen sommers tradition) the least believable romanian accents in history of cinema (including that guy at beginning eyes wide shut) should shown every film academy throughout world cautionary example what happens when great idea is given director who way believes he can translate said into screenplay awful awful!!!!!!! !
depp is great , but this film hollow and cold . i was never at one single point afraid it's dragged on about hour too long two thumbs way down
this movie was stupid and had nothing to do with jack the ripper .
b-o-r-i-n-g .
lame rip-off of several much better movies on the same sort subject .
quit possibly the most bran dead and poorly acted horror film i have ever seen . all talent is waisted anyone else sick of crap cgi effects ?
one of the worst movies i've seen this year . pathetic weak story , script dull characters even though rufus sewell is pretty convincing : he was so hateful i wanted to strangle him anyway sfx are ridiculous laughed out loud it isn't scary at all....sometimes little girl quite cool but it's not enough
normally , i tend to get prolific when rate movies but this there is not much say about . it ranks with dreamed of africa and everything else basinger has done besides batman la confidential as absolute garbage the plot ludicris acting was so coarse seemingly unrehearsed effects were terrible had director removed given a tone more like polanski film might have been slightly revived wish could no stars
i saw this movie because everyone told me the opening scene was so awesome . when watched it laughed might have been cool , if weren't cheap and campy looking for that pretty much set mood entire film not only scared through any of found myself laughing most bad script acting baaaaaaaaad special effects
really bad movie ! starts cool (wire slicing) but gets worse and less scary every 10 minutes . i would nt recomend it at all
lame-o-rama .
almost as funny final destination . this is one of those movies that make you think don't people bleed after getting stabbed ?  if you're was a worthless piece crap than i'm proud to say smarter the jack ass made movie
stupid . pointless and unentertaining
given the title , pretty amateurish .
one of the worst horror movies ever made . anybody who gives this above 1 star s being very , overly obscenely generous
the movie starts off right but something goes terribly wrong in middle . cyber-jason ? wtf !
it's time to bury jason once & for all . and this don't resurrect him i'd rather stick my head in a grabage can inhale deeply than sit through another movie like cheesy , cheap pointless we have the usual nearly naked girls some teasing throw with slicing dicing by i know free country but ought consider law banning sequels
when you've run out of so many stupid ideas for sequels that you actually have to take a camp killer into outer space , perhaps it's time end the series .
its just bad.the story is terrible,the acting very weak.the comedy in the movie wasn't even funny . to ppl who created this : plz end yourself
this movie sucks like nothing has ever sucked before.anyone who had anything to do with the making of mess needs apologize all fans real friday 13th films .
laugh out loud funny . just goes to show you that no matter what year it is or far the human race has progressed whenever someone told never turn your back on knife wielding maniac carves hides for a hobby than jack ass going get stabbed from behind
clearly a huge step down from the quality of first and surprisingly unentertaining . while i find most nightmare sequels to be senseless , they are at least entertaining (except for this one)
unfortunatly , all great franchises have one bad movie . jason had part 8 micheal 3 and freddy has 2 the story was actors sucked !
thank god that freddy will never be back .
this movie was absolutely terrible!!! ! people are dying all over the place , and moron is listening to reel tapes of some freak with multiple personalities. . oh gawd.. a waste money dont bother even renting it when hollywood going produce something worth watching i want have crap scared out me see horror not try disect what hell on.. plain boring
this was the stupidest horror movie i have ever seen , it a while ago but can still remember flat out stupidity of !
just plain terrible , even freddy looks old and the new jason should have stayed dead .
a movie was wasted on this useless crossover . where's my star trek vs wars or pokemon meets tokyo pig ? instead , we get gory profanity-filled kill fest not recommended in the slightest
some people say its a classic i didnt enjoy this one bit thought it sucked
good movie for about 5 minutes during the introduction . goes downhill from there saw it free and still feel cheated
finally , something worse than reds  .
this was terrrible not scary or funny freddie sucks azz in movie
yea , this is after freddy became a cartoon of his former scarier self . sequel though introduces the new way takes kids out ! unlike part one - 3 where if you kill someone in dream they die that same real life (tina getting her stomach torn open and thrown all over room) four now killing people do land either have an asthma attack or pass into coma really slack movie characters left from three gofigure
enough stupid halloween movies .
im glad i waited till this one came on hbo to see it...after the ring expected a good movie but it was horrible . so disappointed had couple of "surprise" moments overall story far from unique and ending left me going "huh ? watched for that?" don't recommend at all !
for the so-called scariest movie of year , i was so disappointed . only scary parts were from previews very slow also when a whole theater clears out before credits have begun something is definitely wrong
rip-off of the rocky horror show is neither scary or funny . i would rather watch paint dry than this trash
this is possibly the worst movie ever made and i am ashamed to say that saw whole thing . feel slightly less intelligent after it was finished wow
ah , what a horrible ending to great story .
scream i loved . 2 was okay put this money-grubbing , pointless piece of crap in the back bus with bride chucky  even actors look embarrassed to be movie.. talk about beating a dead horse..
for the first time i honestly didn't know who was going to be murderer . so i'll give 'em that but otherwise.. lines left too many question marks unanswered and you never really got into depth of things could almost tell right away die it wasn't even scary actually laughed when few people killed 'cause if had watched two other movies a pretty good idea what is happen next there some surprising secrets not enough
great minds think alike mr.pink .
oh my god . as if the first sequel wasn't bad enough , they had to make another scream movie. well what can you do right ? a couple of good things though brought randy back(even it was in video) and nice see jay silent bob but that about not keeping with tradition there only one killer who turned out be character whom wich we knew absolutely nothing introduced us once i mean could have been anyone pissed off brother or john q walk-on thing where did everyone get those bullet proof vests?a cute attempt try finish movies sorry guys failed miserably
scream 3 is a total waste of your time . there nothing scary about it , and the ending so confusing doesn't connect with anything that you learned from past 2 in fact changes storyline confuses these silly scripts bad characters weren't introduced to us
was this supposed to be overflowing with suspense ? *looks about* it's certainly something , but it is not .
same ole - . do us a favor and save from scream 4 !
stupid ! a so called horror/thriller film trying to be funny does not go over well . terrible acing from each cast member avoid
this movie sucks ! there was no actual plot , and all the characters seemed fake acting horrible . worst of three whole so bad it painful to watch
lisa bonet's best movie . also her worst a terrible move to begin with yes dear , your breasts are lovely obscurity is that way..
terribly over-hyped movie . by the same group who made super troopers , this just didn't deliver kind of laughs (although to be fair i find that great either though it had its moments) if you were unfortunate enough see house dead think club dread was at least partially making fun given it's supposed cheesy and bad but wasn't so funny moments (i their version pac-man pretty interesting lest) they few far between much a waste eight bucks
ok for a slasher . but how many have there been of them now ? yawn
this movie was way over the top .
where in the hell is original haunting on this list ? they have remake , but not anyone who prefers junk instead of cannot be called a horror film fan . plain and simple
hated it .
its stupid . if your wanna see this , why not rent a couple more movies that suck like the blair witch or maybe ticks
what a piece of garbage!! ! i never thought could hate movie with liam neeson , lili taylor or catherine zeta-jones but can this just sucked house on haunted hill (based the same book as this) was waaaaaayyyyy better . hell others way than crap actually hoping they'd all get killed in end
worst horror film ever made , hands down . when a movie relies only on cgi computer animation for chills it is failure based images are not scary because they transparent and incredibly obviouse that the script sucked true horrorfying moments in this came from sh*t dialouge idea major studio would pump out such garbage has no redeeming quality i will never forgive creators of calling pre packaged cotton candy bull brain dead
not good at all . hella sucked too much computerized graphics story didn't make any sense was gay and the actors couldn't act
horrible movie . there are few movies that flat out bore me or leave really disappointed by the end , but this one did plot ridiculous acting and character development effects stunk
when will film-makers learn that blood and special effects are not scary ! sheesh . this movie was so predictable i could have written it myself....except write better
i was so pissed off when saw this worthless piece of dog crap that nearly kicked my own ass for watching it .
this movie was terrible ! if you haven't seen yet dont bother . will fall asleep during it
what a piece . i couldn't believe how much this film did not live up to its own hype , and the of horror communitites word mouth
i agree with my esteemed henchman , the mad hatter . begining ruled (got blood all over best clown suit) but rest blew hard
the begining was great but it just went down hill real quick . pointless plot , murder for kicks slow-mo scene of cop on his knees being executed drawn out and completly moronic rob.. stick to music
one of the worst horror movies ever made . filled with cliches , unoriginality a terrible script plot and horrible camera work rob has lot to learn.....
a painful experience . so bad , i asked for my money back on this one why ? just look at the title : 1000 corpses and there were only 937!!! ! where are little ticket man??? do you want to feel mental anguish??? order give me double or will have blooooooodd!!!
absolute nonsense . a substandard ripoff of the texas chainsaw massacre
the worst one of entire series !
unfortunately , jason didn't go to hell and this far gone series is still churning out senseless sequels .
the final friday is an atrocity . jason hardly in it , and whole only a vorhees can kill plot stupid mama was killed by outsider saving graces are tony wonder llama cameo of freddy's glove roll on freddy vs !
this is the absolute worst of series plain sucked
what was sean cunningham thinking when he created this sh*t?? ? completly destroyed one of the coolest killers in cinematic history . jason isn't killing people , it is a nasty little demon critter what!!???!! ! so after all these years i like idea fbi going but they did very cheap and unappealing manner love series film does man no justice ever now we can do pray that x will kick movie ass
ok , jason . fine do you still want to kill people because if were a normal killer would have retired already and left us alone even thr first one wasn't really that good anyways
is this over yet ? i thought the first one , maybe two were interesting . was more interested to find out where jason came from but please..haven't we had enough of stupid trollops hanging around in bras and panties a cabin saying what's that noise 'i have great idea will put rain coat my scivvies go trapsing pitch black campground with flashlight has no batteries follow sound someone screaming being bludgeoned.' these movies frustrate me than anything myself you dumb naked tramp don't into abandaned outhouse freakin' see six by foot pool blood are standing your boyfriend's head on stick front you? !
with all the hoopla about this film , i determined to watch it . i'd heard that some viewers in theater were so frightened they would vomit etc well now see why vomiting but surely wasn't from fright had come one of two sources : (1) bad popcorn or candy etc. (2) awful stench emanating terrible flick !
this was a sorry excuse for horror movie . they tried to build up the suspense in it , but failed miserably i frankly couldn't care less what happened characters fact throughout found myself wishing that each of them died horrible very torturous death will admit camera angle last scene cool shot however 10 seconds about only redeeming thing
not very scary . blair witch was boring and somewhat pointless to mention , cheaply made though that wouldn't necessarily have detract from the element of horror this one just didn't do much for a lot us
like many of the raters here , i concur that this movie was one sorriest ever put out . it hyped over al gore-invented internet and led to some fake buzz never scared during ; instead got madder as sat through crap wondered how took on such bulls***it ? worthless piece junk shouldn't be classified horror i've seen home movies with more terror than my first hair-cut camera beat thank goodness now everyone knows & it's crappy sequel are pure !
insert sound of gagging here .
everyone thinks this movie was based on a true story . trouble is , it wasn't there no real blair witch legend in burkittsville maryland local named elly kedward either she actually just young irish immigrant who even from that area ! eileen treacle did not drown tappy east creek her mother murdered 1864 does exist black hills forest there's 'coffin rock' sadly fake as they come
i was pretty disappointed to learn that the whole thing had been improvised . swearing wasn't a problem because they were actors doing improv (making it up as go) and that's what most young people do when are angry , upset or frustrated
out of curiosity , my mother and i rented this movie but never expected it to be so bad ! the directing purposely amateurish is supposed invoke creepiness makes scooby-doo look truly scary in comparison . there way too much senseless profanity i've heard any group teenagers curse plot extremely unclear like floor-faced fools only good thing about was that able enjoy brilliantly executed g-rated parody by cartoon network scooby doo project
this is definately one of the worst horror movies ever made...and budget movie isn't only thing to blame for it either . bad acting , script scenery hated  ! will literally make you vomit if are a car sick type individual
the whole movie gave me a complete headache.the was so ultra-boring and ending like wtf .
i am thinking of taking my camcorder and recording the friday night drunken brawls , over at our local bar . least movie would make more sense firmly beleive that this was start all reality shows we now see on tv...bleeech.
just plain boring!!!! !
i am disappointed at this movie . it's not scary all!! ! the plot is week and ford's acting a joke (as usual) pfeiffer did well tho still , worth watchin
they had a good concept , to use actors who didn't have scripts (anyone see this as prelude all the reality tv crap that's overrunning airwaves now?) with handheld cameras . jerkiness of picture was irritating though admittedly necessary for type thing were going but about credit i can give it waiting be scared almost fell asleep through (it's extremely slow-going) and got left sitting down theater lights came up wondered  well ? when's something happen might worth seeing check out concepts in making film otherwise better pick else watch
it sucked . save yourself the trouble , dont bother to see
what a disappointment . not scary in the least camerawork didn't bother me , but girl film sure did i kept wishing blair witch would come out and get her so she shut hell up nagging woman is something that can't stand
what the hell were they thinking???? ? this movie totally sucks ! watching my cat crap tripples fun of bull
it made me nauseous and nothing ever happened . was horrible
this movie kept me on the edge of my seat... . waiting for something to happen it never did dialog consisted mostly f word , used once every 10.44 seconds i learned that even could be offended by language when exposed long enough basically if you take 11 out center and put in a continuous play loop you've got whole thing stupid about 3 people who go into woods with map they can't read compass don't know how use have no survival skills whatsoever any ordinary person threatened 'whatever-it-was' would hopefully sharpen couple branches make spear or dagger fashion some kind weapon what's up all filming while they're 'running their lives' ? mean pick lack realism because is fiction but these were so moronic was actually cheering get them couldn't eventually reproduce understand what trying accomplish ; fear unknown missed mark mile worked didn't boring repetitive had consisting almost entirely f--- left burning desire call congressman demand more funding education hope $30,000 cost spent expensive lunches otherwise wasted
this is the worst scary movie i have ever seen . it was way over-hyped , with reports that grown men were leaving theaters heart attacks and you couldn't sleep without a light on for weeks...well these stories had to be fake because one of most boring movies too much talking angry screaming...not mention over-use f-word ...i mean cussing okay some extent but when hear used every other word in gets tiresome whole witch thing seemed very unrealistic buy idea following group events happened more like work local pranksters which made un-scary ending terrible confusing left me feeling unsatisfaction stupid camera movement makes really sick your stomach gave headache after while don't waste time movie...it's not worth money hour half life takes watch
my advice - do not rent , buy or even waste your time watching this thing with friends . unless of course you're in the mood to make fun something that will barely challenge skills sarcasm it is by far most inane but successful celluloid i have ever had displeasure witnessing as much hate admit bought a $6.00 bargain copy suckered own curiosity and cagey promotional stunt seen on sci-fi channel sci-fi's documentary  while very shrewd effective was still basically big fat lie more cleverly done coherently put together than actual film completely agree molfan 90 minutes life you never get back
this movie was a rip off ! the only thing that i will say good in ending . other than it gave me headache
it is almost impossible to watch a movie objectively . the viewer brings with him/her , consciously or not expectations and personal feelings which absolutely apply what he/she watching this as should be film i love others may hate think one of worst ever made lot other people enjoy i'll give you an example : blair witch project ! enjoyed see how works ? too heard hype couldn't wait actually first two times tried was sold out finally had go afternoon matinee after saw more confused than annoyed scary  terrifying so on seen different cut maybe fell asleep without knowing missed stuff went again then once home video months later just make sure nope still me anyway it's simple idea would seem have potential 3 young student filmmakers burkettsville maryland formerly (this fact but fiction invented by makers though itself real)called documentary settler in colonial name elly kedward who supposedly practiced witchcraft being exiled from settlement die woods she apparently caused plague wipe most children hundreds years believed some roaming causing mayhem horror aplenty including inducing crazy hermit lived 1940's kidnap kill them his basement they interviewed various locals set off into became lost were victimized at night strange sounds someone something that little piles stones outside their tent disappeared remaining old hermit's abandoned house dropped cameras themselves footage found several pasted together we are all well good even has creepy obviously about frightening am say my own opinion stop anyone checking if interested thought whole thing played flatly three non-actors playing students irritating bicker scream swear throughout no variation theme despite implications rocks each morning stick figures hanging trees did personally find these things threatening jerks hot putting there why turn lights stay awake noises nebulous best gone camping will tell full sorts breaking sticks limbs falling moving around cries sometimes sound human won't complain jerkiness camerawork because fair supposed raw shot walking through filming comment stupidity notion extremity terror ...alone hunted.. girl funny knit cap famously intones her nose running camera kids moronic keep authentic experience borefest like us dorks started until either way keeled over last ten minutes when wonks murderous inside certain amount tension considered entirely could potentially happen rather anything does big problem represents hour half take opportunities curiosity-since dimbulbs shooting every waking moment while day period only going bathroom wouldn't schmucks show limited wit taking opportunity sneak up another during private moments interesting least for
i didn't understand the hype surrounding this movie . found it to be very tasteless , and nauseating from camera movement
this was not a scary movie . there no plot kids running around the woods is big climax at end let down audience never even got to see blair witch plus , made me physically sick from shaky camera
to me , it was a stupid movie . has have action and drama most of the time camera on trees or ground
i hate this movie . can someone say boring ? is the most ever watched got a fat headache from camera's movements talk about waste of seven bucks
from the previews it seemed pretty good , but when i saw thought was terrible and fake . sitting down waiting for something to happen at very end going didn't hated
it wasn't even scary , nothing in the movie to me would classify as a horror . best part of sucked and that was supposed be scene
this movie hella sucked . i thought it was going to be scary , but wasn't maybe expected too much out of made me dizzy
i thought it was awful . don't understand what everyone going all crazy for really stupid , and a waste of time money there's nothing to be scared about wasn't even little bit frightening
i rated this movie a 1 because it looked so fixed and fake ! i'd have to admit that some parts freaked me out , but as read magazines stuff made look .
it was a waste of time and money . i got dizzy
did not understand the movie . was very boring and enough excitement when it got to end , good part ended
horrible!!! ! nice waste of film . thank god i did not see this a the show if you buy dvd player should get movie for free rates 10 on gay meter
this is not a horror film , it's horrible . thoughtful review of picture virtually impossible .. but here goes the characters are annoying and become only more so as you watch them through lense camera that damn wobbly can hardly walk straight at end
this was the worst movie ever made! ! it a waste of money and hype . whole idea not giving actors script is ridiculous if there no , then how can any story be told in my opinion time $7.00
i didn't like this movie because of the bluriness camera that hurt my eyes when watched it on big screen . gave me a headache asked for return
worst movie ever
the blair witch project has got to be without doubt greatest waste of an 90 minutes or so my life . complete tripe!! !
.. . and i still know its terrible
...and i still don't care.. . die already..
why oh did they make this movie ?
christ all mighty ! what a peice of cow dung!!! if the original ikwydls was not enough to send you home rushing vomit bag , then this should do trick . there is no reason see movie it boring and totally unbelievable.this picture even holds itself above audience by believing that we don't know capial africa ? are morons intelligent film goers have any self respect stay far away from wet fart
man.. . i have never been so let down by a movie considering , that wanted to love this move.. since the original exorcist is my favorite horror flick of all time almost gave 2 stars because it did make me laugh in certain supposed scary parts before commented on tried think ways at least.. least just couldn't do was horrible boring dragged out piece garbage
thank god freddie is dead ! now we have to look forward jason vs . yeeee haawwww!!
we could only wish
pure crap !
let's get real , folks : this may be a trendy cult favorite but as strictly horror movie it sucks . bad
are you kidding me ? the effects and acting were so lame i almost took razors to my wrists ! this movie is moronic dull say least .
just awfal this is the same director as urban legends yes was not great but it fun and entertaing movie really stupid only good scene when sexy girl in a bikini gets killed hot tub i would have never guesse killer going to do ather than that sucks waste youre time watch halloween friday 13th nightmare on elm street scream know what you did last summer or
i hate to keep using sucks describe movies , but as long they churning out this crap i'll use the term . can't believe angel lowered himself star in hopeless garbage did really think that guys would watch just because threw denise richards along with a bevvy of other good-looking girls ? tell me we're not shallow
there are vacation home movies out that scarier than this film . roses red , violets blue skunk cabbage stinks and so do you
boring and predictable . anyone could have figured out the entire plot in first ten minutes a stupid waste of $7.50 too bad , though this been great writing acting doomed one
correct me if i am wrong , but in most horror movies isn't it the general consensus that we want protagonist(s) to get away from evil killer ? think is only respect which valentine differs stupid movie fare . you actually these horrid actors die even though deaths were really disapointing suppose idea itself meritorus just came out be a jumbling mixture of over and under acting at-times confusing plotline not mention pathetic murderer invoke within viewer sense tense watchfulness who will next how they one sits there caring dies (except for when it's funny like crazy guy by iron) all (big surprise) have say do recommend this well scared at any rate laugh expense crappy film then means
welcome ! to horror movie hell . hehe i don't have three days spend listing the flaws of this so will just brush over top first it is by guy who did equally terrible urban legend his visual styling cute and all but can't save these poo scripts characters are inept unlikeable you honestly want them die horrible deaths start out good then as if were a kiddie film turn into sell leave with dull boring unimaginitive like when certain big breasted bimbo gets trepped in hot tub sheet ao hard reenfirced plastic killer drilling down at her gives up after 15 seconds tosses drill , electocuting whoopdy doo haven't seen that before not even haveing beautiful work deftones on soundtrack can help peice o trash flick ending last death really quit funny go see bored disapointment would hide body bag ? began stabbing contense every room stay perfectly still or run for said some stoopid ass kids
this 'nightmare' should have never even made it to theatres...it was completely horrific and not in a good horror movie way.. .
freddy go away , come back to hollywood another day . with movies so stupid boring and silly i always thought that your series was a pity you are mental crazy wild now we have through the tourchure of seeing child ?
i actually saw them film part of this movie in boonton , nj 1983 . not that predisposed me toward liking it ; thought the finished product was a horrible piece garbage i'm all for encouraging making low-budget movies especially horror but there needs to be requisite amount talent and imagination involved formation said or why waste everybody's time ? even entertaining so-bad-it's-good sort way if you're hard-core masochist search punishment go see an ed wood instead tripe..
this movie sucked-its neither a horror or comedy !
i saw this movie and tried to claw out my own eyes . theres no god because he wouldn't let kind of happen
this is probably the second worst movie i've seen in a long time . i watched it with two other people and they both thought same storyline bad , simple-minded unexploited characters were weak supporting actresses/actors action/fighting scenes weren't very good either but that's not even part dialogue was literally laughable (the sort you would expect from story-lined action ten years ago) here's one example : let's just kick some ass ! it's what we do best background music dis-tasteful imagine theme game quake 2 except much worse recommend saving your money going to see one.. if anything wait until comes out on video
sucked
oh god,plz end the series right now.they only had a few good sequels to series.this one is of worst.horrible,and i mean horrible acting by lead character at end.i was actually laughing her slipping on mud and pretending cry.the ending so bad stupid.,the deaths are still same which getting kinda tiresome now.reggie annoying plastic spider doofus.plz don't see this movie.its terrible !
1 cuz the tommy guy was hot . otherwise id give it a 0 !
without hesitation , the very worst of all film fridays . acting is particularly horrible as plot ending not surprising at and viewer doesn't care for one second about any characters only thing it's got going it gratuitous nudity which more present in this than other friday
junk . this movie was just dumb i dont even think it by the same directer acting horrible
sorry to say this but the first one was way better , never should been made in place .
stupid . illogical a dracula that at one point can't be killed by the sunlight but then later he can ? very predictable gerard butler was nice to look , that's about it movie's credit did base around little know judeo-christian theory of dracula's origin and explains several things associated with (stake through heart silver etc) however wasn't scary or suspensful actually in new orleans please is no wonder most actors this film havent' worked since disaster
in general this movie is very boring and quite predictable . additionally , i will be forever bothered by the fact that science fiction/ fantasy community cannot arrive at a consensus as to whether or not silver kills vampire like movies one was just bad surprised omar epps christopher plummer actually made honestly felt cheated after comment on plot character development because there simply none
pure crap .
i used to be able say know what you did last summer was the worst horror movie ever . at least it tried develope characters , interesting original this film misses every beat and fails even being a worth pissing on if anything laughed myself silly whenever dracula himself showed up he reminded me of neo from matric does actor have over under act ? there is no middle ground acting wise in only succeeding taking my money now am messanger taste for unintintionaly funny movies go want good hunk rent shinning
this movie sucked ! i don't recommend it at all . first of , is sooo fake...i mean stuff soo unreal its not funny yea there are times where you will jump or be scared but i'd hardly call a horror more like wierd
this was ok the first 529 times i watched it , but after that got kinda boring . anyway now am grown up prefer more serious movies like hellraiser iii
this movie turned me off in the first 10 minutes . was grotesque and stupid , story well there no really if you like meaningless gore watch til your hearts content otherwise avoid disease it is about
honestly , the movie was more boring than scary .
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . there's nothing more here than a lot violence and no story 2003
this is by far the worst movie i have seen so in 2003 ! would walked out of one had my date not asked me to stay . mean honestly people , do waste your time previews look really good but it nothing like them  depressing and downright gross
whis is the most stupidest movie ever things are so fake freddy krueger oew makes me want to hurl movies nasty and terrible who could watch such a devil
what lies beneath was a terrible movie which attempted to be scary but failed miserably . the blatantly foreshadowed everything that going happen , insulting audience used classic techniques gave away
pure crap !
i think this is beyond all bounds the worst of child play franchise . only frightning moments in peice were parts that had people trying to act and horrible dialogue spoken low production costs crap idea make one child's movies horror films ever made complete poo
unimaginative , senseless garbage .
over complicated plot , bad script and dreadful sfx . ottman must have been on dope to direct this thing
this was so bad i cheering the guy on . horrible acting does not live up to original
you may not find this review helpful , but all i can say is film was the biggest insult to a lover ever . it shouldn't have been since most contrived slasher movie seen still its stupidity makes feel good about yourself and bad hollywood human race
okay i love horror movies but this movie was really bad . how many times can a repeat the whole scream killer sequence every has to have long reason on they kill none of it makes sense now is great movie! ! urban legend alright what hell were thinking making sequel wanna laugh in face director because so only person who saves kid that me , myself and irene effects maker oh before forget pam grier woman cop you! an insult all fans movie-goers
what a waste . i have seen some terrible horror films in my day but for thr the love of pete ! this has got to worst film years and that is saying alot not only casting crap throw back alfred hitchcock at end made me want choke maker them think movie could even be comparable masterpeice beyond deplorable joke fans watch it prepared boring evening
the first one was terrible...why in god's name did they bother to do a sequel???? ?
oh my god ! they should of called it friday the 13th part 8 jason goes down with ship does not take manhattan muppets did a better job in but this is worst sequel i mean what hell was that makeup on so hokey and why talk turn into little kid new title
i have an idea for a part ix : jason comes on to the set filming latest abomination , and kills off everyone starting with director producer ending actors as they're putting makeup .
jason takes manhatten is just a very bad movie . why you ask ? well,first the really doesn't take place in it on boat and than there at last 15 mins of -8 sewers then,the deaths.the death scenes were weak.there's coal/rock death,gkass slashing,and boxing being one goofiest deaths ever.than last,there's awful acting.horrible,like most f13 movies but this,they don't even attempt to act,even lead character.and that ugly little kid haunts girl actually scary geez this terrible.do not watch movie,i warned
unquestionably the worst sequel out of entire series (with possible exception jason x) . acting was horrible , plot idiotic and music stupid this movie really had some potential as i happy to see it take place somewhere other than camp itself beginning ok but end so makes me wonder how filmmakers could ever live with themselves
i hated it . sucked dick really liked when they had sex a lot of the crazy stuff
what can i say , this is at the top of my worst sequels list right next to urban legends final cut still know you did last summer and halloween 3 . ok its jason takes manhattan yet entire movie place on a cruise ship exept end when they drift ashore manhatton 20 min in it was cute black guy got his head blocked off but honestly if couple punks were giving sh*t would really just show them face ? travesty friday 13th series besides looks so decayed that stiff breeze take him out sucks !
weak and stupid . worst horror sequel next to halloween 3 this film sucks
i hate jason movies . way too sick who wants to see an idiot killing teenagers ?
terrible doesn't describe how bad this movie is!!!!!!!!! ! one of the worst i've seen
the first two movies ruled but then third one crapped on them . how could son of a jackel be taken down by some dizzy girl with letter opener
what the f*** was carpenter thinking when he spun series in this direction . didn't just change with turd , totally derailed franchise worst horror movie ever
this movie was the worst ever!! ! it shouldn't really even be included in halloween michael myers series . didn't make any sense what so ever
this was the worse of series . no micheal myers what so ever and has nothing to do with
the worst movie of all time !
a true horror movie that made me sick to my stomach . it wasn't because of blood and gore , was the whole thing about killing children on halloween is just sick..
when i watched this so called halloween ilm was thinking to my self where in the name of god is michael myeres movie had a verry stupid plot it an irish maniac wants kill kids mean come you are way better watching first two then really crap that soooooooo anoying .
this one doesn't have a thing to do with michael myers , and it sucks . but suck because he's not in ! i mean it's really bad scary just plain the people who made film must had some serious issues children didn't scare me at all left feeling
it was a terrible movie .
i hated this movie it was so boring horrible had nothing to do with michael myers not rent
not scary , just disgusting .
what the hell were they thinking?? ? i saw this movie assuming would get to see myers in action.instead a stupid about halloween masks and most annoying count down ever !
horrible .
aaaahhhhhhh , the most overrated movie of year it wasnt scary at all this is a spoiler but i dont care there are no mosnters in forrest village elders dressing up so freaking stupid they wildlife refuge outside modern day philadelphia see just ruined for you anyways and hopefully saved money!!! !
a cheap attempt at urban legends,scream or i know clone.this movie was rented as free rental and the clerk refunded my money for tape paid ! this should tell you all need to .
terrible one of the worst
another movie on the sequel craze .
pathetic
wretched . makes the first three films look like classical masterpieces
cheesy sequel that offers nothing . why do they make sequels are so terrible ruin an entire seres ?
giving this movie one star makes the other movies look bad . possibly worst horror ever made terrible awful pathetic pick your own synonyms
i think this movie was very stupid . the writers got carried away as if 1st and second weren't bad enough they had to add a 3rd now is really considered horror or what ? i'd call it joke made me shake my head instead of grabbing seat how about part not needing condom because it's all rubber baby dumb
this movie sucked ! that's all i can say . it was a funny idea in the 80's , but now it's just redundant didn't see one good thing terrible script directing and acting hated
one of the worst movies ever made why did dolls have sex that was just plain stupid and this movie wasnt even scary
good lord , help us all . the first movie should not have been made therefore sequel was extremely unnecessary and third one against law i believe it a dreary sunday afternoon that my husband channel surfing stopped on this ridiculous yes watched it..i needed brain dead day fit bill do need to see buddy dolls doing deed (very odd scene) overall is worst ever
this movie is a sequel that didn't have to be made . the stupid antics of chucky weren't enough time now has kill woman and put her in body another doll so we barbie ken going on murdering rampage does nothing
this movie is terrible . it's not scary , or funny all of the chucky movies are retarded but definitely worst i wanted my five dollars back from theatre because sucked it had no plot
this movie was very stupid . i did not understand it they had dolls having sex , and just a plain terrible
you put a rapper in movie the is going to suck
this movie sucked big monkey nuts . i snuck into the and demanded a refund fell alseep half way thru only to be awoken by guy in front of me who started snore man was most painful thing i've had go that says alot because been shot paintball gun
this movie sucked on so many levels . but if you happen to enjoy bad films and like wasting your life hours at a time then you'll love bones 
oh snoop dogg . you are no whitney houston you're not even the spice girls just one horrid actor bones is basically same exact film as blacula  , but instead it has a rap soundtrack and set today horrible in title role his female co-stars provide nothing eeek
i hate saying it , but not even snoop dogg and is great personality could save this sad sorry tired piece of trash . so fast paced it's rushed poorly written reads like a dick jane book characters thin they are translucent blood orange looks buffalo wing sauce you cannot help feel for any character in film run the cheese mill fun to watch gave much better performance recent training day which showcased more talented side just having with little he givin jimmy bones comes back seeking vengence against those who betrayed him years past kills them all fifteen maybe twenty minutes no build up suspence one cares then wants continue lovin his girl played by pam grier start relationship daughter never had chance meet because got killed lame as hell plain bad should crawl be put grave poor ol
one of the stupidest and least scary horror movies i've ever seen . it was almost as bad at battlefield earth
i came out of the theatre crying that wanted those wasted minutes my life back .
 . i don't even know where to begin it was so bad that if they make a sequel , i'll protest this is the absolute worst movie i've ever seen (to be fair haven't gigli ) liked video game gave chance there were many things wrong with can 1) automatically assume bunch of teenagers who have never touched gun in their life become expert at use semi automatic weapons and able handle recoil upon picking one up 2) gratuitous breast exposure should least limited less than 3 times ten-minute span unless it's pornographic film 3) why 15th-century captain's log typed bound leather ? or did captain just really good handwriting write new roman 12 point 4) course all asian girls martial arts love america they'd wear tacky outfit us flag do time seriously what thinking that's beginning my rant can't believe someone had first conceive idea then think find else thought person walked out theater made perfect comment : trying fall asleep
turds on a stick stink less than this movie and have more substance...and corn .
crapdotcom would have been a title more fitting .
rip off
i made an honest effort to enjoy it , but in the end had no idea what hell whole point of film was . i'm still trying make sense
www.fear.com/sucksbigmonkeynuts.html
when i first tried to rent this , the guy at video store snatched it away from me and said i'm sorry just can't let you leave with movie it's that bad . now know why isn't worst i've ever seen but not far behind either like a really crappy rehash of ringu (japanese film 1998 ; american remake ring  came out in 2002 same year as feardotcom ) basic idea if watch will die x amount days did reasoning (a tortured soul wanting revenge) didn't make for strong story true antagonist's motives were never explained (he kind liked torturing women fun guess) excessive nudity violence some which is highly disturbing seemed there only shock value nothing more your local rental cares he won't
terrible movie , this aint horror it's retarded .
this was probably the very worst movie i ever saw .
after getting stung on the first one , why would you ever view second ? well i was a sucker and watched it . ouch !
the worst sequel i have ever seen . (that includes caddyshack 2)
you said it genghis ; fool me once shame on - twice . but , if did shell out actual cash to see this please email i have really cool white plastic 8 track player with car lighter adapter that i'll be happy sell
like part one wasn't bad enough . this was a waste of film and paper
the only scary thing about film is fact that it was made in first place .
i haven't seen part ii of the blair witch project but i'm going to predict that it's just as lousy first one . like others this gem needs be removed from horror category
bad movie with characters . i guess they were tired the angry black man character and decided to go wiccan there was no blair witch it brain dead tourists that killed those people for some reason they're all too dumb remember anything don't think of as having ending ruined two hours your life saved
wow really dissapointed :(
why make a 2 when one wasn't that good .plot was bad waste of time and money
i would like to share my opinion....i bought the first bw video before renting an saw it because brother age 19 at time said was good scared him death well be honest hated , so furious about how bad sucked in all life ive never seen a movie more worse then that.....so im extremely reluctant even seeing second one yet just earlier last year did little research not sure til have proof back this up but could very that wasnt real film documentary suppose realistic fake.....once actual of ill with you all.....after get online write anyone regarding expressed complete regretfulness for buying horrible felt was... .
there's no reason to even comment on this movie . it is horrible you are making a huge mistake if go see
atually,i'm a big fan of tbwp...after watched the first tbwp,i always try to find conclusion.i think all you,want it too.is that right?suddenly , when i heard news 'bout next blair witch(bw 2),my heart start pushing me buy movie....but finally,after watching bw 2....i felt regret.. . is because movie sick...suck.it just wasted my money before buying movie..i will at rustun parr's house but not.i would like suggest continue from rustin and make conclusion(whatever it's true or not).keep up good work...
i recenty went to see blair witch 2  . it was so stupid liked the first one but this totaly sucked begining really good only like five minuets hated and would not recomend anyone
i recently made a huge mistake . went to see blair witch 2 saw the first one and it was pretty good , so figured might as well go sequel horrible characters were weak there no plot motive anything i've never fallen asleep during horror movie before but this time found myself struggling stay awake absolutely sense words simply cannot express how bad waste of $7.00 would'nt mind if people behind did else ever again you thought ending wait until can't beleive actually waisted my money on that garbage movies like discourage me from going been more pissed off at than i'm just stop talking about get angry sucks ! beg others out can give some reviews would be nice know other also recognize when they them don't end up thinking crazy
this movie is horrible . a about dumb cheerleaders being killed enough said! !
this movie sucked big time . it was overrated and critics hyped up too much wasn't scary at all i able to predict the supposed parts
a bunch of cheerleaders get massacred . who the f**k pays money to watch this s**t ?
one word , bad . imagine gremlins but not scary or funny in the least
this is a remake of the texas chainsaw masscre shame on you renne zellweger for showing up first day shooting
with a great cast who would have thought this movie could be soooo bad !
masturbate
mad me wish i had a gun or poison something .
no offense.. . but i thought this was really stupid the whole plot pretty pathetic , and acting wasn't good either see it has lots of reviews. just can't believe that correct me if i'm wrong--this is one where a girl goes back in time to find dinosaur egg or something like ? bad
you're kidding me right ?
they suck , and mic's got a big mouth . great for cock sucking....
this is nothing more than a made for tv cheapie with 2 big stars . truly bad movie and soooooo predictable i want my money back !! !
this was the lamest imax movie i have every seen . it is in 3d , so you must wear these big glasses on your head that hundreds of people before sweated
worst sporting event ever ! i was told that a nascar the place to see hot tail , sadly mistaken . women looked like what expected them look and whats up with confederate flag ? tried watch it because heard so exciting but feel asleep on lap 20 think enjoy you need be intoxcicated felt these drivers were trying hard act tough guys hey buttholes stop wasting our precious fuel calling yourselves athletes if they're everyone who drives car truck or bus is an athlete when last time at driver thought this guy michael jordan of driving never plus goes off causes me miss my favorite show simpsons just want race daddy
i was expecting lots of high quality imax racing action . very little behind the scenes stuff could have seen on tv disappointed
what was the imax thinking ?
n'sync are nothin' but puppets . anyone who likes this is probably an assclown
yuck . they suck and what's with the title copying bsb's larger than life  ? do ever anything original??
a very bad score .
i hated west side story . it was so boring and mindless the acting terrible , there like not one single thing that liked about this movie !
a truly bad movie-with one of the most annoying soundtracks ever.once on job,the only music playing was this soundtrack over and over-when i finally spoke up offered to get another tape out my car loudly cheered by everyone in building.people were literally ready walk off job !
i worked at a grocery store with video rental shop . the lady that there always played this movie , over and again hated it can not stand
why this piece of cinimatic pablum ever became a hit is beyond me . the story line boring and john travolta olivia newton-john waddle through script i have only seen it once or twioce , that was twice to many !
please , hand me the air-sickness bag . a stupid turd of nostalgia featuring two absolutely worst leads ever to disgrace screen olivia newton-john sure looks good in this one but as usual sings like she's got clothespin on her nose john ravolta puts another oily and unconvincing gooch performance singing frog rut twitching around that disconcerting manner his songs are juvenile claptrap dancing is predictable hardly memorable script moronic otherwise great flick!! !
hate it so much . i don't know why people like awful.
grease is such an overrated movie . it's absolutely horrible and john travolta lame
i hte werewolves and hate salt vineger pringles . once pop just cant stop puking this movie was stupid alls im saying is if you really wanted to blow people crap it wouldnt be as difficult they make seem uuuh rahhhh anarchist cookbook
the sound of mucus is more like it . who world finds julie andrews at all appealling or entertaining ? gadzooks , she's one worst : i feel i'm going to fall into a diabetic coma everytime she comes frame christopher plumber truly gifted actor who's been gravely overlooked for decades puts in fine performance guy hardly song and dance type yet he doesn't actually sing much this flick children are obnoxious story those typical hollywood based on true feel-good bowel movements there few decent songs score but most your usual musical filler was such popular when first came out looking today it's hard determine why course bland easily digestible family fare please so hokey goody-goody that you just want barf
i actually had to get drunk enjot this movie . everyone should try that!it is definately funny that way it was boring and bland
this has got to be one of the worst watses 2 hours i have ever spent . not only was movie boring its songs live on forever they are scourge mankind absolute just seemed way too phony
just amplified my belief that keanu reeves is the worst . actor ever
although the movie is nearly devoid of objectionable content (aside from occasional profanity) , there are two things that absolutely destroy . first songs extremely grating and annoying second sexism in this production outrageous no more obvious than shockingly-inappropirate ending completely different short story pygmmalion 1964 based on i just can't recommend
when will these sugary old-farty musicals end ? please ! this movie is way too cheesy for my tastes . the singing made me ears hemmorhage bing crosby a terrible singer and not good to look at overall , musical as fun anencephaly
terrible , movie . why ? the acting is worst i have seen of any ever plot makes it even worse who wants to watch a where around bus all day
i love musicals but simply didn't enjoy this one at all . a big disappointment
very undeserving of all the acclaim .
my wife and i thought the movie was so bad boring , we walked out got our money back . then what happens ? it wins big at acadamy awards ! couldn't get over maybe were crazy don't know but stand by original opinion i'll rent give another try
there must have been some sort of mass hysteria in hollywood when the powers that be annointed this dog as a great movie . it isn't even good thank god i saw on video and not theater or would walked out crashing bore
long , drawn out and sleep inducing . one of worst wastes money i have ever seen the plot was predictable boring couldn't wait to get theater even though it over 100 degrees outside !
oh my god . this piece of crud was the most overhyped and overated thing i ever seen renee zellwegger needs to leave singing business music score terrible catherine zeta jones can not dance or sing at all she stick speaking roles as for queen latifah , well in her role but she's only good that happened movie seriously none characters are likable roxie heart is pretty a donkey's vas deferens talented screeching bat
what a lovely message to send kids . kill people and get famous oh , how wonderful ! yes little susie vinny jamal let's all go out have sex with for fame then shoot them btw i'm being sarcastic
f*ck musicals !
people think that because they take a cow ( renee z) and stuff her in dress teach to dance , have an instant hit way overated
whats so great about this movie it sucks
sensless movie , bad acting direction horrible script just good special effects.good for airheads .
i have never liked this movie , and wish it wuld just go away . john ravolta (no that is not a typo!) the most annoying actor of all time he can't act dance how considered classic beyond me !
life is too short to watch this horrorshow .
oh enough already ! this isn't 1977 anymore . after reading naturallyyou's review i felt like was in a disco hell time warp give me break... you should be dancing  , jive talkin ... man please stereo types and abusing women fever the producer had making film for gutter
i love john travolta but this movie was a wasted hour of my time . it had great music no story
speed was the worst action/thriller movie i have ever witnessed . plot shallow and acting horrendous after viewing this , wish could gotten my money back it shouldn't be sold that as well ii
it's no wonder why sandra bullock has disappeared from the movie screen a bit . film that made her star was worst of its year in bus manipulated by terroist , who for some reason finds it necessary to put bomb on so if reaches over (or over?) 50 mph will explode great all we need is another cheesy-ass wanna be adventure with keanu reeves
ludicrously overrated . jarring , jangling and incoherent none of the music is even original !
hated this movie!!! ! the biggest waste of my time .
words cannot describe how awful i thought this movie was . it wasn't the acting , which good use of modern music in that era just didn't work for me when like a virgin came on watched rest with everyone else but point no return they could have had wonderful without stupid doesn't fit maybe i'm too much history buff couldn't stand
i am sorry but laughed at this one . just too stupid to buy the plot...there is no suspension of belief ...this movie doesn't sell it ;-(
i hate this movie it is the worst thing to every hit screen would rather have my toe nails ripped out one by than see that . swear god if had power abolish from time constrants be honest midevil torture mor pleassurefull dam
this was the dumbest movie i have ever seen
it's amazing this insignificant , low-budget piece of crap garnered the following it did seeing that one worst films ever puked out by hollywood . starring unctuous p swayze a clubfooted hoofer in need acting lessions and pinchfaced little trollop jennifer grey nice body honker all best thing about turkey is fact takes place borscht belt oy vey which harkens back to childhood memories my long-distant past even dancing supposed strong suit attempt at making movie was predictable hardly impressive what would have made better if fifteen nude scenes : kept me from nodding off every five minutes or so cousin brucie morrow's favorite flick tells you plenty
i dislike dancing in general . think if people want to go humiliate themselves , on ahead and do it ! the music isn't my style either
bad acting , stupid story horrendous music . i hated this movie in 1988 when my girlfriend dragged me to it and hate even more now ted turner insists on showing 30 times a week cable
this movie sucked , and the music . gist of wall is we should all feel sorry for rock star because he's tired rat race his dad died in world war ii there are about a million other folks who plenty people have lost their dads they don't go out make abysmal pulp like irishgit's assertion that would be fine high school junior's film project dead on
annoying garbage . would be just fine if this was a grade 11 film student's effort for professionals , appalling
one of few movies that is actually worse than pulp fiction . this movie not only boring , but it about as close to a bad lsd trip i ever want come seriously awful....be warned..
the movie was terribly inaccurate in it's potrayal of jim . he had a very sweet , shy side which made him irristable to every one who knew him.i'm saddened that this generation is getting such horrible depiction
if that guy was on my roof singing and dancing i would throw a chair at him
a stupid , inconsequential musical based on the life of totally unimportant dictator's wife who was also in her own right . useless premise supported by typically wan banal and limp score concocted that dreadful a.l webber composer some worst crap ever heard humankind add most overrated no-talent since bing crosby/bob hope namely madonna can't sing dance or act (a triple threat) wooden sleazy-looking antonio banderas you have workings feature film whose entire contents should been left cutting room floor friend mine rented this video for small social gathering we laughed at how atrociously bad cultural afterbirth bankrolls like ? better yet actually coughs up $$$ to go see theatre
madonna was too old to play eva peron . no wonder argentina crying
extremly dull and boring musical that has few numbers , good actors .
this has to be one of the alltime worst movies . it is just hard watch as a story fails , musical terribly bad movie
it is so stupid .
what was the point of this movie other than to cash in on beatlemania ? no plot , weak soundtrack and worst all john's silliness .
'godspell' is better , more faithful to the bible .
bloody awful . one of the worst movies , musical or otherwise i've ever seen would make apostles think twice about their faith
theres no way a stupid preacher could control town like that banning rock music and dancing in the 80's 50's yes when there were so many corrupt towns corruption but not
retarded , juvenile drivel that appeals to the culturally deprived and weakminded . dated point copies of this dreck should be installed in smithsonian it's a wonder what crap captures imagination mongoloid american movie-going public
please ! this video stinks i wouldn't watch it again if you paid me
as far i'm concerned , when the '60's/70's ended so did appeal of this flakey film and play . actually having a desire to sit through it now would be like suddenly getting an urge wear bell bottoms tie-dyed t shirt wrap rag around my head go giving peace sign just isn't going happen
it starred elvis . no movie he in rates higher than a 1
oh lord in his heaven this is awful .
one of the crappiest musicals all time . based on a totally trivial premise , i.e. life notorious striptease artist only redeeming feature story is that it provided view in american entertainment history when vaudeville faded (for good reason) and first tame steps toward salacious fare surfaced songs are terrible rosalind russell overacts oversings overemotes shouts her way straight through this turkey : instead coming across as memorable remarkable woman performance flop-sweat approximation shrill pushy obnoxious proud vain self-centered would-be martyr menopausal biddy enough to make you puke natalie wood usually fine actress miscast result isn't too convincing karl malden puts his typical stolid measured workmanlike role such best it's wonder they did remake carwreck maybe figured for once could top original wouldn't be difficult but i hear sucked can't chicken salad out tuna salad..
painfully bad . the music is a mix of good and very actual movie just ridiculous
i like parts of this record , but was totally embarrassed for pete townshend and (especially) roger daltry when finally saw a bit on tv .
silly b-movie .
the real crime is that theme song ! killl it
since there are now two versions , my question is was anyone really buying glen close in this role ? meg ryan younger by a long shot and even she would be too old to play nellie . if they were just trying find work for older actresses why not let mitzi gaynor reprise the  tsk you enjoy story music stick with much superior 1950's version
this is the south pacific for tv verion i was subjected to last week , not rodgers and hammerstein original . first of all badly acted so why thow in a bunch swear words that will make it good 50 something nellie ? oh god throw horrible blood mary.. lots sex thanks guys typical america girls who holds out get guy girl gives up sits on side road selling junk nobody wants dose reality thankfully sleep claimed me an hour 45 minutes into show or may have had look at aweful selection joe cable hmm. ameil ok only cute about entire movie two little kids if hollywood whoever claims remake can't think new scripts they better there find writers
way too dark to be enjoyable .
why would any one make a sequal to snf wasn't the first movies bad enough . oh and it even better , sly is directing what mess they should have call saturday night fights in end beats hell out of john travolta
the fourth-rate sequel of a third-rate film that featured second-rate male lead . add fifth-rate director and score by sixth-rate musical act , you've got recipe for one worst motion pictures ever made stupendous waste stock
it's elvis for gods sake . nothing but a vehicle him and others to make money none of his movies featured any acting or even defineable storyline worth mentioning they are all one thing.. singing wee..
stupid , vapid concept with a 25 cent script lame acting aimless direction frenetic and visually unappealling dancing score that sounds as dated bee gees record . they even used body double for j beals' tushy scenes
jennifer lopez sucked back then as bad she does now .
rightfully reguarded as one of the worst movies ever made . not in way that plan nine from outer space is , just so bad it actually fun to watch but a painfull disappointing opening credits closing i can't believe george burns who usually rather good comic would have agreed appear this peice trash if you are beatles fan despite title urge skip movie had any respect for peter frampton since seeing dreck hard take him seriously anymore only redeaming quality about abomanation beauty actress played strawberry fields even though she couldn't act her out plastic bag when first heard was very excited being huge cast sounds like miss someone two minutes knew film be how comparison makes showgirls seem an oscar winner and biggest disappoints history whenever sgt pepper scheduled shown on tv (which rare thank god!!!!!) turn off my televison lest catch glimpse travesty there enough words english language or other describe hatered god-awful piece crap
this movie is so bad , pointless and wastes a lot of talent except for the bee gees who suck . should have never been made it horrifficly if you are any kind beatles fan do not see probably one worst movies ever only redeaming thing about aerosmiths version come together
so someone had the bright idea of making a movie out this landmark 60s album , and they chose peter frampton bee gees to star in it all people . no wonder 70s get bad rap
everyone connected with the making of this thing should be flogged .
i would like to been there when they came up with the idea for this movie . let's make a musical about beatles and not have ! then who will replace them ? bee gees great
this piece of trash is a total embarassment to anyone even remotely associated with it , an insult the underlying concept that was gravely compromised and perverted torture who might happen view . it's quest for failure when one tries develop feature film from something as minor narrow album but pinheads bankrolled churned out bucket vomit apparently didn't let caveat thinking get in their way any creative project world's lamest pop band those absolutely obnoxious tone deaf wimped bee gees doomed be disaster involving pathetic beatle-wannabes suspect initiative final death sentence
a film so lame that even highly unsophisticated audiences in those horrible times square moviehouses laughed it off the screen . shopworn and tired premise supported by really limp script , humdrum score featuring one of biggest no-talents ever as its female lead no wonder this picture bombed set back trumped-up artificial career mariah carey about ten years bimbo isn't bad to look at but her singing reminds you girl high school talent night who had couple voice lessons all taste delicacy jackhammer every line imposed upon pointless unessential vocal gymnastics dreadful listens crap anyway ? only reason no-talent got public eye is she dropped for idiotic t mottola when he was highflyer sony maybe there's future stroke films
mariah as an actress? ! you've got to be s*****n' me!!
more trash from moriah carey . get it through your skulls people , she can't sing !
mariah , you stick with singing and j-lo acting .
mariah carey is in this movie and it absolutely sucks !
ha,ha,ha,ha! ! i didn't even have to see this movie know it was one of the worst films ever created mariah and talent do not bekong in same sentence unless word bad is also used . story obvious has been run into growned over a hundred times now miss mariah's turn strange how she had mental breakdown just days before her opened doesn't seem like an desperate attempt stur up contoversy maybe temt some dim witted suckers seeing lame dare say cliched foulist depths hell peice poo cinema if you half brain , waist your cash message from anti - pop stars actor/actress comitee support real actors actress's film
only saw a few minutes of this horrid movie . i am glad american idol got wise after junk very sad kick back to the beach party movies from 60s kelly at least managed go on and have career as for justin,where is he now ?
first of all this movie sucks second is gay these 2 lame rods from american idol can not act they sing the music
the title , and stars of this film are reason enough to stay away .
from justin to kelly the toilet . producers should be shot
i guess you have to be an idol fan or 10 years old enjoy this . my pre-teen loved it she should rate it...ahhhhh!! ! justin , get a hair cut the is hidious
[just the sound of vomit]
wait a minute , is this for real ? they actually made sequel to 'grease' frightening .
pretty bad . grease 2 never should have happened unfunny and dumb michelle p did the best she could do with clunker thankfully it not stop her for going on to better movies
why couldn't they leave grease alone ?
other than the presence of michelle pfeiffer , there is nothing at all redeeming about this cheap film .
as if the first one wasn't bad enough .
'not a matt damon fan . went to see it only because my g/f wanted.. finally , i couldn't stand walked out and left said there get her ya-ya's looks more like secret agent intern
lmao at star wars . sucks
pluh-lease .
lame and dimwitted story line . b-movie material with an a-list budget proof positive of the disminished capacity ability american cinema
the best of 4  !
i would like to strangle my parents for making me watch this as much i'd friends forcing the new ones (even if they did pay) . you sit through these staar wars movie , loose interest think about anything but trying not fall asleep
star wars sucks
very bad!!! !
you call this movie sci-fi???? ?
really didn't like it
movie is too long and boring .
there was no salvaging this shipwreck .
soooo silly , sooooo cheesy plus it looks dated now but i will admit the special effects are awsome especially 4 it's time f/x does not compensate for a movie with grade z acting .
a snoozer .
total garbage . i tried as hard could to like this movie , but couldn't bad acting (natalie portman was awful sam jackson) the transformation vader wasn't believable- in a matter of minutes anakin goes from good ambivilent child killer stupid and darth walking frankenstien ? how about i've got higher ground wtf throughout prequels people jump over each other sword fights with no problem my biggest complaint- empire only existed for 18 years before new hope?? hope made it sound jedi were forgotten legends not goup that had disappeared two decades lame
i hated stars wars , revenge od the sith . thought is was soooo stupid don't see why it such a big deal to be released am so glad that this last one & won't ever have hear about after
i am sorry , tried really did but this movie is incredibly boring....drags on forever and ever .
needs tom bombadil!!! !
what a waste of time . i've never seen so many weird people in one movie theatre at once
first let me say that i have been reading sci fi and fantasy for 35 years but this movie was boring...it way to long with many bloated scenes
braveheart is one movie you don't want to see unless are interested in seeing how mel gibson takes a can of paint and dumps it over his head so he disguise himself from the men training horses . love scenes corny just too long
apparently , i'm one of the few who thinks differently than rest about this movie . i hated it beginning to come realization that hate fantasy sci-fi type movies last for hours did not appreciate star wars harry potter or read patter books and liked them fine considering reading these althought is a huge deterrent vow from day foward never sit through another like
even worse than the book .
long slow awful movie , dfficult to figure out on times including that overweight marlon brando sweating and mumbling his way through a load of bollocks in cave... .
not even stylish direction could save this tired mess of a movie epic . quite boring and enough substance to keep itself interesting or engaging
terrible
it just did not compare to my standard for great science fiction movies . had a lot of forced dialog , which is always annoying and lost the excitement heroism first movie felt as if lucas cared more about presenting his hindu idealogy than creating i like fictions that have intellectual value ridiculous child play tune eastern religeons
this movie was & is intended for small children , 4 to 6 years old . any older fans r looking escapism and if does it u may wanna check out mary poppins  !
not the only one , kristinand .
i must be only one who reallly hates all lord of the rings movies
boring
hated it . this was my favourite chapter of the lotr books , and peter jackson killed all major parts novel were missing- at end hobbits return to find that saruman is in shire without gandalf or aragorn they clean evil men (who tried kill frodo)- missing. looks like hollywood got their claws one- made new star wars movies look good maybe if you never read could be taken away by magnificent storyline- but tolkiens work- not time wasting did with tearful goodbyes have been utilised showing battle bad job- spoiled series for me
this movie sucked and that's about all i have to say .
the movie was pretty good . i'm only giving this a terrible rating , because i feel that it should be below matrix : reloaded most definitely
most boring peice of crap ever
i firmly believe that unless you have read the book and some kind of background story , won't like this movie much . it was frustrating to watch because really wanted enjoy but couldn't..because didn't know characters understand what going on nor did care
way too over the top , and boring for me . special effects are very limited as well any good acting
despite an excellent performance by ian mckellan , the film is a waste of time and offers nothing . wasted with only 20 minutes screen entire movie one big boxing match there not interesting moment in this
nothing special.. . the movie sucks
this gets a one because it isnt out yet , and the annoying cultish hobbit lovers have already started to rate .
i'll be back and it gets boring , though it's pretty classic because of the arnold in uniform at least i like gnr soundtrack . watching once would enough
i think these are both really bad movies .
stupidest movie i have ever seen and it was soo cheesy fell asleep watching . on funnyparts soooo dumb a waist of my time think that you should consider burrning ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !
how could they do this to dumas ? awful , adaptation . read the book instead
this movie is one of the worst ever made , i know have seen almost all sci-fi movies after 1980 has stiff acting if you were riding on a roller coaster you'd fall asleep watching . give it 2 thumbs way down
had some funny moments , but overall this movie isn,t holding up very well .
this movie was terrible ! the book so much better than i would never reccomend to anyone
this movie was horrible , just insanely i will never like . it the only reason might watch is if am 65 and had to save my life effects were acting stiff everyone did a bad job on
a boring , tedius pessimsitic sci-fi film that is terribly overrated the matrix combines objectionable content with plot creeps you out . star trek best franchise there so watch hundreds of hours brilliant than this movie
drug addled nightmare .
ok , i know there's a huge legion of fans.. . but this movie really sucks and keanu reeves too (he's not an actor) the good point is just for fx
this movie would get five stars from me if it was original but it's just a mishmash of modern sc-fi stories most notibly the works william gibson and unpublished novel 'the morpheus files : hypercity' that doing rounds us publishing houses in mid nineties . now there may be nothing new under sun i many my friends find hard to enjoy film where almost every scene reminds or short story not only did first also much better
a too long videoclip devoid of any sense humour , acting or cinematography . someone went berserk with computer fx but didn't get them right i've seen games that had better graphics and textures lot really no plot to speak script not movie ;
well said , genghis in hindsight this movie did suck .
flashy and pseudo philisophical , it did not have a logical argument . was too concocted good piece of sci-fi genre but the plot illogical had major holes
boring homosexual promotion .
despite the film's complimentary reviews and it's growing legion of fans , it is terrible . a special effects extravaganza not much more somewhat confusing plot long periods unexciting storyline don't help this movie live up to comic book beginnings maybe can all be summed in two words : keanu reeves
quite a waste of my time , the people's and academy award voter's judgement . granted an epic film is very tough task to undertake but mel gibson falters on every level here plummeting beautiful story into little more than something throw popcorn at his acting was ridiculous overdone while scenery (but not atmosphere) visually pleasing he give viewer no chance bask in it way should drama all false
i don't like it one bit . except the fact tom cruise is in otherwise its just a stupid , broing movie that talks and
puerile and obvious beyond belief , not to mention jingoistic . a disgusting movie i wanted take shower after watching ten minutes of it
rent the film sleep with me  . in it quentin terrentino explains why this is gayest movie ever made you'll never watch same way again
no comment.. .
the first time i watched it almost fell asleep .
dreadfully dull , alternating with smarmy .
overrated as a sci-fi film . basically b-horror movie in outer space star trek is an infintely better franchise
completly unoriginal . contains you're basic components for a scary movie ripoff of an even older sci-fi
alien is one of the worst movies ever made .
should have been called "conan the annoyer."
terrible sequel to the much better 1979 film . only things that aren't so bad about it are seeing wilt in barbarian gear and asian guy , shaman who hangs out with conan  : his real name is mako incredibly cool voice.it's awful otherwise
the movie should be destroyed along with conan..... .
i thought the first episode was bad , but this one is so much worse . good thing about that we see very little of jar anakin a whole lot older now and start becoming bit rebellious i'm sorry hayden christiansen just doesn't seem like right person to do job his acting horrible - he seemed be as competent 7th grader putting on middle school play storyline pathetic if you ask me everything happens way too fast it's nothing develops jango fett's involvement in movie seems unecessary well there's action aside from yoda's lightsaber scene none it nearly could've been clone wars really cool concept made great with phantom menace lucas mucked up
i have seen vacation videos that are more interesting than this .
the nifty special effects could not save horrendous acting . george lucas has finally lost his mind there was no good performance even christopher lee couldn't deliver join dark side speech in a way that didn't sound exactly like first one from vader crowning achievement this horrible travesty of film skywalker sr goes to rescue mother i literally crying with laughter when she looked up into her son's eyes , just barely holding onto life and says ani ? is you oh you're so handsome what visit grandma's perfectly awful only parts enjoyed were dialogue ruin it
the best of star trek movies . rest don't even deserve one when i saw this kept waiting for tattoo to run in yelling boss , ze starship
little screen material .
trekkies *shudder*
i'm not a star trek fan at all and quite sure why i actually saw this movie . thought it was horrible kept waiting for herve villecheve to come out give mr rork hand
another tim burton mess . the thing that amazes me about all recent batman movies is main character villain in this case joker played by jack ! movie so dark and casting of michael keaton still boggles mind i found it to be very disappointing
holy hollywood hell ! i love tim burton's work when it suits his mindset , but this was all wrong . and michael keaton like casting john wayne as attila the hun will somebody shoot robert wuhl please ?
one of the most idiotic , silly and unbelievable movies to become a hit  ! truly terrible if you think this is good movie that says lot about !!
even though the female terminator was cool , it still sucked !
i remember going to see this the very first day it came out and was a big dissapointment . would have been alot better if james cameron directed edward furlong in
i really wasn't impressed with this. . ok , fantastically done action scenes amazing special effects and that is it you can tell this film centered around arnie doesn't pay off the script was bitty no-where near as thought provoking previous two a massive disappointment
t3 was a joke . did they writers even watch the first two movies? ? butchered storyline , and ruined trilogy previous movies were serious with some comedy...this comedy bad graphics are suppose to make things look more real not totally abstract (see t2 idiots) i think much better....and sound....bad sound....what happened no fate but what we make....the future isn't written??? then why hell does j conner have solemate this another stupid chosen one movie where he is destined glory just happens be who saves day in end jesus figure....writters took stuff from matrix thrusted it into complex story t1 had good significant action scenes plot yes amount of crap that shoved complicated don't know exactly people need none stop fans liked effects actually still how skynet built despite work dyson short acting sound  legitimate connection so respect for james cameron never knew
even the most fascinating , excellent special effects can't save this flop based on hit comic book series .
i could only give this movie one star because of the entertainment . as a itself it was worst movies have ever seen seriously not even sit through there were many actors and actresses that took part in but how good they act if had screenplay pathetic don't get me wrong love comics marvel heroes portrayl rogue sabertooth saved where heck is gambit ?
x-men was more of a movie for kids . it's that has no point the ending makes sense and resolves nothing is cartoon should remain
x-men seemes like a promising movie . my favorite wolverine failed to meet the standard special effects were pretty cool but overall story didn't go anywhere action is low and plot an absolute disaster
i would like to say that this is an outstanding movie , true the x-men fans of last 30+ years . unfortunately my religious convictions don't allow me lie story was sophomoric (freshmoric actually but isn't a word) fight scenes were so poorly choreographed thought watching superman (you know christopher reeves movie) casting excellent ; too bad actors didn't have anything with which work hopefully simply first issue intro into better series (boy am glad went matinee.)
i joyfully pass on all the potter garbage , books and movies .
i do not like this movie because it condones witchcraft and black magic , which is clearly evil something we are to stay away from . when dealing with demonic powers don't have magical there no such thing as using for good maybe the person may be in their mind but that power devil he mucking around fooling them into believing they his lots of bible verses speak against arts astrology psychics fortune tellers etc some people think white whether or still god hates physical eg spells doing a lot stuff on harry potter charmed psychic manipulating people's emotions will telling satan's throwing your steak dinner lions rip up eat turn you pieces satan horrible unfair bank dealer most banks charge interest lends money charges 200%
the only reason i saw this movie is because everyone was reading books , how foolish . hated it boring and uninteresting plot pathetic simplistic.i wish in these childish movies that good lost againest evil for once so they wouldnt bother me with next
bite my shiney metal arse .
annoying trash , with possibly the worst assembly of child actors in history . fact that it slavishly follows book is no plus my view
how long can a movie be , and still feel like something was missing . the editing horrible scene cuts were somebody bumping needle on record player ouch ! but my kids loved it
complete and total bull sh*t .
the problem with humanity !
eat my shorts .
so stupid !
ummmmm..... . sucks the big one
just to tell you how much i hate harry potter/the movie/ the books , wish there was something less than 1 star!! ! could give it like a 1/18 of star . him people are getting too excited about this guy that does magic!
i didn't see it yet . know that doesn't desserve to be above requiem for a dream , that's damn sure !
one of the most boring sci-fi movies i have ever sat and squirmed through . encounter was just too close stifling for me to repeat
i mean honestly , kubrick is not that good at all . he has always been overrated and especially this particular movie of his it sucked real bad one those times when can say the word suck exactly what did..it was just horrendous in every way started out wierd ended most people would be confused by whole atrocity so don't recommend to anyone beginning many movies director...
a failed attempt at the antagonist as protaganist genre . worse than such cinematic bowel movements hannibal or interview with vampire how can we identify main character ? alex was euro-trash fruitcake in bad '70s threads , and despite inherent fruity factor he still managed to be rapist prick i personally think should have been caned on public television until stopped screaming brokered russian porn ring forced serve fat men for rest of his brief aids-infected existence
like all kubrick films , this movie is completely useless .
terrible , o se habla espa ol . what kind of a name for movie is that clockwork orange if i went to theater watching this i'd have wear paper bag over my head nothing about was interesting fell asleep even though the playing in surround sound
predictable , badly filmed and charleton heston's acting is so bad it would knock a hound-dog off gut wagon .
crap !
although the thought of passengers in space is cool , film boring tedious and just plain unimaginative . compared to brilliance found various star trek incarnations 2001 seems grounded a sort reality also long portions drag on without any humor action or dialogue i can't watch this getting sleepy
confusing , irritating absolutely no plot at all and annoying music . 90% of the time it was just abstract pictures special effects with meaning few interactions between characters were boring i still think they least worst parts movie my sister went shopping right after had begun when she returned 2 hours later asked me why in same place as left to sum up : there are surely better things do your not even worth renting people only praise because makes them look intellectual
an appalling film ! may possibly have a strange appeal to pseudo-intellectual types , but has no soul . sorry
i hate to see how people praise this movie . personally think it's crap despite that it is kubric's don't any reason for exist at all..
crap , really crap.. . the beginning seemed good but then....went down
i wish there was a rating lower than terrible.... .
i vaguely remember seeing this , and vividly the bad taste afterward as though had eaten a whole box of twinkies .
just one long commercial for a bunch of bad video games .
i would've been really depressed after seeing this movie if actually cared . probably someone born 1985 might think is high art , since crappy movies were the norm by then but thinking it don't make so lucas should give money back for one.did noone see stark resemblance in plot to first ? i'm supposed believe a 6-year old can fight space battle you mean darth vader grown up and chasing luke down death star trench doesn't have flash of deja vu say hmm. maybe not gonna win all...this reminds me when was kid.. maul came went jar wouldn't go away couldn't heads or tails out murky political subplot sucked even more than howard duck
what the hell happened ? george takes 15 years off from saga and loses all touch with original concept . where is this going even after seeing clones , i still don't know why he's taking route think *i* could write it better
sucked . this movie completly ruined the franchise darth maul was only cool character and they killed him off what were thinking ?
never have i been so disappointed in anything my entire life . george lucas robbed me of sense adventure trade for some petty computer-generated special effects when watch or even think about the original trilogy feel empty inside thanks
star wars : the phantom meanace is first of new trilogy that george lucas has come out with . it in fact a badly made film annoying characters and no plot or storyline whatsoever acting was terrible , you can't ask an 8-year old boy to take role 30-year man took 25 years ago
because it was produced , boxed and shown in movie theaters this film gets a 1 rating . george lucas is not only racist but he has no creative taste or ability jar-jar binks performs the slave role quite well all scenes can be used as form of cruel unusual punishment obi-wan played by mcgregor looks hungover his while liam neeson decided that did pay him enough to show emotion best actor 9 year old who half way through also joins fellow actors emotionless acting stay away from
with star wars , george lucas turned the film industry on its head . phantom menace joined rest of in superficial marketing-fest does not have uncorrupted feel (the original 1977 version of) episode i takes itself far too seriously it has no wit great chemistry between stars and hardly any character development actors do very little to create sympathy all that barely enough plot fill a midichlorian's left nostril but what about inside jokes ? hear you whine them if want bunch gratuitous i'll watch latest disney movie
phantom menace is vacuous technical wizardry .
this movie sucks . christopher lambert is not a good actor and sean connery must have been needing some quick cash to star in junk i know has huge following , but i'm still trying figure out why
this movie is such a far cry from the in your face , heartstopping blood chilling action filled franchise that it takes it's name could almost be spinoff . i did not like film at all whole gentler-kinder misunderstood alien angle (at least that's what got out of it) didn't do anything for me was bad enough to make glad sigourney has said she'll never fifth i'll keep my fingers crossed
dont make em like this anymore.... .
some how they managed to make a more uninteresting movie than the first , amazing ! anyone could enjoy this bothers hell out of me nothing personal though each his own but i really hate harry pothead because felt like bad acid trip . and piper norman : yes he is
grow up !
as if the first one wasn't bad enough . only redeeming feature here was branagh's performance , although even that isn't to award another star
a pure mess , by horrible director . unfortunately the once again brought down bunch of great talent...too bad..
this movie was okay , but should be further down on the list .
crap
horrible , thats all i have to say .
one of the biggest disappoints i have ever seen . just another cheep rehash a tired plot , with stupid and predictable lines
unnecessary use of special effects on jodie foster's teeth during her 'endeavor' , she doesn't need to look any scarier than already is .
horrible ! i expected more alien contact . the movie dragged on and and...
got to be one of the all time terrible movies ever made..... .
not fit to hold wrath of khan's jockstrap . the only reason this movie (or any later movies , especially old trek/tng crossovers) succeed is that there a nation pasty maladjusted trekkies out sustaining industry from comfort their parents' basements i like trek too because it such deeply detailed subject but these are just pander
same crap different movie . make it stop
i think this movie was soooo boring . fell asleep during the first ten minutes of me and my friend only rented that because we saw everything else already
i'm not sure why , but all the next generation movies just sucked . i liked every one of old and star trek : was cool generations movie good starting with first contact voyager started to suck
fake !
never seen anything so stupid in all my life!!!!! !
i'd have been happier if they stayed away from my home .
anyone who thinks brendan fraser is funny needs a lobotomy .
too old
why would you want to make a movie out of terrible series?? ? they already tried lost in space , and we saw how bad that turned . the x-files is about 2 secret agents who are on fight save future...duh
it won an oscar . had the funny jim carrey and beautiful kate winslet but i frankly found one of most boring , stultifying wearisome movies have seen in a long time right up there with death-inducing dogville terms boredom we watched night wifey passed out 10 minutes made to 15 she blamed me that looking at my droopy eyes her fall asleep tried again couple nights later konked 8 this while pretty much drifted off sleep about same juncture as previous chutzpah say next morning still want see now how good movie could be if puts 2 fairly intelligent adults twice ? theory is just can't stand charlie kauffman being john malkovich almost stupid looked like such dork oscars during his acceptance speech 30 seconds 29 find very unsettling 26 think any thing so distracting 24 seconds..
poorly written , directed and acted . jim carrey turned in the usual horrible manic performance female lead was equally bad plot idiotic easily worst movie of year to date
from the trailers and reviews , one gets impression that this of those moronic angst-ridden pseudo-art films . boring !
the abyss is where this mess belongs .
you know what ? hollywood won't stop making these movies until we watching them . will continue to see terrible special effects and even worse acting wasting our money the mummy is one of many perfect examples worthlessness that are being tossed in direction for love god don't watch this movie
another uninspired sci-fi movie that can't hold half a candle to the brilliance of star trek .
really butt awful . think of all the hungry poor people we could've fed with money they spent on this turkey
this is quite simply one of the worst movies all time . plot not well contrived , nor story set properly characters and scenes are very surrealistic almost to point existentialism humorous portions film rather transparent predictable special effects mediocre i cannot recommend movie anyone while chris tucker was funny he also tedious unnecessary additionally love thin under developed gary oldman just stupid : so much that believe his performance in lost space better than
the plot has no cohesion at all- it meanders through an eternity of disjointed situations . special effects and bizarre sensationalism are not enough to hold my interest without a
it is a cheap , unorignal remake of movie called war the worlds . acting was poor plotline totaly unrealistic and ending to pat easy nothing scary or surprising about this one
like all shamalyan films , boring poorly-acted and shameful .
this movie was not scarry at all,it boring . and it sucked,a lot of my friends told that a movie.[not true]im giving one star
you are an alien race , super higly intelligent capable of space travel and plantetary domination . so why i ask would to try dominate a world which is 75% water something that your biggest weakness just alone kills all credibility the plot makes movie terrible also whole divine intervention man angry at god etc doesn't go with invasion subplot it was not least bit scary...well scared if died on way home this be last thought my mind perhaps expecting same quality as in sixth sense unbreakable guess wrong director didn't even come close there were many little tangents he went out attempt tie them together characters had no development inconistant wife could see things she gonna die but couldn't surprise ending aliens looked like atheletes body paint when embattled earth dealing killing thousands people media wait until after commercial announce primative miracle weapon  ?
i was expecting the movie to be alot better than this . it sucked big time , didn't get
that movie was so boring ! there only one scary part in the whole film . when alien thingy walked out from behind bushes i laughed at most of it like where they had tin foil on their heads
painfully lame .
okay , i'm sorry to say this but i hated movie . all of the characters have exactly one facial expression - disturbed aside from that would been a much better story if they had left whole alien thing mystery actually bring them out and cut off their fingers.. well lost me there
this movie sucked ass .
i don't understand how any postpubescent human being could think the premise of this show is interesting or reasonable in least . intellectually (almost comically) puerile , comic book material for teenagers
way too conufusing , not enough action .
ugh . when john carpenter and kurt russell combine , the result is always taseless uninspired they should both have stuck to comedy (although this unintentionally funny in parts)
i won't let averages play a role in being better movie . this one was terrible!!!! !
i think the movie is not as good it advertised on tv or radio . comics and series were great but s*** ***destroy everything***
this movie absolutely sucked . the tv show and ads for made it even more of a let down was confusing waste time , money effort
the single worst movie made about arthurian legends . nice shiny armour though
the glossiest armor in middle ages couldn't hide dimness of this movie , but lord knows they tried .
a disappointing adaptation of the book although few sci-fi movies do that really well . most irritating thing was , while i understand product placement would seem necessary evil in modern hollywood movie this seemed little more than 90 minute commercial with poorly interpreted story wrapped arond it
i've decided that the incredibly positive reviews of minority report are result emperor's new clothes phenomenon . that's only way i can explain how such a horrible movie could receive accolades across board here my major complaints : 1 plot was flimsy and even ridiculous in many spots 2 there almost no character development 3 special effects were ludicrous inconsistent 4 acting terrible 5 far too long , ending laughable other problems with but don't have two more hours to record them all comment say is avoid this at costs !
i can't give this movie more than 1 star because while i'm glad saw it once , just so could say wouldn't want to sit through again . the whole premise of was stupid me : thought overstyled and way too ostentatious (tried hard be cool) examples include those gloves that agents would wear when they were going electronic files waving their arms dramatically in air lame why not have a futuristic mouse pointer ? or one glove spielberg had make dramatic look cool would've been cooler if you didn't need operate thing better yet even move on another note keeping three psychic folks floating pool ectoplasmic milk hokey believed also think there some scenes made gratuitously gross got under your skin  but pay $7.50 see spraying vomit bloody eyeballs rotten sandwiches paid thought-provoking sure as hell get what for apparently since stanley kubrick died steven has suffering from delusions he's reincarnated wish his inner circle pull him aside tell we don't at very least try mimic movies he needs avoid gross-out factor - can dark funny disturbing without gratuitous shots
i hated this movie ! the music made me physically sick .
i have never been sodimized with a broomstick and thanks to dark city , there was no messy clean up . this movie is some 18 years old bathroom fantasy where the reality of life changed by creepy aliens wearing dead bodies only scary thing about realization that you are now 1 hour closer death because wasted your time
this movie was horrible . i needed a flashlight to watch thing the lighting so bad acting kiefer sutherland had most annoying voice
more like matrix regurgitated,this movie reeks .
utter garbage . pseudo philosophy that wouldn't fool an intelligent junior high-school student apparently there aren't to many of those rating it here
both movie and video game sucked
far too much talking.absolute crap
the first one was good , and instead of sticking with what made it brothers put out a big steaming pile crap
i couldn't believe how bad this movie stunk . would have rather spent my money on seeing x2 again
this was terrible . they completely destroyed any resemblance movie might have had to the original tv series , which fantastic
one dozen too many apes .
this was one of the worst movies i have ever witnessed!how can it be rated so high ?
lame , flat rip-off of aliens and other much better bug-eyed monster flicks a complete waste an intriguing concept -- monsters in the darkness most literal sense .
one of the worst movies ever made! ! i want my money back!
this movie was completely without merit . from unbelievable plot lines to some of the most authentic 1970 special effects and graphics i've ever seen , had a terrible odor which could not be extinguished i am utterly amazed that others rating have managed rate it so high characters are unbelievably shallow predictable found myself laughing as each character picked off if you should decide ignore my warning watch ready laugh keep in mind law energy conservation cannot upheld by theory set forth like vin diesel know girls find him hot but he made huge mistake when
i loved the first movie , but this  . oh man they could have done so much with it seems chose not to ! in handled cg and special effects beautifully one seemed slacked off quite a bit (not that can do better scorpion at end was mind-numbingly horrible!) zepplin bad idea since sais originate from 1600's okinawa as farming tool it's kind of hard accept ancient egypt possessed these things weapons back then doing face-in-the-sand thing kinda cool face-in-the-water repetative for rock fans--he's only all maybe two minutes which is spent horrible replication him you'd be seeing king if you want see altogether watch by means just know you've been warned
not since batman and robin have we seen a sequel worse .
this movie was so cliched and predictable that i found myself crying laughing with insanity at the same time from stupidity
a textbook example of how to make bad movie out good book .
it was so predictable that i fell asleep- at the movies , and never do :)
thank god those aliens had windows '95 are we were all screwed . why revive the first lady twice just to kill her off in an anti-climactic scene ? was bill pullman doing a bad eastwood impression judd hirsch even worse jackie mason did annoying guy from big chill save earth (goldblum dead on but dreadful of himself that movie) how can will smith drag alien colorado utah and back nevada one afternoon it take hundred machine guns when knocked him out with punch for two days last time what point teasing harry conick , jr character without developing enough should care he died brain moviegoers so easily manipulated by things go boom they don't notice plot holes because budget star cast i declare this movie as worst waste celluloid history world!!! !
independence day isn't even a movie , it is product . something made to make money and bundles of for several different corporations next this completly unbelievable shallow i could see like happening one (riiiight) two doofuses will smith (i actually really guy) jeff goldblum getting an alien spaceship flying the mother ship takeing everything down with help apple computer laptop people who crap godzilla(america's mathew broderick version),dante's peak deep blue sea all show no blow completley placement large gross go if you ritualistic torture think i'll my room watch earth stood still have fun your kiddie
will smith was terrible in men black , so why would you sign him up to play another sci-fi based character?? ? independence day is one movie that i could have missed .
i will never understand why this movie made so much money . the only rational explanation can think of is that americans (and foreign audience too) wanted to see white house blown up...sad , sad state affairs when a box office smash
terrible , horrible disgusting . it's a pity to see how the money is spent on this way
this movie was bad
i walked out on it . guess i'm just not into jodie foster's latest movies
right down there with battlefield earth . this is a terrible movie and i've written numerous reviews on it.. i won't get into it now - there's simply too much to talk about i'm surprised that so many people can't see how stupid
these movies (independence day and armegeddon) are extremely egocentric , geocentric over blown budgeted pieces of trash that do nothing but perpetuate america's inflated view itself as the world's savior .
hahahahahaahahaahah !
why anyone wants to discover this crap is beyond me .
i saw this movie in the theater and it really stinks . my suit for money back is still pending !
just awful . stupid jack nicholson's worst movie
absolutely wretched . i'll admit that i watched it once out of sheer curiousity and was amazed at the utter stupidity nicholson close are wasted here
without a doubt one of the stupidest , most idiotic movies i've ever seen . it was almost like producers and directors movie had some kind contempt for going public
one of the only films where i walked out theatre within half an hour .
i have seen better flops from a fish on river bank.. .
a dark , pessimsitic profanity-laced time travel tale . star trek time-travel adventures are millions of times better !
i'm sorry to say but i really hated this movie . it was predictible , annoying and not thrilling at all the directing worst thing about is a waste of time !
a yucky movie based on bad video game series . give me mario or poke'mon instead
if you are going to tell one of histories greatest storys don't mess with it . achilies never sees the inside troy as he is shot in heal biggest parts homer's story but hollywood comes along and change a major part effects were nice acting was not that great neither script
nothing could have prepared me for the torrent of bile script spewing from a greek epic dire , sluggish tedious and asinine proportions as this joke farcical hollywood movie . many bad films i saw year one topped pole easily it made van helsing look like cult classic gothika hitchcock inspired film that loathsome cold mountain historical in same league gone with wind believe wasn't has to take home prize worst surely troy is it's times these you can see importance actors having some classical training majority them were reciting their lines if they reading rostrum camera at auto-cue cards brad pitt looked somewhat god but achilles he californian surfer preparing friend's themed halloween party orlando bloom gorgeous let's face can't act his life depended on relies supporting cast save talent women's roles awful simple eye candy damsel distress playthings much depth merky puddle diane kruger part helen she failed make her character more than two-dimensional believeable eric bana almost courageous heroic hector didn't engage bored silly fight scene between himself was good what shocked most watched hector's death watching bug killed bathtub there no sincerity valuable loss all peter o'toole father paris showed younger generation how play prevented tumbling further into horrendous tedium felt students graduation member audience pulled thrown out simply put terrible !
this was a piece of f**** c*** it sh** movie
a movie for geriatrics . old people who get renewed vigor due to sucking the life force of couple unhatched aliens this is supposed be an uplifting film ? probably biggest and worst oversight that with all , they still have thin disgusting bodies you frolic gross !
one of the worst hollywood propaganda movies about global warming . you don't like ? fine , make a movie better than this ! they run from cold in awful excuse actually stay out randy quaid actuallly sacrifices useful man to save son that may or not be alive he finds him and when knocks on door get looks their faces as if decided try them again sela ward stays with child no right mind would people freeze instantly safety after discover flood waters have frozen it's odd jake all survive main family always survives disaster magnitude i will say : scenes involving three guys monitoring buoys coast were great wish more
as a geo-science major in college -- i have to say this movie breaks all rules of geophysics --- and really just basically sucks . what joke especially the insta-freeze solid objects like buildings another hollywood pos offering
really dumb movie . it seemed like a made by the green party to convince us stop driving cars or this will happen it's totally ridiculous whole united states was destroyed but they were saved moving mexico not only is script reallly special effect weren't impressive either hardly watchable
the sad part was , they found bastard .
i was ready to start an insurrection when saw it . and that just on video
easily the worst of ten trek treks . it looks like was filmed on someone's ranch in california come , people spend a little money you've got an oscar-winning actor portraying villain and talented crew board enterprise why waste such cast lame plot about fountain youth with sub-par special effects ? horrible
why is this so high on the list?! ! -- i'll fix that . people , part of really bad existentialist trilogy (with 1 5) fountain youth planet does not a good and believable plot make plays like an overlong episode series indeed essentially rips off some same plots from next gen all attempts at humor are flat stupid downright embarrassing regulars seem ashamed to be in movie there parts here but as whole it desperately needed lot work
this is one of the worst star trek movies yet . it features terrible acting , little/no storyline and also no accuracy within world unfortunately movie could be made by monkeys without typewriters
this movie is like having extensive dental work . you are very relieved when its over
steven spielberg missed the mark . stanley kubrick how many must ? this film is bad a modern day retelling of pinoccio , leaves much to be desired it not lack good effects or dialog i was just board anything like what had expected and felt mockery might entire has wholly surrealistic quality which found very bothersome end anticlimactic with major let down
what the hell is this crap???? ?
very weak flick . spielberg successfully captured every cliche you can think about from previous science fiction stories the entire movie is one big hey , i saw that in another
a jacked up version of the good son . think about similarities both movies have biggest name child actor day , who usually plays nice sweet roles playing twisted kid they turn against other and fight for mother's love this movie was overwhelmingly boring last 20 minutes were probably most meaningless moments my life i that is what hell like you are forced to watch clips long no purpose only reason went see because girlfriend's cousin jake thomas human even her family thought slow stupid it well marketed if remember trailers basically left everything imagination everybody assumed spielberg osmet would team masterpiece but turned out be disaster
i think this movie (like eyes wide shut) is a case of the emperor's new clothes with those desperate to accepted , by psuedo-intellectual wanna-bee's repeating ridiculous comments ; wonderous brilliant etc . blechhhh!!!! ! film was too long and boring there no point it story kid/robot extremely creepy would have had him destroyed real kid dying virus up around within ten minutes?!? husband brought thing home then hates it?!? none made any sense alien/robots? fairy statue that after two thousand years looks been painted day? in fact entire stupid our opinion mr spielberg has dropped considerably definitely worst ever associated do not waste your money on this!!!
robocop sucks
dragonheart was such a terrible and embarrasing film . the whole entire plot all of bad acting , it just really
this movie was deplorable in every aspect ! from the slow boring beginning to overly predictable ending , i could barely sit still through . as tempted fastforward entire thing forced myself it order give a fair rating granted producers were going for black and white effect something classy memories an archaic past blah is only reason why got 1 star no that's not right it's because couldn't big fat 0!! violence uncalled even felt sorry those women my wife had leave room she so offended thank god daughters weren't home night chose watch how somebody write up such ghastly horror wannabe flick beyond me sure like cheaper gross-out scale bravo producers/writers giving more serial killers out there ideas on murder now we have crazy men portrayed acts hanging women's heads walls mantels eating live flesh their fingers forcing them being done enough said absolute crap don't waste your time won't mention acting much of comment
this was a childish attempt at movie . the plot shallower and more cliche riddled than any every made graphics were not good as everyone claims , definitely do add to piece of garbage is bust justly so joke company that
video games should never be made into movies . look at super mario brothers
drug induced .
saw this as a kid and didn't understand any of it . now i'm grown i but hasn't improved
the motionless picture . just thinking about it makes .. me zzzzz
completely boring . kirk talks to a computer haven't i heard that before ? too similiar the plot used throughout series
dull
it works . because daredevil , much like ben afflick is the worst in his trade crappy story + actor = film
ben affleck is the worst actor ever .
the lone star is for jenny and her hot everything . i'd rather see aflac goose in a movie than that affleck ben , acting not your thing
simple minded movie , made by simpletons . the portrayal of chaucer is particularly ludicrous
boring garbage . not even laughable
the best thing about this movie is that it was mentioned in an episode of simpsons .
boring !
i didn't find this movie to be interesting at all . it's just absolutely ridiculous it makes you think about what you'd do if a huge meteor were kill everyone on the planet , but that's good for not entertaining stupid as course of action world leaders take attempt save earth is logical letting satanist give sermon easter sunday
jeez i hate michael bay and jerry bruckheimer . the sappiness cornyness was spewing out my ears when left theater they try to hard keep a pg-13 rating , which makes them absolute phonies horror...the horror..
armegeddon is a total waste of your time . the movie too long and extremly boring dull there are no exciting scenes you can't tell what anyone really talking about i would stick to something else
awful , cheesy cheap sets that are reminiscent of 50's era b-grade sci-fi ; emotionally manipulative storyline with little depth unbelieveable scenarios supposed to make us cheer the good guys but instead wonder what were they thinking ? and finally a favorly canned ending . another usa saves world movie ala independence day !
what a dumb movie ! another piece of bad entertainment from jerry bruckheimer . this film is loud , and full special effects ; no one with half brain would believe the plot sending oil drills into space to blow up an asteroid filled cliche's too quirky comic relief characters self-sacrifice bruce willis at end poor excuse show expensive cgi scene paris blowing
i rated armageddon a 1 b/c it is heavily hyped movie w/ no plot , good acting and sick technology will save us-america can do anything metality !
tedious . plodding infinitely dull a waste of fine comedic talent
boy would i like to see robin williams play , oh say a cannibalistic pedophile who's executed at the end of movie . his cloying bloodless portrayals 'heartwarming' characters makes me want puke
one of the worst movies this decade : awful , pretentious and incredibly dull . speech that nick nolte (playing hulk's sinister mad scientist father) gives near end his transformation into some sort elemental creature are so laughably ludicrous i almost couldn't believe my eyes ears avoid if at all possible !
awful ! terrible , angst-ridden nonsense
hey ang , i thought it was three strikes and your out you must have lips on the right asses.. .
awful movie ! by far the worst blockbuster of year . what clumsy , pompous lackluster boring directing this was only part that true to spirit comic hulk battling tanks dogs were dumb letting banner's father person he hates most talk him knowing he'll likely piss off and make em change into escape making in water tank without having a way contain ending script so dadpan split screens soundtrack oppressive out place how can you boring?? ? i felt nothing for banner unlike bill bixby's character who really sympathized with thanks ang kee destroying should have been great excited marvel
this was an awful film it went on for way to long and there were many science bits blabering about nothing how did the hulk lose all his clothes except pants ?
3 fight scenes?i am sorely disappointed in ang lee.the scenes were perfect,but too few.story really lacked considering more than three quarters of the movie focuses on it .
i hated the fantastic four movie it had mostly lame characters . for example invisible woman was such and bitch mean she dumped a awesome guy just because couldn't get her way thing so you look like rock over ! oh pleez human torch an @$$hole with no personality  , he total bastard on comercials they made him out to be coolest character ever but sucked!! only that liked honestly mr likeable didn't even want put as much focus or
i give this movie one fantastic star . it sucked
angelina jolie still sucks .
sucks , it is poorly written . the only reason to see angelina jolie
when trinity is dying . neo : no ! you can't die yes i can lame vs smith dragonball z fight sucked the first one a classic , second was ok this blows goats
i'm so very disappointed ! i mean was a major matix fan . both of the first two movies were good what chances they would totally bomb on last one sorry but movie terrible director kills hero and main character maybe from foregin films nobody else is that stupid
huh ? what in the whole of hell was this movie about are any matrix movies
i thought this movie was pathetic . it reminded me of return the king , there's really nothing besides fighting plot is quite horrible just plain stupid
this movie was lame . the whole train station scene retarded french guy got punked out way to easy neo fights like a sissy in real world then we're forced watch morphus and crew fly ship for 2 hrs as lamer characters defend club zion final fight dragon ball z rip off ending sucked big time they didn't even explain anything it just ended with old bag architect (aka colonel sanders) talking at park wtf ? o yeah trinity dies so does how do you them apples
fell asleep . it was like watching someone else play a video game
my opinion , to like this movie you have take the blue pill . revolutions is better then reloaded that sets bar at about ground-- level with rocky ii aliens terminator 2 god father as examples of sequels worthy originals;lets reset bar.pretend directly follows matrix now do some keanu math : high expectations [(empty digital spectacle + meaningless characters) gutted original characters] x stupefying wizard oz plot turns =revolution bogus dude! !
the first movie i give a - 5 second 3 if you want to see with good plot go kill bill . understood everything was saying but it so stupit
this movie is horrible . i am not sure what the other people on page were smoking when they saw it , but must have been out of their mind writing was plot predictable and uninteresting for most hoping that machines would win kill all these whining pathetic characters a greater dissapointment than star wars episode everything good about first two movies absent from one
well , plot has never exactly been a strength with this series . the special effects were decent but was totally ludicrous and acting bad too there's 2 sequences you can laugh at though one is on plane there where sam neill dreams that raptor talking to him second when they find cellphone in huge pile of dinosaur turds suddenly ceratosaur runs up just looks them before ambling off otherwise it's awful
pure crap . i cannot believe that the jurassic park saga has ended on this sad , note and to think first movie was so good want my money back next time see a dinosaur will take out camcorder some toy dinos....surely can do better than
what is it with sequels never knowing when to stop , especially large creatures are envolved . jaws and jurassic park were fantastic movies but there was absolutly no need make more of them the only reason i even watched this movie because somebody playing in room would have spent money see i'm glad didn't
i wasn't impressed with the first one , why would even go to see any sequals ?
movie was absolutely forgetable . the typical useless action drivel that dominates scene these days one of worst movies year
what really burns me about this flick is that martha sent to wal-mart buy some doo-dad she read in insert ad the paper . now knew my "never again wal-mart" vow , but quite frankly scarlett didn't give a damn ! i digress walked by bargain dvd bin and lo behold here was "league of extraordinary gentlemen" for $4.99 price should have tipped off noooo bought it stinks could had two pale ales on tap sank into trash
a screenplay that could have been better written by dung-beetle . cinematography below of high-school film project cast takes turns seeing who be least competent special effects the standards today are mediocre to poor all in , one most wretched films has ever disgraced industry
this is possibly the worst movie of 2003...even alleged great talent sean connery couldn't save it...a complete bomb that isn't even worth watching if someone gave it to you free.. .
why don't they both die . no more 80s reminents
what a waste of two the best monsters in recent cinematic history . guy who made this couldn't direct traffic
...as if the first two weren't enough .
what is this movie about ? it seems like they came up with stupid plot twists , to explain other .
amittyville meets 2001 . really a nifty idea too bad it failed miserably beyond the flashy and cool visual effect lies an incredibly poorly written badly put together peice of sci-fi rubish great premise is waisted on cute cliche teeny bop horror ploys that are so predictable even unbore fetus could detect them this film does however in early moments give off very creepy undertone keeps you hooked to movie hope throughout all crap something genuinly scary original will pop out blow away which unfortunatly never comes disapointing worth missing music though
a shallow plot with an unrealistic backstory . i am sorry but have to rate this movie as terrible expected be better sadly was dissapointed essencially , all that happened everyone went insane and killed each other it's called acid guys try it some time
don't waste your time.. . this is a really bad movie
pointless . senseless plotless thrill-less
completely pointless and tasteless . i didn't see the point in any money being spent to make that film yuck never it save yourself some what heck was chick? ! she kind of devil-angel person ? also , last scene where johnny depp is with her highly unecessary for ugh.. just can't express how incredibly stupid this movie
absolutely a brain-dead movie....who wrote this thing?....get out the tar and feathers .
senseless garbage . poorly written and put together not funny in the least bit
ignorant , implausible even by sci-fi movie standards . duchovney proves that he couldn't perform calisthenics much less as an actor
tasteless , boring and unfunny parody on sci-fi films . moore proves to be the only one strong do anything with this film because everyone else seems worn out gives off no energy noticed
boring , with cheesy effects and a annoying robot .
boloney............ .
this movie cannot be helped . the thin plot and poorly crafted sets are only beginning gary busey doesn't portray someone with any depth , while russel tries to properly his character supporting roles scenes without merit story is undeveloped as characters goes nowhere film's special effects definitly below average low budget shows through in every scene i would ask kurt russell if he read script before making or they just a good heap of money at him even beneath abilities an actor
blech ! and i'm not saying that because of the gore . this movie was absolutely horrendous nothing believable it looked like something from mystery science theatre 3000 acting awful special effects were cheesy story stupid everything
for the love of god , don't waste your money on this crap !
why ?
painful to watch . catwoman & hellboy the one two punch of "b" rated superheor flicks
worst movie ever !
boring movie
i'm sure ripping off 2001 and mission to mars was no easy task , but these people did it.. . wasted their time because this movie sucked an excellent only half as bad combining them a travesty i hope career wrecking
boring , brutal....what happened to this train wreck .
more will smith drivel .
that's nonsense
loses what little charm the first movie in series had .
it's just the same as first one .
a disgusting , incomprehensible piece of codswallop . not fit for reptiles even though the star is reptile (or something like one anyway)
basically we have "the exorcist" meets "rosemary's baby" . if you enjoy special effects at the expense of character development and plot , by all means - indulge yourself personally i found this about as interesting a trip through meat packing plant on golf cart going 120 miles per i'm paging comic book gospels according to mentally deranged but won't go there since isn't enough space page cover pathetic use abuse theology i'll just sum up saying ; not funny frightening near sited ill informed very dumb hand it reeves though he apparently stays top acting game get first choice high budget glitz wherein his only requirement is storm around like male model with an inflamed hemorrhoid spouting what might pass witty one liners provided are still in school would appear that formula throw camouflage anyone can look actor sadly for reasons no longer remember gave him bit more credit than until now
i want 90 minutes of my life back . 
come on now ! puuuuleeeze
i only watched the first half hour- was forced to turn it off for being so bad . has too many holes , action is stupid its unrealistic and camera motion often just a black picture where you can't even see anything stay away
please don't waste your time and money on this hollywood piece of junk . aside from 'battelfield earth' , 'mission to mars' is one the most boring tepid movies i've had misfortune viewing really has run out ideas.....special effects alone does not make a great movie !
this was a dumb ass movie . it completely sucked i didn't watch the whole thing and that dude is pretty weird looking !
this movie is entirely without merit . i am a scifi fan , but was beyond saving almost at the beginning when caught glipst of tim robbins' futuristic car get enough jerry o'connell on channel don't need any more in because he always leads me to ask : it possible act less ? one must have looked good paper feelings and emotions characters are not well conveyed through screen nor concept believable amazed that so many recognizable names signed terd
yo bump this movie!!!! !
boooooring.... .
this movie definitely has a thrown-together feel to it . shabby one at that apparently it's people were racing with the makers of red planet get theirs out first but kinda sucked too
one of the top ten worst movies i've ever seen . great cast , but no chemistry between them just completely ridiculous
this had to be one of the worst movies that i have ever sat through...i think real old lost in space television shows were better than this...how can someone like tim robbins (shawshank redemption) do a picture ?
incredibly horrible version of the classic h.g.wells story , with ludicrously bad performances from everyone . whatever happened to jeremy irons ? he used be a pretty good actor once upon time i'll tell you one thing i would never want have go up against that guy on old game show "make me laugh." decent but his career isn't merely going down toilet it's clogged in pipes
my rating is for the new version of time machine . original gets 5 stars from me simply a politically correct , diversity seeking stupid waste money whole theme novelette was ignored in favor knocking white people and praising anyone with brown skin why move setting london to york ? don't your this movie (even if you agree politics are wasting see instead)
this movie was horrible and boring . i would not recommend version of time machine to anyone don't bother renting the tape either , you'll just be wasting your money like most films made by hollywood today one showed their anti-white nature morlocks bad guys had blond hair mind control leader a glow-in-the-dark aryan who also according story mankind evolved into two species dark skinned mixed race were portrayed as completely good in creatures controller evil blonds ate people but never shown 'hero' flick killed all mutated aryans freed from oppression being food jewish misses chance portray negative manner h.g.wells hate his book since he well aware history (he wrote on subject) see take anti-aryan sentiments have inflamed him may described film an exciting way it really dull predictable even if you haven't read uses blow up then stays future is anti-technology saying took knowledge too far 'hero's' first couple jumps sees that (whites) destroyed moon causing society collapse left off 'good people' white 'bad' action parts mentioned very brief so go because narrative spoke basically nothing more than propaganda with little entertainment value no wonder tanked at box office rent will only it's movies do offer satisfaction guarantee
boy , did this suck . emilio estevez being chased by mick jagger on a moped is the stuff of nightmares preposterous waste time
lori petty , i hope this movie affected your career .
this is a bad movie , no question . in general consists of several men wanting to screw jane fonda who naked on and off throughout the some sort musical style science fiction if it possible for such thing exist i have not seen many things worse than piece manure find film be generally disgusting suppose you might want rent haven't but there are other women look better her
this film is so bad that i have to turn off the tv within first 5 minutes .
this is the worst 45 minutes i've ever seen . you might be wondering why i said ? well , it's because along with myself half theater left at that point there something not quite right about waiting in line longer to get your money back than do standing buy ticket
oh george...what were you thinking ? this film made no sense at all . where was the story again in set outer space , clooney finds that he has come contact with his deceased wife and to cope everything going on around him what i didn't understand is why want her back even though loved so much totally forced
this thing stinks on ice .
bored me soooooooo much . one of those films that you wind up almost falling asleep on a bunch times , and it's also ones for no good reason stupidly feel are somehow obligated to watch the whole thing then kicking your own ass wasting two precious hours this dreck
angelina jolie still sucks .
overrated stinkorama . some of the bad sci-fi movies mystery science theater 3000 makes fun was better than this snorefest supposedly , entire scenery and background computer animated if that's case then i praying for blue screen death to pop up get me out so utterly boring drab dull unimaginative even fx stunk planes looked plain dumb story like 9th rate film noir by rookie hack absolutely zero chemistry between jude law apple's mom used (especially in talented mister ripley) but his string stinkers (alfie closer detritus) him latest actor go shark jumping we may only remember as dude who stood next ashlee simpson when she complained about acid reflux on snl
utter garbage . if jude law's career can survive that it anything
this movie was basically a carbon copy of something from the early 50's . gwenyth paltrow's character as annoying she deceiptful and sky captain pretty much batman in plane
pretty damn bad .
so luminously dreadful it makes the first version look adequate .
dreadful , cheesy and corny "remake" of the original which was a minor classic whatever else it may have been pretty in its own right fairly unique influential landmark development sci- fi films . makeup indeed very good tim roth did job as usual but rest this movie atrocious plot particular abysmal
atrocious acting.stupid script.no amount of great special effects or hi-tech makeup jobs could salvage this heap dung.see the original!! !
the original planet of apes was pretty darn good!. . new one ( tim burton) , horrible ! do not waste your time on this trash i wasnt that impressed with ape costumes either especially female movie plot actors) itself is unwatchable shocked a human actually made crappy film
probably the worst movie i've ever seen !!! !
two hours of mark whalberg is bad enough . , acting in a movie that was just fine the first time around too much
heh , amazing...ly stupid . dont see this movie you watch it for an hour and a half uninterested the ending want to commit suicide becuase doesnt make any sense at all
the old version with charlton heston , roddy mcdowell surpassed this peace . it was horrible get real hollywood you cannot make best of those past into better you've proved piece
what happened to character development ? i found this film be an empty waste of my time . walberg was ok , bonham-carter great considering her beauty smothered by the silly monkey costume just didn't buy it seemed me that assumption made apes would follow path human but retain some their more hostile animal traits felt like got ripped off here guess one for shelling out 5.75 pitiful excuse a
this movie was horrible . they took out all the interesting and freaky parts that were in original seemed to be more interested fighting scenes chases than any of subtle first humans spoke english which i found weird mark wahlberg  .although may nice look at is a actor he not convincing .especially his uplifting speech ! save your money watch when it comes on tv again
embarrasingly bad .
shat
blah .
if only it had been the final movie as well .
could any of the people in this movie act ?
bad shatner ! no more writing anything ever
kirk meets god and it not impressed . you can tell that shatner directed it! ! a big pile of cack!
not a star trek fan- never liked it . it's so boring  the plot of
putrid movie that just stops , as opposed to ends . mediocre animation combined with a bizarre "live action" technique falls well short of adequacy
does this movie even deserve a comment ?
it's prob'ly been done , but hey - ohhhh the pain !
when i first read the list of cast members for this film based on old tv show , was very impressed by selection dr . smith however about five minutes in sadly came to realization ; even considerable talents gary oldman could not save hideously convoluted rendition that well-known 1960's as a matter fact if you watched back its original form only thing will seem mildly familiar here be names each character beyond forget trying relate anything else lost space once knew expect pace quick but goes - hitting warp speed from get go and never slowing down way too zippy non-stop action leaves little time left development or at times coherent dialog result is do care characters can't follow what supposed going it really made me wonder person responsible mess thinking movie tossed together apparently their goal throw just every popular sci-fi extravaganza hit screen since star wars  either they were actually confuse audience into believing story may have had some substance case didn't manage include enough also did capture light appealing quality originally
if you try to make a movie out of bad show , then what are trying accomplish?? ? nothing . and get this high-budget film that doesn't anywhere
very horrible movie ! could've been better .
this movie is real crappy man !
good movie idea gone bad . they had special effects that were great and the of an invisible man is something you could really run with creatively , but kevin bacon was just creepy elizabeth shue annoying english chick who's name i dont know whom surprised in her apartment a hottie though
this movie is awful from the start . it opens with a couple of scientists chasing down 500 pound , invisible gorilla without acting least bit concerned villian story crazed invisble and completely naked kevin bacon i mean what hell ! after sitting through whole thing can't figure out why was allowed to be made or called thriller
ugh ! the premise of this movie is compelling..the invisible man..blah blah . however , hollow man just doesn't cut it special effects are sometimes impressive but content (plot acting etc..) as kevin bacon plot lessens so does clothing on women in i guess they decided to rely gratuitous boob shots rather than put some actual thought into making will admit that there were (few) suspenseful moments..but about halfway through (if not sooner) becomes predictable and ending over top ridiculous don't waste your money or 2 hours life bomb
this movie is an insult to men everywhere . makes it seem like the only thing keeping a man from being rapist getting caught about who goes insane after invisible for three days in basement so he decides start killing his friends and co-workers wow ! great idea excuse show some boobs me want cry..
terrible , . it should be called shakin' bacon because is all about kevin ! and no way could elizabeth shue save her boyfriend by using a burning barrel
all flash , no substance . looks like the pervert wanted his set fantasies acted out in front of him and then decided to write a plot around scenes film could've been profound but instead it ws superficial poorly put together basically epitome trash that is churned by hollywood presently it's sickening
i didn't think this movie was very good because the ending ruined whole . special effects were but way that kevin bacon dies like three times isn't pleasing
hollow man bombed . the movie had great effects but story turned out to be very bad chick in was hot
you know , where do i begin with the pile of trash ? first all refuse to believe a tornado is powerful enough whip cow around 700 times but isn't throw truck they drive off road . oh and id swear plot this movie simply revolved knocking over tracking devices ! hellooooo there any intelligence left in hollywood?? love fact that comes clouds are black...yet not one drop freakin rain if see don't about i'm running opposite direction sure as hell aint going chase it down like these retarded idiots sucked
i found hollow man to be a very boring movie . went in the theater thinking it would scary and left disappointed only good thing about were special effects
what kind of plot was this ? besides predictability and a cliched storyline , the story went nowhere . fx did not save movie poor acting too
the special effects hardly make up for what movie lacked in plot . besides , it promotes animal cruelty (i overheard someone saying that sucked but coolest part was when a dog's head crashed against wall.. i bet they went home to try it.)
don't watch this movie , waste of money . rent all the good scenes are already in previews
angelina jolie still sucks .
what a dsiappointment . tomb raider was ripe to be blockbuster movie with built-in story line from the game this should have been generation's indiana jones series  , but they screwed it up bigtime !
badly written , poorly filmed dreadfully acted hogwash .
a horrible overrated movie that was popular for angelina jolie's looks and nothing else . the plot character development one of worst i'd ever seen
crap . even though this movie was supposedly action-packed , i completely bored with one the characters were absolutely retarded and directing infantile writer must have forgotten to include a story when writing script argh!! ! only thing that grabbed my attention angelina jolie's boobs bouncing up down she moved kudos for stupid guy who directed tomb raider wish there more blood but noooooo we keep pg-13 rating don't ?
an over-hyped piece of trash...no plot , corny dialouge and bad acting . lara croft wouldn't be such a poplular video game character if she didn't have gigantic boobs even my dad says that there's only two good reasons to see the movie ...i'll let you guess what are
i loath this film . what a waste of the talented miss angelina jolie and production costs they could have made twelve films size girl , interrupted with that budget there is no plot entertaining action sequences are interesting characters back stories parts where tried to add in comic relief but it came off as dull pointless chatter most dialouge was so mind numbing all hear were clicking sounds still one very attractive woman proves once again yes would like get hot heavy vixen beyond has nothing absolutly summer movie those usually ! never been bored an my entire friggin life funny part though beginning shower scene lara croft (which shows more skin than usual pg-13 fair) later on we think about be treated another when sudden pans down reveal...a man!! only laugh out loud guys oh yea!! then camera reveal square chin covered stubble receeeding hair line ahhh sh*t man great moment wonder if makers did intentionally ?
ugh .
allthough halle berry did her best-this movie didn't stick to the true story of catwoman batman comics . whomever wrote scrip was probbaly high on crack and screwed up everything !
i agree with 'the slacker'...and.. . there was way too much of halle's overrated ass and not nearly enough her acting in this movie but...oops...i forgot...she can't act
uhhhh...can we say bull**** on this site ? okay just incase my mind rants how badly movie sucked . ya'know , because the story line was and halle barry looked like after seeing it i felt for wasting 5 bucks
terrible ! halle berry what were you thinking ? the storyline is stupid , acting boring,and plot never takes off . no chemistry at all between benjamin bratt and oh that catwoman suit boots movie should be in comedy category  instead of action critics right on money this time
abominable version of the h.g . wells tale , markedly inferior to '77 with burt lancaster or one made in 30's off top my head i'd have say that this was brando's absolute worst film
do i smell something bad ? yes do.. . it's this movie
boring garbage featuring a worse than normal performance from stallone . (which is saying lot.) so dull it should have been called "judge fred."
ridiculously pathetic.two thumbs down .
the most incomprehensible movie i've ever seen . just awful
if we're talking about the first one with james caan made in '70s its probably worth 3 stars . more recent waste of celluloid , it barely deserves
home dentistry is more fun than this piece of crap .
garbage!! ! what in the hell was producers thinking!! horrible!!
one name--ll cool j-should tell you how good this film is .
godawful nonsense . jeremy irons seems hell bent on destroying his career and whatever scraps of dignity he once had
10 year olds could have come up with a better plot , and i got really sick of all the cgi shots exteriors buildings in main city .
only two things kept me watching . 1 jeremy irons ridiculously hammy acting 2 damodars blue lipstick(wtf?) the dwarf in this movie has to be lamest i've ever seen , it would have been awesome if gimli came into picture and decapitated him with his axe
oh my gawd , i can't believe payed to see this . did marvel comics give them their scrips or can none of act at all ? is so cheesy ! it's about the special effects but acting an embarrassment
what a waste ! the sfx looked good , but i wonder how did they persuade jeremy irons to do that....maybe got him drunk and gave contract sign . fell asleep after 15 minutes
i cannot even begin to tell you how incredibley dull and pathetic an attempt of film making this was .
bad in every way .
the damned being poor sods who sat through this , no doubt .
this deserves zero stars and three additional turkeys . now , i shall sheepishly admit that read a couple of the anne rice vampire potboilers to see what all hype was about therefore knew who lestat but since didn't book bow-wow is based upon totally lost go used video store once in while shop for bargain dvd's chestnut always cheapo bin should tell you something
starring hillary ?
one of the worst vampire movies ever . i can't think even good scene in whole mess pure hell all way thru...don't waste your time..
it bites , worse than a vampire with bad breathe .
bad acting , some woman replaced louis & took all his parts to make lestat look less gay didn't follow the book at laestat match character description one bit marius is not lestat's creator vampires are supposed be elegant beautiful skinhead stoners akasha's death sceen was really overdone .
they did not follow the plot of book , have all charracters from where hell was mekare real queen damned ? jesse and lestat nor will ever end up together . louie he supposed to be kissed by before went out on stage armand blonde is never in his everlasting life ! russian with long red-brown hair pandora died she still lives her existance hating loving what as lestat's mother gabriel should at least had a minor part movie this one worst i seen every copy burned
read the book , this movie is lacking entire story line it sucks . books are truly great
john "revolting" outdid himself here in trying to put some oomph his scientology beliefs . this film is really awful , but you should watch it at least part get the flavor of hilarious nature
godawful movie , perhaps the worst of its kind . it's absolutely terrible one saving grace is that unintentionally hilarious at times and yet those films where after a while you'll stop laughing how bad it depth much sucks will sink in
this is the most horrid pos i've ever witnessed in my life . i'll sum up it's stupidity one sentence cavemen flying 1000 year old harrier jets interested ? watch it to see how bad
awful . an amazingly talented cast is wasted completely in this poorly written piece of trash a film
johnny boy , what in the name of l.ron hubbard where you thinking ? he looks like a mutant hybrid rob zombie gene simmons and klingon this film .
astonishing . seldom has so much time , talent energy and money in such a triumphantly atrocious piece of dog excrement to be seen believed
after seeing this i thought to myself , really should have listened those critics . was one of the worst movies ever seen a thousand years slavery human race has forgotten everything that made them they didn't even know what triangle and yet managed learn how fly assemble nuclear device devise plan wipe out their enemies with planet makers crap had gall set up for sequel only part enjoyed when tavolta tried feeding guy rat
i've seen some bad movies in my time but this is the absolute lowest form of film ever made . if i see anything remotely close to being will murder it
wow ! i watched this movie because was curious to see if it's actually as terrible everyone says . and sure enough , shockingly bad i'm not which aspect of battlefield earth stunk the most - inane plot overdone acting ridiculous makeup/costumes or pathetic attempts create drama by showing slow-motion shots glass breaking every two minutes how did three otherwise respected actors (travolta forest whitaker barry pepper who great in saving private ryan ) get themselves involved such a worthless waste time money ?
how can anyone give this piece of crap more than one star . movie is terrible , we're talking plan nine from outerspace i admire travolta's misguided efforts to bring the works his demigogue life however book a bad and books only make movies assume that all actors with any name recognition were followers scientology reason why film was not locked into vault unbelievable nature cannot be denied no beyond age four could possibly held in disbelief for simple : gold most presious metal on planet let alone universe plot reality mistakes just get worse as goes do consider unde circumstances
horrible movie . bad , !
why ? did they make this movie what was going on in the filmmakers mind . i feel very sorry for myself not listening to my friends advice when warned me about seeing battlefield earth sucks no stars
what was travolta thinking ? barbarino in space . i kept falling asleep the first time so thought i'd better watch it again just as bad second some of fx were cool but not good enough remember panning for gold when a kid and getting those big bars , ! did terl give them smelting equipment no can't beleave anyone set out to make film this makes me wonder left on cutting room floor it's that rate wont let zero stars
i haven't read the book , but this was worst sci-fi movie have ever seen . even though special effects were pretty good story so bad that it's not worth going to movies for simply
john travolta keeps making this kind of movie and he will be back to playing vinny barbarino on welcome !
rutger hauer is a cyborg warrior who helps earth fight for its existence in an apocalyptic scenario . avoid at all costs !
this horrid , early 80's fantasy/ sci-fi flick that i think was a foreign film made in italy or something has to stand as one of the worst films genre . so bad it's almost watchable self tormenting sort way utterly dreadful but at least better than battlefield earth slightly reminiscent beastmaster twenty times worse and recall dennis miller's joke about hbo likely be on preview around clock circa 1983 if you can believe it
head for the bomb shelter , martha--they've dropped big stink !
hilariously awful fourth incarnation of the highlander series . plot (if it could be called that) is little more than a rushed , contrived and poorly acted segway to next action scene none which are very good an obviously strained effort cash in on tv same name
if i could rate this movie with negative stars , would . when heard about project was excited for months my favorite book to be made into a 2 part miniseries ! had such high hopes it great cast incredible potential the screencaps looked amazing (i will give that sets and costumes were bang on) even music good using 'the mystic's dream' by loreena mckennitt as theme however none of make up horrible butchering story seemingly entertainment's sake granted only saw last hours film but after have no intention ever seeing first won't spoil anyone whatever cracked out reason wants see viviane's death became mildly violent i'm actually getting fairly angry just remembering so i'll leave off saying don't watch at all especially (and can't stress enough) you're fan
so very , fake .
western movies r so boring
i love kungfu movies , and have to say jackie chan is particularly stupid . his buffonery reminds me of charlie chaplin 100 years ago wow he does own stunts hello thats because can't act oh wait a remarkable idea ! should get an acting double this movie like all sucks big time
jackie chan + western movie = pathetic i would give this no stars but it won't let me
this movie was totally gay . it another stupid ass plot for jackie chan i wish could kick his and get my money back
a so-so movie i cant see how it can be one of the best ever there are certainly many better movies that each actor in
worthless swill from jerry bruckheimer and michael bay . curse them for the garbage they throw in our faces when will it end ?
the only good thing i can say about it is special effects . otherwise don't know what was creepier-the weak story , gruesomeness or bad acting could've been a lot better-i think concept interesting but fell apart big time
this movie was disturbing . the effects were pretty good but that didn't make up for terrible plot
this movie sucked ! it was written and directed by very sick minds . i hope children don't watch can't imagine anyone wanting to see such a everyone who saw at the theatre agreed that should never have been made director stick fashion designing for himself writer be seeking professional help not allowed share dementia with world
towering imbecility .
lol...im going to have agree wth irishgit
unfortunately , the damn movie was still there after sixty seconds . it took over a hundred minutes for to leave
a very special kinda movie for person. . nuff said
will someone please stop banderas before he acts again! !
i would normally never have watched this movie , but was on a bus in mexico and it happened to be the in-route . long before over hoping one of those stories you hear about where collides with another or perhaps hurtles off cliff knew how oedipus felt when he blinded himself--and all had done is slept his mother ; sit through length absolutely worthless drivel passing itself as entertainment honestly don't understand why popular anyone other than most dedicated masochists
sucked sooo much - cannot believe humans actually (a)consider this entertainment (b) think cameron diaz is pretty (c) can act (d) paid money to see
do we have any bathroom freshener left , martha ? there's a powerful stink in here !
do i really have to explain why i'm giving this film one star , i'd give it none if could . is the biggest cash cow in prbably history of movies it's attempt after another at being slick and exciting fails both respects only bill murray worth what they paid him movie best scene : lucy lu as domanatrix/business woman
ok the actresses are very cheap looking in both movies!!! !
sucked
better name for this movie 3 woman acting dumb stupid , and air headed!! ! sucked!!!
question ? why do all these action movies want to have a fight sequence like the matrix
this is a terrible film . direction inept , everyone looks as though they are going through the motions cameron diaz shining light that burns bright in foul stench of donnot waste your money on unless you like films with inpenetrable dialogue risible directing and poor editing what was bill murray thinking????? ?
the movie had a good plot but acting from cameron diaz completely ruined story , it made me sick to watch her . strayed too far original charlies angels dissapointed
this is the worst movie i've seeing in my life . there no trama and just a bunch of airhead characters...aia guess it works if you miserable boring but not don't waste your time
good grief ! it's a zero re-make of the seventies flick that went out date in three boobs given superhuman capabilities to beat up on all bad guy's ? gimme break
this movie brings up two questions . since when does a tv show - which more than earned the description lame merit re-make 20 years after it was very wisely and thankfully cancelled ? have all creative writers died or did they just leave hollywood
i'm sorry for all cahrlie fans but i think the movie was terrible , a total waste of money and time !
ahh puke ! we got rid of this stupid show in the 70's and now they brought it back . only redeeming aspect is bill murray even he cannot outway lack plot stupidity idea drew barrymore , ohh i am near vomitting i'm not going to make bleechhh
bond movies ended when they ran out of books to base them on . brosnan is utterly unconvincing , the plot minimal and ludicrous casting belongs a bbc tv sitcom give up before devalue quality those made pre 1975
if i ever wanted to see such crap again id head straight a toilet
poop
as far i was concerned this movie didn't need to wait for another day die . it pretty much dead up ther on the screen
this movie sucks . worst bond ever made , well it beats casino royale but even avtak and nsna are better than dad
no way should this have beaten traffic for best movie .
ludicrous nonsense . somehow manages to be even stupider than the book it's based on
sucked - travolta at his worst , though i give the guy credit for so effectively milking one good comeback performance in pulp fiction damn long
boy , is this an awful movie ! i watched about 25 minutes of it and couldn't take any more . was extremely violent the plot difficult to follow john travolta just terrible in his role appalled by halle berry she should be ashamed herself for taking a part which her claim fame showing off breasts gratuitous nude scenes talk pathetic there absolutely nothing redeeming film- avoid at all costs
good god this movie is bad . everything about it so convoluted , the actions characters motives emotions and overall screenplay seemed oversimplified really forced unnatural i don't know why travolta keeps getting cast as villain he makes a effort but honestly he's not that at there are plenty of more convincing villains like keifer sutherland or gary sinise
the most god awful film i have seen in a long time . i'd rather see american pie 2 again and that is saying alot halle berry should keep her top on , yikes ! well for half mill probably whip it out what great idea an add campaign swordfish - starring berrie's unattractive saggin boobs wow fim makers waisted their money my do not this movie!!
how this film made so much money is a mystery to me . okay , the villain of piece is....a big storm...that everyone knows about...but our protagonists don't care...because thar be fish in dem dar waves george clooney and mark walberg are both talented actors but not even their skills can overcome corny dialogue story that may make for good reading makes excrutiating viewing
terrible movie . the book was incredibly bad poor job by geroge clooney under no circumstances would i suggest seeing this waste of time
it boggles the mind that vast majority of people posting ratings on this website rate worthless piece celluloid junk a 4 or better scale 1 to 5 . formulaic script and shockingly pedestrian direction (especially for director das boot) are bad enough , but dialogue is capper : clooney's last line in film (shouted at wave) one most laughable history i loved book translation terrible completely missing from very interesting way which storm's development was followed tracked by meteorologists instead creates false terribly underdeveloped story about weatherman who does nothing more than point computer screen say wow also lacking navy rescue divers (although found be somewhat distracting book) sum an excellent ended up being schizophrenic mess filled with insipid flaccid love stories drama drove real life event strongly recommend if you thinking person even really enjoys great bubble gum flick as do not waste buck renting garbage dollar night
i don't have much to say about the perfect storm because watched it for 30 minutes and then fell sound asleep . just couldn't get into characters were forgettable , took too long action kick in most of movie was shot shadows or dark which probably contributed my sleepiness husband whole thing though he said enjoyed i'll take his word it- there's no way i'd try watching again !
slow . not exciting at all some okay parts but the acting was very good and there never an climax
this movie was so long and boring . just a bunch of water swishing around i honestly can't stand boat movies wanted something spectacular miraculous to happen but they all died it major let down
stupid inferior remake of tony mann's great film the fall roman empire . forget gladiator , watch russell crowe is idiotic in this
they could have done so much better speculating the fate of 6 men that lost their lives in storm was subject this super charged over budget hollywood flick . problem is , focused on cheesy characters and action an insult to average educated human being's intelligence it exciting movie for a 12 year old likes good flicks sake no more less story line at one point i thought mark wahlberg george clooney were going kiss may rated two case
yuck .
waste of time . good thing i didnt pay for that movie only came out the was julianne moore , shes somthing to look at
this is the worst example of a violent movie i've ever watched ! i hate , think it's totally unnecessary silly only provoking society to do more crime . in hannibal they're eating human brain mass (even little boy!) slicing top madman's head so on how can be entertainment?? ? 'hughjackman's mate ' must very unintelligent man :-(
after just reading the book , i thought movie deleted too many essential characters and left out important facts that would have explained things in . seemed of kelter with several spots almost as if they had to put them but not order were overall plain sucked actress played clarice starling was horrible think joddie foster it her abilities been so much better entire like a clinical manual void emotion horror fuled first
before i saw hannibal knew that it would and could never live up to silence of the lambs . a few months film even opened , heard all a-list talents were behind this editor pietro scalia (good will hunting) screenwriter steven zaillian (schindler's list) david mamet (probably greatest modern american playwright) are part creative process you'd think movie at least be good sequel fantastic masterpiece then comes ridley scott who in my opinion is hot cold director he directed such great films like gladiator thelma louise blade runner but his resume also states g.i jane white squall 1492 : conquest paradise (need say more?) after seeing you really can't blame sir anthony hopkins or julianne moore for terrible love story masquerading as suspenseful cat-and-mouse game truly goes here so awful can see actors team trying their best make something out bad material since times screenplay delivers some witty reparte language lecter uses sometimes captures original's rhythm feel there moments with john mathieson's cinematography especially scenes italy hans zimmer's score one pacing was inconsistent chemistry between forced does her role doesn't belong looks freaky alright performance bit paint-by-numbers plenty holes unfilled plot too (why we know more about hannibal's past caretaker barney ? he's interesting guy ! if ten most wanted list fbi how did ever through airport security everyone using internet catch loaded information why hard find?) stupid example years has been capture our beloved cannibal takes two seconds three italian thugs knock him dump back van  taser gun oh final minutes ridiculous leave theatre laughing low filmmakers go gore brain eating scene just gives headache (literally) because it's contrived feels set audience squiggle squirm off corniest gags hollywood history wonder what jonathan demme original
if bad movies were a crime , ridley scott would get life imprisonment ! i'm mad as hell that this movie has made so much money in its first week and i wish there was way we could all our back! sir anthony hopkins an idiot for accepting the role... . he lost respect esteemed actor far im concerned jodie foster probably turned it down because she read script saw sucked!
this movie...it just plan old blew....i mean it was all hype...if you liked it...well your dumb....or are brain dead !
i anticipated this movie ever since heard they were gonna make it . biggest mistake of my life , was terrible huge disappointment ending the funny rather than scary
wicked is right , and i don't mean tht in a good way . this movie pure evil to have watch would rather turn my blockbuster card than risk accidently renting horrid excuse for action/dectective saw it once beleive me that was one time many
this is the worst movie i have seen in months . there were one or two almost entertaining moments , but those all shown on previews
this movie was so disappointing . first , it not believeable at all the sequence of events and characters reactions to were contrived also glorifies police brutality which is particularly disturbing as john singleton directed latinos are stereotyped drug lords in quite offensive
stupidest.movie.ever , the people who made this movie should have their balls chopped off and be thrown in ocean .
i'm just trying to move this movie off of the top 20
just awful..enough said
bad , really . i think 20 minutes was just close ups of bruce willis making faces blah
horrid epic with miscast bruce willis stuck in lamebrained , overblown action scenes . the screenplay could be greatest since adventures of pluto nash 
yet another execrable example of hollywood bastardising history . what is it with the us mainstream film industry that can't help re-writing to make come out winner everytime propaganda most sick making sort
um , i'm pretty sure the british stole enigma machine from germans not americans guess lads in continuity missed that fact
this is a disgrace to every british sailor that risked his life obtain the german enigma and its code book .
it was the brits who did all , americans were not involved . dont cry people no died here so of course one worth crying about i wonder if film had been made with english accents and subs called 'hms whatever' instead 'ss would this have ever even seen in us somehow think makes me sick claiming heroic deeds british as your own mentioning them at
dull , boring uninteresting uninspired unorigional complete bs . take your pick they're all true i got bored with this movie after nazis knives started jumping out of every corner one at a time only to get shot in the head was waiting for that tired old cliche` where black cat would jump hissing if you want good world war 2 film try saving private ryan or many other films about w.w.2
complete bull **** . american flag waving crap makes me puke this is a story based on the true heroics of britsih naval team , who went in without any protection by support why not tell everything usa americans were even involved when event took place.why does every thing out hollywood have to polish brass movies like patriot covered character mel gibson played was ruthless slave owner hunted his slaves for sport yet stuff gobbled up its candy please get grip reality
crappy movie
aweful . this movie's story was so insulting ! jet had some pretty sweet fight scenes , but if that is all i wanted to see would go down the local dojo you like blood and wwf-like drama movie for want something your ticket price then else
poop
this is just another pathetic rambo rip-off . please people , try to get a little original i have seen enough movies where 1 man outsmarts an entire army
this film is like a 2-hour long commercial of coca-cola and sports clothes .
never seen such a worse acting duo . gene hackman , king of cheeseball movies and owen wilson up coming couple fruits badddddd movie
crap
i hated this movie ! 15 minutes of action , bordom action.. . go for braveheart
this is where it all started . meg ryan the cheater! ! i have no respect for any person that can't keep her pant's up while she or he away from family!!
the only indication you get of two main characters having an affair is one lousy kiss . they hardly even talk about being involved or anything it's very dissapointing
i have never been so bored in all my life . talent used this movie was wasted the plot lacking , idea itself characters lacked gets off ground it seems to sit on its keyster and through out sperattic action hostage flick cliches but they are clever when do by boring you tears a little explosion or motorist getting blown bits machine gun fire is welcome happening even though adds nothing film advice stay far away
i have to give this movie a terrible rating because it re-enforces sterotypes and the storyline makes no sense unless point is that white men are more valuable than anyone else . all south american rebels portrayed as trigger happy druggies , which justifies slitting their throats setting up battle for gurrila group get slaughtered by army sponsered corporate intrests so main charactor's husband can be rescued
this film should have been subtitled no minorities were injured in the making of . movie almost brings up real issues (oil companies and dams corporate america) , but then quickly turns back to cheesy romance good guy/bad guy senario funny how bad is south american revolutionary rich white male somehow they manage blame it all on drugs obviously those only want hold people ransom attack oil project so can protect their cocaine crop make be okay go shoot if are saving a couple guys talk about cultural insensitivity racism simply enforced age-old stereotypes
sucked , an insult to those real vets . precision bombing in world war ii ? please planes dumped their bombs and ran people below be damned
go away pierce brosnan/
just another slutty james bond movie .
this is just about the worst bond movie ever . to say plot flimsy would be grossly overstate existence of a casting belongs on tv , or channel 4 low budget film - robert carlyle as bad guy ? i don't think so robbie coltrane and goldie (??????) nuff said only judi dench has screen quality but she comes across like your headmistress from school not boss bonds got worse when harry saltzman left (died?) still they ran out books base plots have hit an absolute nadir now cubby broccoli isn't involved give up another was shameful exploitation hide lack by having action sequence five minutes can't suspend disbelief any longer films started in 1962 which assuming he around 30 then makes him 70 also belong that era cold war threat actually did exist such russia goldfinger etc had some degree plausibility loons jonathan pryce sean bean do credibility modern post glasnost
pierce brosnan should stick to remmington steel because james bond was finished when sean connery . you are right , world is not enough for ....me poop on
this is a horrible movie . possibly the worst james bond ever acting by denise richards was deplorable , and corny jokes seem to have gotten worse in addition rich oil daughter lady supposed be prettiest girl world but she really isn't
for this movie to have such big time actors in it , sucked terribly !
john woo did better work when he made low budget flicks with unknown actors and actresses . the worst performance in this movie goes to bad guy , just isn't evil enough any good at being tom cruise much as a hero nowhere near first one best scene : i can't think of
crap
this is perhaps one of the worst action movies all time . first , it so removed from premise original mission : impossible series that people wouldn't even recognize as a sequel were not for title second plot predictable they come bad man wants to threaten world with virus and hero has stop him plus girl in danger ; give me break third there truckload slow-mo scenes might look good minutes but then become tiresome since amount them be seen believed fourth are over-the-top ridiculous hunt (cruise) can avoid bullets perform stunts exhaggerated utterly laughable fifth movie many holes absurdities completely irritating whenever infiltrate guys' team he wears mask impersonate anyone who never before or taller fatter whatever at point guys killed because makes wear himself just imagine was carrying ! how's deus ex machina what about transmitted through blood certain suddenly supposed airborne 'cause otherwise work ? pathetic sixth copies left right superior most pale imitation bond rest taken some hitchcock's classics superhero (yeah cruise also strong film could rival superman) ii summer i've ever my life should avoided like plague
i saw this at the cinema with my partner and his family for b'day during summer . we were not impressed there was only one piece of camerawork that particularly like cars it seems to me film doesn't even adhere original series therefore should have title appalling
im2 is poorly made and seems to mirror bond films in its need for action excitement . this film a mockery of the idea behind im there are no mind games or intrigue , rather very thin tranparent plot with huge budget big stars john woo's infamous trite directing abilities
just like part one , all special effects and tom's nose . nothing more & less.
i went into the movie expecting a fast paced action thriller with complicated , well thought out plot . was disappointed to be confronted boring corny love story it one of worst movies i've seen this year
this movie wasted my time . it overused the camouflage face mask routine totally demeaned black lead actress , and had no depth just technology
this movie is terrible because it re-does every old trick from the first . i was not surprised , and insulted by their pitiful portrayal of one only black women in a major role an action film long time
i'm still on planet earth right?!?! ? hello! ! people work with me here . where to begin , how 'bout i walked out of this film in the first half hour and demanded my money back couldn't believe what a parody was one didn't think fantastic but at least it stayed line type visuals acting suspense show thing just non-stop oh god is cheesey scene after another when he's rock climbing jumps 20 feet down his right slides face until he suddenly grips protrubing pebble?!! then decides turn himself around hang for couple minutes while stares off into space goddamn cool look or bathtub dance floor two cars doing 360 stuck together give break
sorry , i hated this film . it was very loud brutal violent and way too long the movie ended after an hour then 45 minutes later ran out of steam finally about three a half hours as roger ebert once said you can tell is bad when look at your watch again shake to see if it's stopped would go on historical inaccuracies... couldn't seem find time setting there were native americans doing martial arts wolf itself some kind giant [badly done] cgi badger with armor obscuring from seeing (when do they use standard hiding monster bit for most film) had say anything photography settings costumes beautiful but only validate know plot chaarcters are lacking completely surprised expected sensible well-done french what got nonsensical american-style blockbuster
jet li cant fight . hes a bum
it could've been good , but ended up being a piece of crap .
this movie sucks . no plot , talent fun action is lame ! with a capital l aaliyah needs to stick her singing and jet li find better script because he can fight just isn't convincing actor the way scatter brained really makes point keep viewer interested only redeeming quality of are shots that show an x-ray damage as it being caused hardlly up for such waist time money on both studios part consumers
confusing and boring action film makes little use of it's two leads , doesn't offer anything exciting . just another excuse to bring a talented performer into despite the horrid material he may have work with avoid at all costs
this movie sucked!!! ! pretty boys do not make a good .
i liked it better the first time saw , when was called brave heart . there were so many events in this movie that a total copy of bh got to point knew what going happen 20 minutes before even on screen.. rip off
awful , what an insult to those men who died there . nice hair josh hey guy it was 1941 you were in the military - quasi-homosexual beatle cuts and sideburns not order of day
overrated .
i really wanted to give an extra * for the bombing and battle scenes,but just can't.that american flag sinking is not a metaphore me it terrible clichee.and ok,if you are woman,the lead actors may be quite appealing,but hey,you can always use tabloids that.it amazing what great do buck (or lot of bucks).i mean , alec baldwin should ashamed accepting such trash.as dialogue:god help german army if there more like where came from-says british squadroom leader affleck's character.jesus,what was screenwriter thinking?!it that kind lame dialogue ruin everything in movie.as story...at one time scream:why dont two share bimbo get over with!love triangle my foot!too bad actors,but have say find something annoying about ben affleck no matter he does .
this is a just romance chick flick pretending to be war movie . highly historically inacurate long and boring could have cropped half the romantic scenes , still would failed much better about attack tora
a maudlin and simplistic love story during which the japanese happen to bomb pearl harbour . prettily filmed though
an appalling piece of garbage , which i had mercifully forgotten until saw it listed here . one watching gets the impression that pearl harbor was some kind spectacular american victory due to heroics a few ace fighter pilots no such thing and also from movie doolittle raid success ravaged japan's industrial machine : caused very little damage at all (mainly being psychological victory) special effects in are good as they always but acting is laughable contrived romantic parts make any watcher with high standards reach for vomit-pan avoid this deformed turkey there plenty better movies
this movie made a mockery out of one the darkest days in american history . according to plot being stationed at pearl was big funfest nurses running around dressed there casual clothes flirting with every non comm they see.officers funning it up on beach , loads free time be had by all.they make prelude war seem fun and romantic if is way our military system operates i'll reinlist tommorow now i know that hollywood takes libertys facts but went hand.if your going about habor then do so show us unknowns day not some stupid love story holds no bearing all dealings dec 7 1941 will live infamy picture people soon forget
dude , the japanese are bombing us and stuff!that's not cool at all ! save for excellent attack scenes this mega-bomb of a film is simply wretched . i'm sorry ben you cannot act grimacing universal emotion politically correct re-telling pearl harbor any more offensive considering 11 september what waste
have you ever seen such decent special effects ruined by awful acting ? don't make a historical film if are going to turn it into cheesy romance .  .doesn't hollywood more respect for old veterans typical shlock- overhyped , overdone overacted real dissapointment
newsflash -- the exact same subject has been with just as well , if not better in at least a dozen other movies . sure fx are nice but whatdehay is point when acting and surrounding plot so insipid ?
my last review of this film was so offensive that they couldn't post it . sick testament to racist american values left me feeling and cynical as nearly provoke violence in otherwise pacifist spirit is the worst i have ever seen , after phantasm 2 countless other sequels horror schlockfests exploitation films  insulted soul its paen romance a farce itself with such flat dialogue cannot even remember quote it.. female lead miss beckinsale has managed feign likability eben face her despicably empty foray into quick sex public something know viciously but act romanticized ! cinematography unnecessarily sexy setting alone are ridiculous when mr hartnett inevitably lays down his war-mongering life for good old usa moved laughter constant stream racial slurs delivered by our heroic boys evocative wonderfully propagandist flicks war era their stupid patriotism insult anyone who laid any country perfect antithesis arlington national cemetary saving private ryan young innocent dead never felt guiltier nationality not standing at smithsonian looking tribute japanese oppressed people internment camps during ww2 whose plight caused those fools share morale professed sad reading conditions slaves oppression enforced former presidents ill wish death touching conclusion's little boy vietnam being brought up vein dear daddies doubtless become one crouching slurring monuments blind racism running through grass an automatic weapon desire blood unseen foe certainly enjoying kill 'em all glory fathers managed.. he blown apart mine wonder what affleck's character would do.. erect monument heroism war-loving void will result philandering impressionable girls eerily reminiscent modern sentiment toward afghanis.. it's okay hate kids kill.. okay.. most insulting vapid vile realm experience blasphemy cruelty madness publicity bloated painted devil-whore
i can't explain how desperately wanted to walk out on the movie . it might've been better if they'd had a script of some sort and ending was so disgusting laughable felt like hurting someone after sitting through this nauseating melodramatic garbage
do movies reflect the personalities of people who make them ? if so , michael bay (director) and jerry bruckheimer (producer) must have no at all . characters are only self interested shallow while actual bombing pearl harbor seemed like it's purpose was to mess up that little love triangle between three in movie what a bunch saps
i saw this movie with my mother-in-law . can't remember laughing so hard at a it is bad , predictable cliche filled that you have to laugh piece of trash the battle scenes save was apparently made for 12 year old female crowd
i had been wanting to see this film since the previews started four years or so ago (slight exageration) and by goly if wasn't disapointed as a small child who receives kid rock c.d . for christmas what waste of time don't give damn about stupid love story ! that isn't pearl harbor was care history not friggin triangle thing wanted mellow drama bull sh*t would have gone seen here on earth some other teeny bopper crap movie with in it side plots like no porpous could very fine war america one its greatest loses most horrible disasters should titled harbor's all sleepless is travesty am ashamed ever going peice trash complete poo
i snuck into this when was 11 or so .  .(it one of the first pg-13 movies) and it insulted my intelligence then a bunch high school brats outsmart communist soldiers guerrillas ? you've got to be kidding me excuse for howling that teeny-bopper yells wolverines!!!! !
massive disapointment . i am a huge fan of james patterson the author all alex cross detective novels and must say in respect to novel , this film is travesty nothing like biik which retrospect much more enjoyable well thought out movie follows book no way except that good guy bad gary sonja grows into you end up feeling for any character at when ah ha moments fail make go sighn failure kiss girls wasn't better anyway recommend reading books stay away from or other made brilliant series
worst movie i've ever seen . totally guy stupid unrealistic fighting!! ! terrible is an understatement
tomorrow never dies is one movie that should run to the grave and die , because it's not good at all . pierce brosnan quit job he stinks as james bond can't fight way roger moore did or get ladies like george lazenby
this has distinction of being the only movie to cause me fall asleep in theater . skip it and rent an older bond flick
only slightly better than austin powers . but james bond is still a slut
why do i keep watching them anymore when know they'll be pants
i tire of these exercises in trying to look as cool possible . this movie has no backbone and seems like it was just throw together order get some poster shots gratuitous nudity not that there's anything wrong with gratutious but nothing about film is done any hint style rob coen needs direct porn films , i'm sure his would make more sense field best scene : the
didn't get through the first 20 m's of it . boring !
i can't believe this is even on here . one of the worst movies all time terrible acting , ugly cars
after that dumb movie came out all these riceburner 4 bangers started buzzing up and down the street with their in reality slow cars zigging n of traffic . only good car was charger they trashed it.american v8s are a lot cheaper faster right off bat ask any mechanic.its just trend making lots people escepially girls dont know anything about will flock to it shiny head taillights(not but alot) its really stupid though things say not factual at second one is probly going be dumber except for camaro which i hope trash havent seen yet so miracles can happen
imagine watching a drag car race for 90 minutes . the film has an ok premise , but is 89 too long interesting performance by newcomer vin diesel he even seems wasted
this movie was a waste of time to me . it so boring that i couldn't pay attention the do not rent unless you want money go down drain
point break with cars instead of surfboards and bad . the acting may have been good if actors would had something to work , but as it was best couldn't saved this movie unfinished plot lines that weren't very begin lame longest 1/4 mile races i've ever seen
it was a chore just to sit through this movie . the whole premise of having lug nitro glycerine up k2 jsut seems bit too ridiculous for my tastes apparently these people really needed get new containers stuff because ones they had leaked like nobody's business good grief best scene : there isn't one
american can not make a good disater movie anymore .
what in the hell is bobbybo thinking ! action all i can say about this movie but was it edge of your seat ? no acting good hope they stop making day come out with on tape!! aaaahhhhh crap
this movie was so bad , even i can't believe it . the designed to throw every possible exciting event at you one after another until are thrilled out of your pants instead just overkill like fantasy as much next person but fake and silly felt insulted don't know first thing about mountain climbing or bombs helicopters am intelligent enough that 1) there's no way a billionaire could get many people show up party on k2 where did all cute chicks come from ? give me break climbers partying drinking beer why aren't they resting for tomorrow's hike puh-leeze 2) pakistani government would have allowed team renegade rescuers tote leaky cartridges explosives some also if going blow someone hole in had better crack precision experts do rather than sending down note saying bang warning survived blast 3) see how helicopter hovered long allow rescue group jump off without crashing that's tip iceberg far ludicrosity goes anyone who rated above 2 should be ashamed producers directors actors (chris o'donnell thought higher this!) studios keep putting garbage yes want action drama please makes least little sense insult my intelligence hero can washed-up guilt-ridden dude is carbon copy other ever seen (gee bet writers watched cliffhanger while were thinking ideas ! it's same freakin' story!) ended having buy boyfriend dinner because dragged him lousy he mad an hour over time gets pick what we
wit the hell is this film i've never heard of it
long and dull . they were on a nuclear submarine but didn't bother to bring radiation suits that's real smart the endless bickering between harrison liam was annoying at times
war movies usually suck .
booorrrrinnnnnggggg ! it's hard to make a war movie that is not at least little exciting but they did it with this one . i know all guns blazing and people being dismembered its lot of sitting around sleeping , eating checking equipment the said no wants watch afore mentioned
can a war film be confusing , boring and pretentious ? yes it !
pretentious , self-indulgent claptrap . beautifully photographed it is like a prettily wrapped turd under the christmas tree
this movie will no doubt disappoint those who expect epic battle scenes and nonstop action - is not that type of world war ii . fact , however does necessarily make it bad what makes the pseudo-intellectual feel virtually drips off screen i really a lot people saw despite its awfulness believe saying they like sign an intellectual desperately tries to be poetic filled with meaning but results dull contrived utterly void spirit
the worst movie i have ever seen ! usually like ww2 movies but this was missing everything
by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life ! had to wake boyfriend up so we could leave . half movie theater walked out , never that happen before
dismal , preachy garbage .
this not only was one of the most boring military-type movies all time , it also inaccurate . after watching movie i am still sure what type unit they were supposedly playing anyone that could stay awake for see shocking ending from a mile away entire set takes place in panama with some elite quasi-ranger doing training samuel l jackson is senior non-commissioned officer though he wearing specialist rank few scenes plot extremely corny and sloppy pretty weak character development thing look these types at least accuracy...but know there are no women units like (score : political correctness 1 - accuracy 0) usually train together dress same uniform would compare to predator had schwartzaneggar or any other good actors much less action think biggest let-down be where shock awe really wants make you say yourself so ? case please save $10 don't watch
the rating says enough
as bad leathal weapon 1 / 2 3... . dont know how they get away with making such crappy movies......
josh hartnett delivers a fun performance in this putrid , unfunny god-awful comedy  . ford is so mis-cast and wasted here
embarrassing , vapid garbage with arnold fighting against a cloning conspiracy . i kept hoping he would die so this turkey end the acting is excremental and script belongs in bird cage
i must admit , im a huge arnold fan predator and total recall have to be 2 of the best action movies ever made ( course greatest sci fi film ) . but folks dont see this it is disapointment he knows may got thumbs up they were their asses at time...dont bother with one
worst movie ever . not a shred of complexity , even with two dumb bodybuilding leads
this movie could have done so much with its theme instead it just was the biggest let down - and i am an arnold schartzeneger fan . hated everything about , though believe cloning is possible went all in wrong way
worst movie i've endured in a l o n g time whew . talk about mangled attempt at rewriting the old rehash from total recall what monumental waste of and money to produce this garbage nothing makes remotely any sense whatsover arnold looks bored stiff , no other actor adds anything worth watching fx are cold lifeless just like horrid script people around me were making 'lots bathroom trips' hoping doubt turkey would some point get better it never did is one those rare bombs where you wish had your ticket back ! -----todd michael wiseman ohio univ college film cinematograpy
horrible ! this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life . who were idiots came up with story for one ? characters are so weak , nobody can possibly give a damn about them so-called plot is setting never changes and there only action scene whole would've fallen asleep if didn't some booty next to me keanu or whatever his name absolutely sucks no skills talent what's movies nowadays being either too short long when go want see solid two-hour that doesn't waste time an hour half honestly been happier throwing on myself wiping it hands even remotely similar comes out again somebody hollywood gonna catch beat down
poop
it seems times not the only thing this film ran out of
one word terrible . first , i don't much care for most snipes flicks they tend to all be about the same and always predictable he plays character there are a few that ok but this isn't of them special effects were bad could tell budget was spent on because cars blew up old off by themselves where shots easy control avoid film if you can
crap
i thought nothing would beat armageddon in stupidity . but was wrong just watch this and you'll see for yourself actually don't dont think studios should get any $ releasing crap
ugh . you'd think that samuel l would have made a difference in this movie at least , that's what i thought the only reason didn't ask for my $10 back when show ended is got to see rammstein beginning of (i'd pay any day till on big screen) and villian was mildly cool otherwise trash
samuel l jackson : an excellent top-notch performer who wows audiences everywhere . too bad he went so low by performing in this flick just used to get teens come and see the wasted vin diesel good action scenes few far between...usually there are none
lame !
you see this and your very stupid worse movie ever!! !
vin disel makes an effort in this awful action thriller , that looks almost like a tv film . man apart tells the story of who loses his wife during shootout and then decides to take revenge on killers drags for about one hour too long scenes are overdone is good but skills hardly anything special
jackie ,  . what on earth were you thinking!? ! he opted not to do his own stunts for this one and it was a huge disappointment many chan fans storyline lame but i wasn't expecting oscar material or anything jennifer love hewitt just convincing as scientist almost painful watch if there are any out who hasn't seen highly suggest that spare yourself the pain
it takes way too long for the adventure to begin .
there are several movies i am sorry ever got made , and this is one of them . so wasted my hard earned cash on such a rotten movie but could expect from anything starring the worst actors to disgrace screen kelsey grammer ? even robert de niro whose mere presense usually says good couldn't help trash dumb plot
did not like this movie at all . it's a waste of time
this movie has an amazing actor robert denero to help build its hype . but even though the concept was good acting and scenes of violence ruined
why must hollywood do this to the man that played vito corleone and jake la motta ?
bad , and . you pitt fans are better off staring at a poster julia roberts need therapy anyway
very bad .
yikes , i'm amazed at what people find enjoyable . i felt like standing up and asking the entire crowd 'how can you think this is good?' story line was so idiotic ! save yourself some time get a poster of brad julia stare it for 90 minutes you'll be better off
wastes alot of talent . bad plot samuel l jackson will act in anything
badbadbadbadbad... . bad dialogue plot acting action not funny even (no , i am some english patient loving snob-i like movies - but this one blows)
wow - this movie proves that people do not know what type of they are making when it . much like opening a present , see for the first time is done and opens unfortunately large box doggy doo i don't usually diss other reviewers but those rating highly must be on costner's payroll in one actors families or mental facility
this movie sucked . i laughed (at the stupid acting , storyline casting and action scenes.) cried (because damn just would never end.) fell asleep (for obvious aformentioned reasons.) saw on prom night with all of my friends maybe because we were too busy making fun it really missed whole point..but doubt
this movie was horrible . tcb , man...takin' care of bul**hit in a flash kevin costner atrocious(even for him) the writing abysmal russel kind looked like he'd rather be anywhere else than on set awful
this actually made my hair hurt ! invest your ticket money in budweiser and listen to the frogs .
never saw it but raiders of the lost ark should be number 1 .
i hate martin lawrence . his comedy , movies and the fact that he even has a career
who was the target audience for this , half-witted security guards ? i can't see anyone else thinking it amusing .
martin lawrence and steven zahn have chemistry , but this unfunny painful comedy is a real disaster .
just an action movie to showcase the onscreen partnership of ice cube and mike epps . not very good at all
one lame movie !
uuuuuuugggghhhhhh ! this movie was the most irresponsible , unwatchable sorry excuse of a that ever i mean created . there very little resemblence real nascar race or team in it is worst about tom cruise wooden rest cast could barely hold their own script unbelievable for any fan action sequences were filmed during an actual running daytona 500 entire highlight everything else drivel
almost a precursor for "the ghost whisperer" , not as bad the commercials led me to believe . halle berry plays clinical psychologist who is wrongly imprisoned murder she didn't commit and has escape clear her good(and sexy) name
it had potential . great actors , story and plot they didn't use all of that to the best their abilities let fall very weak disappointing at
next version...rambo takes on the grim reaper , and triumphs in name of good ol' red white blue ! seriously though i've heard stallone is contemplating another version this pablum . when will guy go away ? hasn't he made enough money already
driven...to the eject button .
yep , i concur - this was that bad . is stallone bankrupt yet ? someone please take him to the action hero retirement home and tell staff they can't make eye contact with him..
one of the worst movies ever made
dont ever expect a film written by stallone and directed renny harlin to be anything of even slight interest . i enjoyed this movie the way battlefield earth , bad performances surrounded mindlessly confusing direction equates roughly poop on stick
best career move for vin diesal ; not being in a pointless sequel . thge cars took center stage as usual because the plot was horrible when you have movie with ludicris and tyrese , what would expect ?
i bet they got pretty deep into production of this movie before a intelligent passerby observed that "faster and furiouser" might not be the best name for sequel .
two much garbage .
i somewhat enjoyed the first one , but this was a total waste and an obvious attempt to capitalize on surprising success of film . never thought i'd say it probably would've been more tolerable with vin diesel in
who actually liked this movie . oh wait , people that own stupid slow ricer civics
fake propaganda . they make economy cars look like their freaking lamborghini's how many domestic vehicles were in this movie compared to the import number ? interesting i wonder much car companies paid thier really fast
with diesel , this film is a real turkey .
i thought it would be good but instead was plain old horrible .
what's next , ocean's thirteen fourteen etc. ? if you keep adding turkeys maybe can drive the ocean series into negative ratings .
terribly boring , the first one was good and of course i thought this wood be . it just keep dragging out on on...and don't see movie unless you have a severe case insomnia really need sleep
i don't know why she gets roles when produces efforts like this . the movie could've been saved if were about caveziel's character
couldn't get through the first 5 m's of it ! boring
there were a couple of moments where i thought the film could rebound and turn out to be halfway decent , but was certainly wrong . really don't see how it classifies as an action flick begin with would better suited under drama (rated at bottom list course) plot hard follow it's quite questionable whether actually one sappy love story no is never good thing makes for
no chemistry between the actors , confusing plot an ending that made sense . i left wondering what whole thing was about feeling like ripped off
should have been called mouseketeer . what a disappointment
sucks
only holywood can ruin a classic like that .
gave it 10 minutes that is all i needed!! ! don't bother!! didn't need to see anymore be able tell sucked
i like both jolie and banderas (see in the 13th warrior!) , but not this movie ! while film lamely tries to show a destructive relationship plot line is so preposterous that it does disservice these budding stars . for your wallet's own good skip turkey
yea , this movie sucks . directed by the same fool who got jolie naked for disastorous hbo film gia comes a new travisty which flonts talents of an incredible actress and sheds her clothes yeah was bad but one star above tomb raider!! !
these snake films are really bad . the snakes in this film get beefed up by chomping on blood orchid supposedly took place borneo anacondas found south america , not ! martha made me go to shame her
l...o...l ! from now on , the title anaconda can only preceed a porno flick . these movies are terrible
a friend and i got together hacked this movie to absolute pieces . anyone over 12 years old that thinks film was worth 10 cents is delirious an embarrassment poor effort detail on the director's part way , out there far fetched ! hand-to-hand combat while aboard motorcycle going 100 mph come now acting almost hilarious at times even though not supposed be comedy just waste of time -1 star would gift for nonsense
it was really confusing and boring ! the best bit when heath ledger had a metal bucket on his head
utter crap . i've seen better wrasslin' promos
wretched .
i hate steven seagal movies . he is a lousy actor with no personality
awful acting , terrible scene writing weak script and to top it off a snake that looked like something i'd find in my garbage disposal . movie
boring and tiresome . show me to the door
the snake should have done us all a favour and eaten director writer .
this garbage makes you root for the snake . another j lo piece of art
one of the worst movies in history humanity .
give me a break , the producer director and all actors including rubber snake should be banned from making movies for 50 years . they dont come any worse than this....
if you really want to see a movie about giant snake that goes around killing people , well first of all why would ? second this isn't the one . bad effects characters don't care whether they get eaten etc
bad movie , horrible plot . dmx is one of the cases for why rappers shouldn't attempt to act jet li didn't do some wire stuff like in "romeo must die" just a horribly conceived and carried out
how does dmx keep getting these roles ?
jet li stinks .
how is this getting 2 stars! ? movies like are why there should be a zero rating on site ! what the hell was that , exactly jet li fire your agent now!! dmx... . well good for you got in another movie now go away
horrid action film with terrible performances and boring scenes . avoid at all costs
one of the worst sequels done
i only saw 'speed 2 : cruise control' once . never have been more disappointed at a sequel reviewer harold-insane said it right what happened ? well , three words to describe this blows chunks !
two words , what happened ?
rip off of a japanese animation kimba the white lion
it pisses my ass off .
beauty and the beast is one of a movie . it starts out really , good but after musical numbers 5 minutes have gone by you are wondering what heck we doing now...talking to teapots candlesticks ?
this was a really annoying movie *just spoonful of sugar* ugh .
awful !
a surprisingly dull movie with cheesy special effects , story line dumb songs . i enjoyed the roald dahl's book but for some reason hated this not even gene wilder could save one ! let's hope new johny deep is way better
yes
this is the worst movie ever stroy dull and boring summing it up was stupid !
whistle while you work ? how effin cheesy !
highly predictable . added nothing to the genre of screen animation tired old story with , uninteresting characters even donkey couldn't make this piece cinamatic tripe worth money
man , do i hate this movie . okay so it was a little funny but the story and voices were complete crap
this is a boring , stupid  and easily predictible movie . probably the worst i have ever seen
good actors with a bad movie .
for some reason i just didn't like this movie . it seems has too much adult humor mean , does a kid's really have to be laced with enough require pg rating ? because the parents want entertained while taking kids if entertainment themselves hire baby sitter and go out see bridget jones diary but don't fill america's youth foul even is 'sugarcoated' shrek was dissapointment say least one good thing about i'm believer remake again that's our own enjoyment young child care smashmouth or 'rock song' as their theme song would hope that answer in jaded world still no
i really thought all the originality and humor from original was gone . story basicly averege because it just had alot of old shrek in but with a meet parents storyline which is very prdictable villians comical sidekicks are dull since they have nothing funny to say only things coming voice actors instead script even movie/pop refrences seemed out place ! see
both shrek's are way overrated , of all the pixar movies or whatever out there  this one is worst . shrek annoying donkey dumb cliche parodies
i just want to know if the people that rated this movie good or great actually saw . because you have relize is quite horiible true , it does take new steps in animation but would say extremely boring
chicken run is a terrible clay-animated feature with the voices of mel gibson and miranda richardson . this movie for chickens
horrendous dialogue and poorly crafted antagonists ; one of those occasions where the style-over-substance is a bad thing .
horrible remake of a kids cartoon that needed no such treatment . it expanded the 'grinch' universe just speaks to arrogance hollywood notion they could do something like this is appaulling did not need doing either jim carrey plays him ok , but what should have been learn from their mistakes and things twenty-two minutes right for dr seuss classic
wow , i am really in a minority here ! but don't care . feel this needs to be said film was trash got it for christmas and only watched once nothing at all like the cartoon can't believe they consider children's movie scenes of grinch eating top off beer bottle come on! there is no way can justify anyone allowing small child watch as far concerned hollywood has again butchered classic
they don't make kids films like used to , thank god ! this was a stunning film . stunningly and mind-numbingly bad excellent plot were mere child finds book wrecks an entire movie the key force of destruction in is nothing which about all trach
bambi is just plain , one of the worst disney movies ever made . it so stupid and whole entire plot with a talking deer it's go shoot burn video box
why the hell is this in horror section
fantasia is a movie that will bore your child to death . there are no spoken words in it , but just some terrible lousy music bunch of fat guys you introduced the beginning playing
what i have to say will not earn a helpful rating from anyone , but i'll it anyway : this movie was corny in places stupid other and had violence . couldn't find anything like about
the fact that airplane's robert hayes attracted me to rent this movie . i in learned a good lesson , movies show singing nuns are way better then watching cat drown
the worst harry potter film yet . they skipped way too much of book leaving loads if flaws i also didn't like how this director changed hogwarts so it looked nothing first two i'm hope globet fire will be a huge improvement !
with respect to ford and connery , this movie is a worthless abortion . the effects are cheesy timing off plot's not so scary degeneration of serious fluffy that must befall any remarkable franchise or trend as it gains popularity settles into routines seems especially pronounced in threquel has some funny silly moments which welldone but if i had do over i'd just burn seven dollars watch t.v for two hours
roald dahl has written some great books , that were all turned into movies . first there was willy wonka a pure classic then james and the giant peach movie now comes matilda piece of trash i hated girl in this she is so annoying such weasel
i was very disappointed that the film did not follow book , it lost roald dahl's magic touch same with witches .
i remember when watched this at school the kids made fun of scene where two main character sleep together . sadly think it's amusing since film is mostly a snore
very stupid and boring movie !
shockingly depressing and downbeat for a children's tale , this overrated pseudo-classic has crude animation uninspired voice acting little humor present .
th most idiotic excuse for a movie i've seen in while and some bad movies .
note to hollywood : never bill celebrities on a theatre poster when they're only in the film for 5 minutes . sigourney weaver , jon voight and patricia arquette star this children's bore based hit novel of same name all three stars are wasted with exception who is given far too much screen time !
if i hear cera scream one more time!!! !
its an ok movie , but believe me after you've seen it 5 million times really sucks .
what an embarrassing movie ! watching a little rat in cowboy boots , running major coorperation small town inhabited by guniea pigs ? terrible excuse .
what an amazingly racist movie , but then again that's the trend in most disney films . one highlight is song about native americans savages dirty stinkin' indians !
pocahontas is a 1995 disney film that based upon the life of an indian woman few hundred years ago and how her changed when she became part man's . it's as bad it sounds , but worse not what you'd expect from gets too boring annoying
ok , usualy i like kid movie's just as much little kids . am 15 years old and didnt the movie at all tohught maybe it was me b/c im to 4 so boy babysitted(4 or 5) also only thing that confuses is my 19 year brother loved !
3 words : read the book ! come on , it's only 70 pages or so . charlotte's web watership down this movie is not will be quickly forgotten
now , this is the type of film that caused disney and i to part company until they redeemed themselves with likes lion king  . might have stayed loyal longer had not insulted my intelligence kind simplistic tripe love bug was one several films came across as very one-dimensional lacked wit flare just silly know it a big hit in its day but case anyway joined ranks quickly produced lame-o post-walt stuff you too often found occasionally being churned out by apparently for no other reason than make quick buck their moola history resources real excuse thing
i love david spade , but this movie was terrible . it is the worst disney has ever made with hercules just slightly ahead they tried too hard and didn't work
once again good actors and a bad movie .
this is the worst movie i've ever seen!! ! only part that was funny in when he sarcastically said a leaf would attack him . i can't believed wasted 12 bucks(half for me and half my date) to see movie! don't watch it unless your under 10 years old ay
swiss family robinson was the most boring disney feature i have ever gone through in my life . it a very bad experience watching this film , as tried mixing sound of music with gilligan's island nope didn't work walt
another dreamworks animated diaster that just makes animation so they could compete with disney when are much worse . it's a woody allen comedy who loads of jokes for adults not any kids the plain sucks( ants looked liked aliens) while story is very long and boring skip it
spare me . nothing could be worse
why not an animated series of charlie's angels ? it'd be the same product . jimmy neutron is one those obnoxious films that you want to walk out just because annoying background music poor martin short....poor short
my opinion is that if walt disney had actually been frozen and he was brought back to life , would see the dumb movies his company has made over last few years have a heart attack die- again .
sould be titled you can't go home again . trying to capitalize on classic childrens story with big names one of the best examples what not do when adapting literature
quite simply , i hated this movie . dustin hoffman's scenery-chewing captain hook was annoying and robin williams gets unintentional laughs as peter pan running around in that ridiculous outfit the lost boys are a bunch of little brats heathens who need their behinds thrashed even julia roberts' usual charm wore thin tinkerbell is definitely one steven spielberg's lesser efforts
wake me up when it's over .
it's horrible the animated version is awesome but , this terrible imtatiaon rules! ! one sucks!
bad career move , bruce.. .
this film is about as hilarious police academy 5...yes it's that bad . two horrible performers wasted in a
i really hate annie both the production and kid . unlike mary poppins which liked in spite of some musical numbers , side just seems to work against story kept wanting say shut up tell me something also if want see a bunch kids sing who can t ll accompany friend or relative their child s next grade school choir recital basically think lot shallow points all merged here create one large annoying movie experience for things like hair (comb it out you drip!) carol burnett part (arrrgh what jerk not funny way) grating songs (ahhhh my ears) lack much plot (i stopped caring about her plight early on) rushed pace (calm down will ya!) was sorry took chance with this back when first released wasted money on ticket no fear that would ever rent even
i want to say enjoyed but didn't it . nearly fell asleep i'm surprised was disappointd and don't think this film has anything good about unless your a 3d fan , try avoid summary : boring stupid that doesn't have much
i was expecting a lot from this movie . the graphics were good , but story awful it slow boring and very pointless
i personatly wished cats would win . they make much more fun(and nicer) pets than dogs in my opinion
okay , now this kind of film even for kids is a real insult to filmgoers everywhere . in spite all its dynamic advertising and cool posters it turned out be nothing that special just series grotesque animal fights with dodgy cgi tacky weapons the fact tried preach theory cats are evil it's only thanks companionship dogs we're happy free didn't do any favours i like myself actually found alarmingly offensive particularly portrayal 'cat people' as fat drippy women horrific 'educational' cartoon ancient egyptian history which everything gets disgustingly distorted but couldn't make best such dubious concept script was poor disappointingly slow-paced jokes i'd heard thousand times before puppetry chinese hairless pathetic plot tissue-thin acting both people voices really bad trained gave life soul little attempt made develop characters ones (the least said about those irritating 'humans' better) ? puppy an adult voice accidentally called upon protect scientist working on cure dog allergies from trying take over world very tedious your deserve better than if you're lover you'd probably off giving miss cat avoid hell !
take the animals to a chinese restraunt or something .
i was suprised to see cats and dogs even make it the top 300 here . just very boring dull
this movie had the potential to be very good . i thought it was great for first three minutes then turns out that cats and dogs are smarter than humans , they use all of these james bond type equipment fight each other it's so unreal wanted hurl !
bad movie !
looney tunes has been around for at least 50 years . isn't it time to retire ?
way too many adult jokes while the animation was pathetic.(the fish looked like aliens!!!) overall worst animated film of year and quite possibly i ever saw!! !
dreamworks continues to prove they make anti-white propaganda films . white people have no business helping this hostile organization financially by paying see their movies
hate it ! there's no songs to sing along .
i wasted 7 f**king dollars seeing this movie in theaters!!! !
too bad i can't give it a zero or lower!! ! hate spongebob!! dumbest character ever!!
worse movie ever
totally uneven and boring movie .
is it possible to ruin a great franchise with single stroke . history has taught us so and this classic case of that phenomenon when you start adding new horrible characters like dil things rolling down hill pretty fast makes another nikelodeon totally ruined by putting on the big screen
has anyone else noticed that ever since this disasterous movie came out , the rugrats show been downright awful ?
the epitimy of stupid
hated every moment of this movie . the daughter is best show and she couldn't save it hope stars can sleep at night 3-d effect adds nothing to
madeline is such a bad excuse for an animated feature , that they didn't even give the characters of eyes ! book series was cute but trying to make movie out only had few words page mindless .
it was awful they put that brat jane in there i love wendy she is sweet but , hate (yuck) then replaced the cool crocodile with a stupid squid and story original peter pan it's awesome fact one of my favorite movies this cheapquel stinks!! !
despite some good special effects , this film is ruined by two forced truly silly and horrid performances frankie muniz hilary duff . their chemistry horrendouz to make things worse it uses angie harmon as the old sex goddess attract young teens yummy ! avoid at all costs
i can remember seeing the borrowers in movie theaters when it came out , and didn't want to see but my friend dragged me . hated this was so god-awful john goodman's character annoying
w-o-r-s-e m-o-v-i-e e-v-e-r!! ! don't see this crapfest!! so boooooring
not a good movie . too much like tha first one !
who in the right mind would watch this movie ? it could bore you to tears worse than margaret atwood .
i hope it isn't bad as most dtv(direct to video)disney releases .
stupid movie . not worthy of the disney family
beyond stupid , i regret taking my kids to see this lame movie . disney can do better than !
very fake , even for a kids movie . what professional basketball player drives buick park avenue ? obviously underfunded all players have escalades
hey li'l bow wow : give it up .
this was the worst basketball movie since air up there  .
this show was never popular enough to warrant a big screen release . not worth rental
not good
eddie murphy stars in the big screen release of a popular disney ride . what works for 'pirates' does not work this movie jennifer tilly has it her contract that she must be voice if they ever rework
i thought this movie was going to be like pirates of the caribeean . boy wrong ! not scary and unfunny got sick dead people joke only good thing about madame leota take my advice skip
and the world needed another rugrats movie because................ ?
here are some of the crude references in this movie : -an acronym for word s . h i t -the cat picks up a hoe yard and says , "you dirty hoe!" makes reference to an erection when he looks at kids' mom's photo chops off his tail (there's no blood) screams son (it is bleeped out) never smiled during certainly laughed it offensive but not funny boring do see film under any circumstances let children or their childhood memories hat will be shattered before eyes
one way to try capture popularity . but the wrong add dr seuss' legacy this movie should have never been made
sucks , need i say more this was mike myers' worst move
disgraceful . dr seuss should rise from the dead and strangle mike myers
horrible movie for a very overrated kids game . it might as well have been in french
corny and pointless . how matt leblanc starred with one the movie saw release is beyond me
i respect anyone who has had the guts to make as many come backs olsens have , but am just not into their new stuff .
a family movie for the most bored of families . not to watch or rent ben kingsley should know better somewhat cool ship can't save this
no go
jus when you thought the horror was over , it comes right back . pokemon is new neverending story (along with star trek)
not again !
i actually like some of the pokemon movies and recently was very dissapointed in yu-gi-oh movie damnit 4kids entertainment . why didnt you leave way it anyway don't digimon to begin with so this just sucks really is a except without decent animation at least bad should'nt even have rating but cant not give i'll be nice 1
digimon is exactly like pokemon
i liked it the first time when was called pokemon movie ......oh , wait no didn't .
it sucks ! a wannabe pokemon movie .
mindless crap
digimon : the movie may be worst experience in a theater or your own house that you have ever experienced life . cant make out of these stupid japensese cartoon guys , and it is just so boring tasteless mindless
biggest load of s*&t i've ever had the misfortune to see in my entire life
doesnt make the grade . this move is unsuitable for little children yet too childish adults troupe knocked out by poppies an educated person can tell that are producers of opium so it implies these heroes really druggies loveable charecters whom want to be like influence them do things majority might not have done if movie was shown
even as a child , i hated this movie . it was so dull and predictable
is it bleedin aagghhwwww www www? ! -dastardly lion
dorothy is boring . this movie really ruined the excellent children's books by l frank baum direction was sloppy and message preachy housewives , bring 2 martinis a tub of olives to make bastardization literature go down better
this is one of the worst books i have read . am against racism , and book all about it a copy that also has very tiny print so you to watch what/when bought as words are small it's almost impossible
was going good until it got to the court scene . horribly edited and very boring
i thought the book was great because of all adventures scout and her friends had . another reason why it good is deep into details
the movie and book are two different things . was told from one perspective , another gave specific details about characters didn't give anything but name of character some scenes in did happen most major never made it into
purely overrated . some good elements , but the ending is so pathetic as if everyone in town would pitch money for a disliked unpopular person
maudlin crap . capra's worst film
boring!! !
who let this get so high up the list ?
amazing how this movie holds up . the atmosphere alone makes it a must see  alfred was in top form on one true classic
absolutely overrated and dated . chemistry between bergman bogart ? forget it

other then titanic this is the most overated movie of all time . talk about stating obvious , tomorrow another day give me a break dialogue terrible and story week if book was published today it would be one those trashy novels that women read
i tried , really .  .it's too dated unwatchable i'll never go hungry again ! yikes
frankly my dear i do not give a damn about this movie .
i have never understood why people like this trash . it's melodramatic , unbelievable fantasized etc if liked it for those reasons that would be understandable--just a matter of personal taste however they describe as were some great example fine acting phooey ! put in the same category birth nation romanticized racist drivel
if you have trouble falling asleep then i prefer gone with the wind . someone pretty much made me watch this.. and every time think of this film start to get a little sleepy!! ! why people rate high is beyond me.. that obviously their own opinion , but wow.. snooze fest ever seen one!!
one of the greatest and worst 'chick' flicks . why women romanticize these 'period' pieces (pun intended) is beyond me - you had no rights ! if saw a legit representation time period , it wouldn't be pretty look like this phony hollywood schlock honestly find plantations slaves cotton civil war to fantastic backdrop romance then need ratchet your sense drama down couple notches not say leads weren't great actors (they are make turkey such favorite) just that selznick brand moviemaking left wondering what big deal was
i hate these kind of movies
gone with the wind has to be one of worst movies i have ever seen in my life . words can not describe disappointment this movie , especially after hearing so much hype as how wonderful was and etc guess when debut 1939- it a great for time however by today's standards is nothing but trash could help laughed through most because acting bad kind feel sorry people who remember considered movie- clearly shows far united states america come since dark ages oppressive south
i couldnt even sit all the way through this clunker , so maybe my opinion isnt that valid . movie just doesnt work found it unwatchable
i hate this movie! ! don't know why it has such a great rep , can't compare to sunset blvd . and definately not nearly as bette davis performance her w.b films
2 words she sucked and she's ugly
rediculous- fonda makes himself both defense attorney and witness during deliberations- politicak correct claptrap
12 angry men made me sick .
sorry , but i found it long and boring . maybe it's because expected too much as can remember i've heard read about what a great picture this is (rated #1 by the national film institute) when compare citizen kane (1941) casablanca (1942) its like night day storyline acting cinematography in are vastly superb to
boring just because for its time it had good camera angles this made on #1 the top 100 best films of all .
i'm sorry , but it's about a sled . named rosebud maybe i missed something didn't like it at all think overrated
i've tried , really to get into this movie . never been able make it half-way through maybe i need stick out and watch the whole don't know from what have seen of just big deal is one you can enlighten me..
no one was in the room when he said his last words
this is a really , bad movie . it amazes me that flick has the following does....the writing pathetic and acting not much better....a good money maker in its day but lousy picture all round
i thought this movie was so boring it lacked substance and character
dr . strangelove is an extremly boring and dull movie that was unimaginativly made , peter sellers makes a total fool of himself it's dark gothic just totally stupid
three words describe this movie to me - dull , . and it was saying a lot for get impression because i first saw when still enjoyed westerns didn t have clue as how little folklore had do with reality especially the ones that love story going on however just could not take practically comatose subtlety of gary cooper s low-key acting style he only put sleep but also looked more like ice princess grace kelley father than her hubby unfortunately unlike western genre denial masculine age pairing old dudes young chicks persists in hollywood seems exactly what is pathetic attempt make man feel look younger oh by way doesn work
wow . if you are not gay , this movie is your cup of tea the fruity dancing basketball players ? street fight dance unwatchable
real tripe . starring the worst actor ever puked out onto public by hollywood star system a tremendous bore
what is funny about this movie ? ok , first screwball comedy ever but it's not ! how could anyone possibly laugh???? most overrated of the 30s one most...ever . very good though
this movie was , like totally boring . who wants to watch a talentless crone smoking cigarettes and prostituting herself ?
i hated this movie because of mickey rooney's performance . he was terrible , honestly donned coke-bottle glasses and buck teeth to play a japanese guy how mean can rooney be ? seriously being asian is not crime audrey hepburn she didn't seem pack much talent more the looks type famous packed visually
if you look into the movie its about a slutty girl who sells her body for slightest things such as feeding cat . she befriends gigalo and then they fall in love overall this sucked i would sincerely reccomend not seeing it
i agree with the squeamish feeling , this movie offends any person knowledge of actual history . only who could enjoy would be somebody nazi propaganda from world war ii it is that objectionable and disgusting
i know should be critical of the film for it's cinematic value as well historic place in cinema but...i can't get through it . offends my squeamish bone
even worse than ben-hur . a waste of film and an embarassment to anyone remotely associated with this abortion
although the movie is nearly devoid of objectionable content (aside from occasional profanity) , there are two things that absolutely destroy . first songs extremely grating and annoying second sexism in this production outrageous no more obvious than shockingly-inappropirate ending completely different short story pygmmalion 1964 based on i just can't recommend
one of kubrick's less known films about the absurdity war , specifically french suicide attacks during trench fighting wwi . based on actual events this is a very powerful anti-war film
typical james dean boring stuff , not to mention the cigs...... .
the title says it all . characters have no motives or personality
fiddler on the roof is really , lame .
this movie should have been about 30 mins long . how much motorcycle riding does one need the characters don't any real mission , they just ride i never fallen asleep during a before but was dangerously close watching beyond shadow of doubt top ten worst movies i've ever seen agree with flano sixties summed up in it's trash
more boring than rebel without a cause...... .
went to the movies watch this and couldn't see a thing , what waste of money!!! !
the only reason i watched this movie was because of rita hayworth's famous striptease  , and it turned out that thing worth watching . so bad couldn't even watch whole saw first 30 mins pressed fast forward to scene then shut off
another classic awful movie with james dean , thankful that he only made three movies boring stuff cigs... .
this movie was great !
monty python is boring . just another famouse name which meant to make me think 'this going be a good movie.'
i know i'm going to get killed for this but is it possible hate movie . because do all the jokes were way too over-the-top be funny funniest stuff you couldn't understand of their british accents and ending didn't make much sense if want comedies watch airplane , naked gun movies pink panther who frammed roger rabbit not kidding enjoy film credits before was
i thought this was the tbn cast doing another telethon .
prolly the dumbest movie ive seen this year !
not funny
i sure am in the minority here but could never laugh at this !
all i can say is hate this movie and can't believe you thought it was good enough to rate first .
this movie absolutly sucked !
ignorant , lowest common denominator crap . i knew better jokes when was in grade 5
punny . gets old after a while
it is an old man's film , i think this because my dad watches over and its so boring ! does he have any taste ?
it was corny [beans make you fart - come on!] is this funny ?
this movie had one funny scene . i thought war really overrated
blazing saddles is the last spoof you'd want to have on your wish list . it never , ever funny and an embarrassment mel brooks who really tried his best westerns but this movie totally dull boring characters are introduced film then dropped from script not heard again
i seldom walk out of movies , but in this case made an exception .
a movie about family's pain and suffering on their journey to an amusement park for vacation . it's sort of dark comedy with bit happy ending , but not enough justify the trip watching people suffer just isn't my idea humor
national lampoon movies are very rarely ever good . they resort to lowbrow humor which send many running from their vcr (i could never see a dumb movie like this making it dvd) the acting stink and jokes smell worse go away , bad !
total crap .
don't understand the appeal of this one .
good concept ruined by rodney dangerfield and poop jokes . ted knight is the only bright spot
that whole scene with the feces floating in pool really grossed me out ! and why hell would a guy eat it ? sorry , but when i was done this almost threw up . even if supposedly just baby ruth 
bill murray always manages to come up with new holidays for morons . this was one of the bottom ten worst movies i have ever managed sit through absolutely and completely stupid !
just dreadful . but what else could it be , having that awful book as a basis
yet another r-rated horror , this time set in an office one is also filled to the brim with bad acting boring execution and gobs of objectionable content . there are over 80 uses profanity again for reasons i can begin fathom most often used worst f-word sexual (although not nearly as much worthless american pie or brain-dead martin lawrence : runteldat course drug use alcohol present but what else would you expect from writers stupid beavis butt-head series on network brain-deads mtv stay out run a certain federation starship catch some pokemon let it snow !
pretty bad .
any movie with ben stiller as the lead is in dire trouble . he plays same tired charactor everything does no variation i loathe
f**king idiotic .
i'm the black sheep here - i didn't think movie was funny . no real man would have ever put up with that kind of crap  .(okay , sex-toys in suitcase thing funny)
although it has one or 2 amusing moments , again turns too raunchy for its own good and distatesful visual gags many sex jokes much profanity . about the only light are occasionally-amusing parents who swim in out of tasteful yucky acting is still sub-par except father plot innane avoid this movie !
rich in craptacualarity !
simply not funny . poorly directed squandered de niro i don't see what all the fuss is about
i dont know why everyone likes this movie it is bad . isnt even that funny robert deniro what you were thinking when agreed to do see and hoe the sequil called meet faukers
i thought that meet the parents was one of worst movies have ever seen . didn't care about characters at all we never got to fully understand ben his fiance's relationship , therefore not caring whether they through this obstacle meeting her it wasn't funny so bored and annoyed with movie actually looking away from screen how nerve racking is significant others but just too ridiculous do a sense humor like stupid entertaining horrible predictable took parts since you knew what coming up stiller good fiance robert deniro used be great he okay in rubbed me wrong way ended walking out 15 minutes left want see get back together ? well no also would after walked if harsh....but really
fred gwynee of the legendary tv-g comedy series , munsters was in this piece useless junk ? forget it . r is another underrate and not funny go see ice age pokemon4ever or star trek : nemesis instead
what a train wreck ! coming after the brilliant animal house i expected greatness , but oy hackneyed stupid schlock .
the blues brothers is not a musical....not comedy...not classic....it's crap ! this movie extremly long and tired . it's never , ever funny belushi akroyd can't act in like their scripts were written by monkeys on roller skates or something avoid at all costs
stupid
i tend to enjoy british comedy , but this really sucks .
and i thought holy grail was bad . really unfunny
holy grail was way better .
marking a sad turn in the python franchise , from pg to r rating . believe me really bad profanities are nowhere near as brilliant fish-slapping dance of saying ni ! avoid this one and stick with their older stuff instead
what a joke . this was the stupidest movie with worst music clooney is good at picking movies to act in
uh-uh . not scary
this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen . read review in my local paper it touted as a wonderful comedy where you'll laugh from beginning to end it's two years later now , and i'm still waiting for first let me give you some honest advice though if like coen brothers classic think their stuff boring most of them all
incredibly poor attempt at mirroring homer's great work the odyssey . this movie could not have gotten more boring
z-z-z-z-z . when i saw this movie in a theater , the was divided into three groups of people group #1 laughing hysterically from time static came on to credits at end ended #2 sitting there stone-faced and/or sleeping #3 occasionally giggling music sucked acting horrible and only laughed during religious talk they had throughout whole freakin' george clooney looked like he about puke being chained john tuturro tim blake nelson their presence might well have been what ruined for me please everyone sake your sanity bank accounts do not buy/rent/think watching take care !
like most of m . night shalyman's films , boring predictable and unscary it had me wondering how anyone would waste their hard earned cash on dreck this bruce willis gives his usuall less than steller preformance he is considered by some to be a great actor beyond the one bright spot was acting hayley joel osmet who has future in pictures if can avoid clunkers
rubbish
all i can say is it's terrible.( just a thought )
miserable , excremental asinine garbage . its gags are obvious predictable and without exception loathsome lowbrow the movie was about as funny a burst colostomy bag subtle
mike myers is about as funny a stucco bathtub . this movie less humourous than that
i'm almost afraid to rate this so low considering its widespread popularity , but i absolutely hate it . find the supposed'humor' be crude disgusting and not funny at all characters are obnoxious make whole movie going experience painful
i can't remember even smiling at this movie once .
too corny for me .
takes to long . boring
totally unfunny movie that had perhaps two decent scenes in it . this garbage is best suited for the mental retards who think adam sandler and other imbecile , jim carry are a hoot george w loves which tells you alot only saving grace of film was art direction as rest pure dreck
i hated this movie . thats right it austin powers is the most annoying person i've ever met there no humor trash at all- and some of you said that maury was garbage ! if , what hell stuff?
this is funny ? ok...if you say so ! crude humor wheels around a man that no woman could find attractive and government would trust . if want good spy comedy , watch the tv-g get smart on best tv station of all time land unlike powers brushes his teeth
i just don't get it .
this movie was actually more retarded than i had expected . the scene with coconuts and hurleys tits like huh , are you fugging serious ! south park is 1000 times stupid crude funny piece of dumbsh*t in fact mike myers only snl hyperhypo man now thats funny,harharharhar.....youpatheticfools
really stupid film , not funny at all .
from what i'd heard this movie was par to monty python . so i rented it all remember about waking up drool over my nice new leather couch
i couldn't sit through more than 5 minutes of this .
i'd prefer to give a negative 1 star if it were possible . i didn't enjoy this movie , find funny and could have found something better do with my time was just plain stupid
it was horrible . very perverted and kids should not watch meaningless
predictable !
a long political satire than comedy . peter seller's great talent is waisted and very slow that the best joke weren't really funny only part fabulous title if you want films star sellers watch pink panther movies
this is a comedy ? i can't believe people rated it high - not funny to me .
a pure work of genius . testement to why we should let the left-wing take over country and even run military kubrick knows best give me friggin' break what s@it festival
not funny!! !
dr . strangelove or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb is one of best titles i've ever heard while movie most unfunny , unimaginative pieces trash seen extremly dark gothic really felt umcomfortable watching it
adam sandler sucks !
aside from the ever-gleeful sight of seeing adam sandler decked by a man who knows family-friendly entertainment (go , bob barker legendary host price is right!) or anyone for that matter this yet another r-rated golf comedy does know wrong and no right . avoid at all costs except scene where stupid course
one of the stupedist sci-fi movies ever , so stupid that its not even funny . shamala is a crook who comes up with rip off screen plays he should change to shaman which fits his negative iq more appropriately everybody remember don't go see any last time i checked he's being paid what all our forefathers combined salary : something like 50 million or for screenplay needs stop selling fraudulent crap and shoot himself
i really don't think adam sandler's that funny . he's too slapstick ! gimme shaun micallef any day - got wit , not just silly voices
predictable !
i laughed only once during all of 'happy gilmore,' and it was at a joke that can't be printed here . adam sandler is funny man , but not when he throwing clubs around in general acting like spoiled immature brat the plot twists are stupid fake hand grotesque ending has type roll-your-eyes cheesiness makes so bad it's almost good key word though 'almost.'
i can't believe this was such a success ! am proud to say that actualy stayed awake through half of the film . not what expected from team mathau and lemon ; odd couple films were hilarious but don't buy hype people very boring movie
i saw it when was younger thought exteremly boring but maybe should see again might like .
as good it gets is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen!! ! love greg kinnear , cuba gooding jr . and helen hunt so was extremely disapointed this lame attempt at comedy with a heart just so...bad her acting in movie are we actually to believe someone like would fall jack nickolson?? ? ha yeah right!!
i will say this once. . hate helen hunt !
a lame , dull boring pointless waste of time .
not really a fan of this movie . i prefer classic nicholson flicks like the shining  was pretty lame-o , real munson steaming piece crap loser
could that movie have been just a little longer ? i wasn't bored quite long enough .
i will never understand why anyone has anything good to say about this movie . walked out of the theatre amazed at crap had just seen couldn't connect reviews what witnessed go figure
this is spinal tap was a failed attempt to spoof rock n roll groups , and it directed by rob reiner . the characters in film are totally annoying crude they acts like total punks fools music too loud screeching enjoy at very least i think that went bit far with one
this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen.i never understood its popularity.might appeal to 5th graders,or adults with zero sophistication .
as an army vet , it's hard to laugh when each scenario gets more preposterous than the one before . two beautiful permanent-party mps are not going bonk a couple ugly boots in commanding officer's home entire platoon would have at best gone stockade for that graduation debacle nobody much less unit goes straight from basic escorting secret weapon europe and they certainly don't take their mp babes with them start wwiii penn & teller should do episode of b***s*** ! on this movie i know only but one's even remotely accurate sergeant bilko (tv or movie) its ridiculous premise was closer real thing
unfunny and unwatchable bill murray vehicle , with bad screenplay confusing plot .
not funny.. . needed more work
overrated , and very boring . i was so disappointed after all the hype long lines at movie theatre in fact pissed ended up leaving 15 minutes before ending don't recommend this pile of junk to anyone..
my mom forced me to watch this . i was so bored , fell asleep nothing really happens didn't get more than 1 laugh in
i don,t know what all the good press was about ! this movie boring and definetly not funny
what do people see in this movie . it is not funny there little or no plot the acting poor , just nothing good about
watching this movie is like eating bad breath . terrible even mean girls better , and that hurts to say.. but boobies beat ass-crack any day don't see
terrible movie that deserves no awards .
i want 2 hours of my life back . if you didnt live in fraggle rocks garbage heap dont bother
making fun of chinese and black people does not make a good movie !
the only thing i lied was jim
any jim carey movie is totally predictable and boring .
this movie is so damn weak . i don't know if disney affiliated with piece of garbage but they aren't , should be the premise for pretty childish and courtroom scenes are pathetic jim carrey stick to doing movies like dumb dumber cable guy 
booooorrrrrriiiiinnnnnggggg!!!! !
errol and i have had some differences , but will fully back him up on this . what a trashy film
here's another crude terror from the evil brothers named farrelly . sadly , this started slide of sewage that are teen comedies now-a-days and it only has one purpose : to gross-out let's just say aside fact constant profanity i cannot site examples as why is so bad except they extremely sexually suggestive
what is the big deal about this movie ? to me it just unsuble , annoying comedy .
when humor this crude and mean-spirited is considered one of the greatest comedies ever by so many people , i am convinced that our society has pretty much totally lost it .
there's nothing worth a damn about mary .
i rented this movie after hearing all the hype about it . was worst have ever seen may chuckled once , but good dramas usually put more amusing lines in a film truly horrible !
this movie , although many thought it was very funny i felt stupid and ben stiller is incredibly annoying .
disappointing
ok i am the only one think from what glanced at that hated this movie . :( sorry:( really have no opinion just didnt like it for some reason
i admit that this is a very good movie , but gave it one star because not horror movie!!! !
this movie sucked . o brother where art thou? , now that's a funny
a bunch of cheese this one is . wow it cheesy !
what a dog(ma) of movie . yuck
sacreligious . some things are sacred and shouldn't be poked fun at i'm down for laughing almost everything , but not my beliefs
well i guess i'm in the minority here but thought movie was terrible and boring to boot! ! sure premise of being able see dead people is spooky all somewhere there seem have gotten so swept up by whole idea it that they forgot how corny much with bruce willis walking around city trying sort out this little kids (and his own) problems . c'mon work me more a drama than horror oh no there's pastey faced girl under my bed she wants go deliver box mommy daddy!!! oooohhhh now don't get wrong if found nightie hiding you can bet i'd freak extreme one things for wouldn't catch running errands her while your would be kind as stop off at mummy daddys drop something ever indebted
this show sucked ! so does jay and silent bob what was even the storyline ? i got bored during crap that failed to pay attention . only thing made it worth staring at for one second chris rock if he wasn't in then would have no plot whatsoever
stupid movie .
a super one time movie , but it's not of those repeated viewing movies which is important when rating it overall . won't stand the test trust me  !
an absolutely dreadful film , not because of its blasphemous contents but rather it was so juvenile and such a mish-mash oddments thrown together . did anyone notice how the guy who didn't speak copied all his facial expressions from joey in friends! !
would fit right in with boston public its crude style of humor . watch happy days for some great high school comedy , but not this !
man shoot willes , than he talks to the boy of whom you know dad
i really enjoyed the first one but as much like austin powers hated 2 . it was not very funny with a lot of bathroom humor , more so than spy spoof enough mike look for some thing new have seen 3 yet looked about same stuff re-hashed update : and right
somebody put this movie out of it's misery . just a thought
dreadful . even worse than the first one
it was kind of corny,and nasty .
i really tried to like it but it's not funny . worse than the first one
i really , hate it when bad movies get a sequel and good ones don't . austin powers is fool so are the writers of this lowbrow moronic comedy understand appeal movie jokes gross what call under-the-top which means situation not played up for in clean way resorts to garbage can instead watch
this one was just as bad the horrible first .
i trully can't believe this film was so popular . even from the previews could tell jokes were purely sickening and just not funny you would think they learn their lesson after first one
if i could would get all the austin powers 2 vhs and dvd videos over at my house , take them out back a fat dump on of .
don't bother - #1 was bad enough .
i went to see this movie with high enthusiasm and was quite let down . it not worth spending $8 on the same jokes as original were used , most times less effectively than first austin powers new characters mainly fat bastard served for a few laughs but overall it's must
so bad it is good ? i don't see the attraction to this movie . acting was terrible , story barely a heard people describe dialog as brilliant personally felt like teenager wrote script hopping from topic disjoint that keeps overall moving wading knee-deep in circles and ultimately going absolutely nowhere
what kind of drivel is this ? it doesn't bother me that black and white , because some my favorite movies (bringing up baby aresnic old lace) are . does the complete utter lack talent creativity found in overrated film entire setting situation wholly uncreative a gas station good grief also dialogue peppered with mean-natured scatalogical jokes foulest words kevin smith should have never gotten into business
ah , here lies proof that kevin smith is overrated !
a plotless film- i generally have nothing against films , in fact i've enjoyed whole lot of them . but this one just made me sick atrocious acting parts were funny did not enjoy clerks
low budget is one thing . concept another where was the comedy ? i wish could have given it zero stars
quite possibly the worst movie i've ever seen . kevin smith must have sold his soul to devil a career what hack
obnoxious chick flick . i hope meg ryan's next flight crashes in a cannibal country
this movie was really bad . it boring , not funny and pretty dorky could have been way better just change the screen play
this movie was horrible . it not funny at all everyone that i've ever talked to also say his is one of sandra bullock's worst performanes i think she on her last two legs with , and they just got cut off a real sleeper expect anything but entertainment from horrid film
what a piece of garbage . people should suit
duh ! it gets two stars for the wisdom of using candice bergen and loses one them wasting her .
adam sandler sucks !
adam sandler can't act . would someone mind telling me why he stars in so many movies ?
i just can't seem to get into adam sandler's films . while he is a decent comedian , act and his never have any cohesive plot them
it was watchable but that about and i can only take charles grodin in small amounts .
this has got to be one of the stupidest , most unfunny piece or tripe i have ever seen . grodin and de niro whould known better than make a turkey like when see it scheduled on tv find something else do so won't turn accidently assinine movie absolutly hate
from what i've heard and seen of the movie , it is one those teenaged movies which based on sex . that a lot garbage because crude sends signal to young people popularity live for cheap dirty thing plus tells swaring cool i remember there used be an old song called american pie was very good even glorified god amazing how sin can stuff things up when properly sweet clean signifies spiritual physical bondage between husband wife not out marriage or anything other then
one of the saddest wastes cinema that is out there . its hard to imagine creative , well-acted upbeat movies like star trek : nemesis wars attack clones pokemon 4ever daddy day care and down with love get bad reviews from critics mouthed by most other teens first all plot patently offensive a group high school vowing lose their virginity prom night ? it would be good if they were rejected realized had treat women respect but doesn't happen instead sex treated just any need--such as air shockingly in this movie are perverted males ! you think makes filled gills role models--stand for more example an extremely mean-hearted prank played on someone causing them have...stomach problems people who do punished no course profanity rules cut multiple times being nc-17 end aren't taught lesson or thrown jail females don't go seeking gentlemen thus complete waste time--full humor positive models side nothing
horrible
it sucked...not a funny movie .
a really bad un-funny movie , couple of cute scenes does not make good comedy  !
i love crude , obnoxious teen sex movies but only when they're funny . this one fails terribly
the most non humorous comedy ever !! ! this movie sux . some teen comedys are pretty funny and captures high school shenanigans , one does not terrible cast aside from father
only in the us could you think this passes for humor (sic)
i thought this movie was derivative and not funny at all .
this movie was horrible!!!drew's character lucy had to live the same day over and until she died!!!also,the more about that than her relationship with adam sandler!!!what drew thinking by making godawful film!!!"doppelganger-the evil within" better slop!!!hasn't been torchered enough?!!!those of you who haven't seen film,but want to;take my advice:don't!!!!see "the wedding singer" instead!!!'cause believe me,it's a much film one!! !
i dont know whats happening to adam sandler .
this is a real disappointment , i was expecting lot more from christophor guest and eugene levy . it not funny movie actually kind of sad how these people pour their entire lives into dogs if you have to see wait until shows up on cable
dry boring humor . i walked out on this one
i hate these mocumentaries because of the camera style (shaky , not steady) and acting (full stuttering pauses monotone speech) . this is no exception
this is one of those movies that when you are leaving the theatre hope your not reckognized . movie sucked ! i have been a dog owner and like dogs but sitting down watching bunch eccentric freaks parade their made me sick was comedy it tragedy group gets treated better than most humans
get over it , this movie just plain old sucks . there is not one bit of good chemistry between cher and nicholas cage so annoying he looks horrible didn't know how to act when was young proves here neither can let's the point peoples !
a hillarious movie oh sure,not!! !
how can they call this a comedy ? i don't think laughed one time . sure wayne and garth were funny on snl but the movie is horrible
this is the worst movie ever made ! only stoners like . if i could have one erased from history , would be (and i've seen all pauly shore's movies)
yet another cardboard cut-out , let's go smoke pot and get high teenage sex humorless flick . this movie was not at all entertaining wasn't worth the price of rental
another total waste of space from america's most popular pot smoking duo...a completely idiotic movie in every way...no point whatsoever...do not your hard earned money buying this junk.. .
drugs aren't funny unless the morons using them get arrested !
this was a really sorry movie . huh ? what's the point total waste of my time i thought going to be scary , but it wasn't blair witch lot better
this movie is just a rip off of an old french film called le cauge aux follies .
i do not like any movie or show that focus' on gays god did create adam steve he created eve . (a male female)
it was very stupid !
this was junk . it not funny at all and there were alot of boring parts one jim carreys good movies
jim carey is not a good actor , and this movie unadulterated trash . the plot pointless full of childish one liners simple comedy for minded folks morgan freeman as god few bright points in banal piece
mediocre at best . a weak performance by jim carey punctuated nauseating shift to an even weaker morality play who among us could feel sorry for guy had great job and life in the first place give me camera mike off i go instant shoot public interest stories
what are people saying about this movie ? it was soooo bad ! somebody commented to me later that the first he's seen whose trailer explains entire . totally right save yourself $9.00 and just watch there were , maybe 2 funny scenes terrible
chevy isn't funny in any disguise .
best picture in 1977 over star wars . that's sickening to think about that just proves the academy voters were all a bunch of short nerdy idiots
hated it ! chris farley is a poor replacement for john candy and jim belushi , this movie proves . david spade whould be expelled from hollywood as his act getting way to old
this movie isn't worth watching if someone gave you the dvd free..assuming it is on already...do not waste your money this...it just another idiotic chris farley nightmare.. .
that john belushi wannabe chris farley couldn't be funny even if he were a ten foot pole ! and this film is no exception . as usual , tries too hard he's not natural at anything except attempting self-exploitation.. may rip his career will last longer legend than it would've had lived
ouch , my skin is crawling . if you know anything about the prostitution business will find this extremely offensive theresa russell who 100 times as attractive roberts was incensed by movie and made whore in 1991 to show true side of
only thing funny about it is that they call a comedy . i didn't find the least bit oh well
an unfunny piece of garbage . hardly a comedy
pretty boring , unfunny and contrived you mean .
one of the worst films all time . ridiculous plot , assinine premise julia roberts is most unconvincing actress to come along in decades and richard gere not surprisingly acts like he's got a weasel shoved up his rectum predictable unentertaining totally unrealistic piece crap
put the video club membership card down and pick romance novel back up . this movie is awful julia roberts has done enough damage to those sad parts of american psyche that have actually paid any attention her my only regret in writing i may now be spawning next come around liking me movies
julia roberts is a wonderful actress today , but 10 years ago things were different . she was terribly overreacted in her roles and unfunny unstable nervous just too shy to star movies richard gere another story altogether
i don't know why this movie was such a big hit , it gay .
this one's a stinker . taking steps away from the pg-rated holy grail and tv-pg flying circus series , one has horrible sight gags just tons of sick stuff avoid at all costs i'll take knights ni fish slapping dance over dreck any day
just can't watch rubber sharks...... .
this film was a real low point in the movie careers of my favorite group british nuts . it has distinction being only monty python i truly did not care for classroom sex education demo skit sunk way too on common decency scale to even get an embarrassed laugh out me and will confess overlooking guiltily amused by some fairly crude things time should be re-titled lack meaning complete raunchiness or how let your lifelong fans down well , at least one anyway
booooo !
i did not think would like this movie and was right . totally pointless why they pick on john malkovich who really that interesting if it comes tv some night give a look but don't invest any money in
basically , it s-u-c-k-e-d.. .
another stupid movie . avoid
yuck ! this movie sucked so much!!!! what the hecl was point of making that thing?!?!?!? tasteless and bitter jokes , i didn't laugh once in . not best acting worst topic i've ever seen a about my whole life ugh wasted 2 bucks on piece ..
this movie is no even funny
awful
is there a half star that wuz the worst show i have seen period i'm not showing any sarcasm either so utterly boring would litterally die before watching it again saw no funny things or high points didn't even watch all . worse then battlefield earth joking
why do they continue to let hugh grant and sandra bullock refer themselves as actors ?
peice of sh*t movie ! even my girlfriend hated it- complete and utter crap . dont see ever!!!
never heard of this movie ? no wonder..it was one the lowest rated movies all time . don't bother watching or wasting your money
adam sandler sucks !
jaws is about as scary killer clowns from outer space . a complete waste of cinema...don't bother..
another very over rated movie , lili dolly and jane . this was dolly's first feature she the best two parts of i have never found to be all that funny well is dabney coleman suffers through abuse ladies force upon him movies brings some short lived life his carier good vehicle get started up other then it a bust ! ouch
very much overrated
this was sopposed to be a comedy movie ? you gotta kidding me-it sucked !
i dislike this movie alot
is reese on prozac or something ? this movie blows! !
waste of money !
sssstttuuupppiiiddd!! !
i had hoped to like this movie , but if just a boring storyline in my opinion . reese did good job with what she work i'd never recommend film
i hate will smith , he's so not funny or cool anymore .
fake !
will smith's acting abilities just could not save this film . worst special effects i have ever seen it was so fake pathetic
if you put will smith in a movie someone as talented tommy lee jones , know that are going to have one messy . men black is an extremly boring and unfunny comedy about secret agent who picks up partner off the streets must save universe from planet of scum
men in black was an awful example of a sci-fi movie . that doesn't deserve recognition
john cusack was in almost every scene . therefore , i hated it think he's probably a nice guy but definitely overrated successful only because other stars are his movies
this movie just wasn't that good . it was a long , boring story about guy has trouble finding the right woman
the best thing about south park on tv is that they push envelope and i love . this movie just awful it had no redeaming value what so ever was out to shock disgust really sad guy could have come up with a much better plot terrenance phillip suck show should never been in timmy rules
can you say 'stupidity'?? ? this has got to be the worst animated movie of century .
anyone that watches south park has to be a goof . i mean , the show holds record for most profanities this gets movie but frasier doesn't ! or star trek : deep space nine home improvement it's crazy tell you avoid at all costs it isn't rated-r nothing know..
it proves that cartoons are not meant for the big screen .
total blasphemous garbage .
bigger , longer uncut brain-dead unalterated junk . given the rating it has by today's juvenile airheads they make a great argument for total 'dicktatorships' this movie came to us via south end of jackass going north...
i'm still waiting for the funny parts.. .
was not impressed with the movie at all
total waste of money ! her only good movie was chicago , and i didnt even like that b/c
renee look at her smile
renee zellwegger : overrated .
the title describes people who paid good money to go seek this mutated turkey !
the title refers to intelligence of people who give it 5 stars .
one of the dumbest comedies ive ever seen .
...and dumber...and dumber.. .
bathroom humor is never funny to start with . this movie managed bore me and make sick at the same time
should have been called dumb and if you pay to watch it , are even dumber ! most comedians don't know the difference between inspired lunacy regular tasteless kind this is definitely latter .
this rating is only here because the site wont let you give it a nothing thank god that i did not pay to see moive
they weren't kidding
this movie was fake . jaws really looked bad acting it too unrealistic there are no sharks that eat people
this was probably one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time . word warning : it's called dumb and dumber for reason it starts out keeps getting i very disappointed jim carrey
i hate jaws . sharks in general they're the most ugliest things whole world my only phobia them ! awful movie
the title says it all . plot makes no sense , jokes aren't that funny and really only moment was both of them ? maybe if i enjoyed genre would've movie but didn't
the second worst movie of all time! ! first one is 'the cable guy.' jim carrey's suck!
eww disgusting . in my opinion , this show promotes homosexuality i mean come on a 30 year old man running around tights and his best friends an 11 gross
will tries to hard he just didnt make it funny
you've got to be kidding . isn't this a bit much for marketing ploy what wonderful reviews !
the movie is rather bland , with sparse moments of weak laughter to break drawn out predictable and dull events . i was all hyped up by commercials that looked so promising then utterly disappointed when left theater (which shouldnt have even entered) after 115 minutes infantilizing (and somewhat sleazy) humor awkward repetitious dialogue (ok get it 8 10 women think first kiss important let go already) youd a will smith kevin james would be hilarious but not best actors can make this clich laden script work on screen see another instead
the fema nazis loved this one . every man is a pig and deserves what he gets , because all guys cheat on their wives thats pretty much message in very unfunny movie about 3 spite filled women seeking revenge rotten husbands
just two words : not funny
sucked . i totally didn't get what all the hype was about
excuse me , these couldn't even be court jesters ! the original kings of comedy were masters like bob hope dick van dyke bill cosby desi arnaz danny thomas and a few others . stand-up routine based on dirty profanity-filled humor that is simply atrocious not recommended
awful movie. .
a shameless clinton apology from the meathead . , i thought you were acting when played ultra-liberal mike stivic was wrong stick with compelling films like this is spinal tap princess bride and even few good men (has liberal leanings but told in way - not an attempt to brainwash recent films) let me tell something buddy : are dead neck up meat-head
american president is quite simply , bad . it consists of a couple hours poorly disguised political dogma veiled over with relatively weak boring and predictable love story considering that was brought forth by annette bening michael douglas rob reiner the viewer really cannot expect anything less yet again forced to listen pontifications regard their views i must say am sick meathead trying tell me how run my life he should stick simpler non-effrontery comedy without motivations additionally characters are underdeveloped many them meander purpose through plot
most war movies are just terrible , nihilistic and dark . this one is no exception to that unfortunate rule
this movie isn't funny , not a bad for the period though !
a bad movie by actresses .
mira sorvino wonders why her career went downhill ?
looked really funny from the trailers , but ended up being just plain disgusting . how do wayans bros still find work ? if you want a dirty joke movie thats hilarious watch baseketball
i hate this movie it's gross and digusting ! i'm a big horror fan don't like the fact that they make fun of movies if halloween or texas chainsaw massacre phantasm gonna rip thier tongue out! biggest waste my time friend made watch with her geez humor does not really amuse me just
another dumb porn gore parody movie that is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo may i repeat soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid .
possibly the lamest , most low-brow piece of crap to ever hit silver screen . just a bunch sex jokes and stupid parodies that monkey could have thought actually no i take back comment is insulting monkey's another typical teen-style crude-fest avoid if you brain
more sickening then scarry . it just seemed like one big sex scene for about half the movie
this movie sucked !
another one for the airheads...while movie made a concerted effort at spoof , tasteless writing makes want to gag (no pun intended)...constantly falls back on every lobotomized producers fail-safe fall-back zero : f-word...not least bit 'funny' but obviously age genre this is geared towards would not know difference.. .
one of the dirtiest movies summer . it is a movie that can not enjoy with family people think american pie was bad , nothing compared to this i had literally leave because so
come on guys ! anyone who said this movie was even worth wasting your time is crazy i didn't think it would be the best  , but sooooo stupid . all about vulgur crap wasn't funny at all!! way to childish and corny
stupid , . it sucked ass and wasn't funny at all was boring the storyline terrible even parody aspect of bad
this movie is too stupid . it goes beyond funny(like jim carrey) , and stops at horribly funny
this movie sucked . there were a few funny parts but overall it wsa just really disgusting also , had absolutely no plot
what the heck was scary movie about ? man , it all penises and boobs ! had no point whatsoever . i thought going to be a funny good when saw commercial for so went go watch on first day came out dissapointed really expected much more
it sucked . i hated wasn't funny some parts were too explicit , like the deaths and showing a penis went with my ex-girlfriend usually movies she picks out are good but couldn't cover up this terrible movie
i thought this movie was dumb . should have went high seriously , laughed once
if there is a zero in the rating system , i would give it to this movie . could be that 'the biggest wast of time ever...' lost 2 hours my life watching 'stupid movie'
there is no plot but just a montage of recent horror movies . the previews do not reflect movie's poorly written seems like they wanted to show as many penises possible
this movie was a dissappointment . there were few clever moments , but most of the jokes are just vulgar and disgusting cheri o'teri is only highlight
